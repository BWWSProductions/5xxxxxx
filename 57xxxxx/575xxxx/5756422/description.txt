The present book explores the mechanisms and evolution of animal behavior, including neural, hormonal, and genetic substrates of behaviour; foraging; anti-predator defences; mating systems and sexual selection; social behaviour; communication; parental care; kin selection and recognition; and territoriality. This thoroughly up-to-date text shows how evolutionary biologists analyse all aspects of behaviour. It is distinguished by its balanced treatment of both the underlying mechanisms and evolutionary causes of behaviour, and stresses the utility of evolutionary theory in unifying the different behavioural disciplines. Important concepts are explained by reference to key illustrative studies, which are described in sufficient detail to help students appreciate the role of the scientific process in producing research discoveries. The writing style is clear and engaging: beginning students have no difficulty following the material, despite the strong conceptual orientation of the text. This is essential reading for degree-level students following modular programs in biology, zoology, marine biology, and psychology.
