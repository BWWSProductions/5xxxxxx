I didn't see a torrent for this episode around, so here it is. Sorry about the quality; it was obviously ripped from an analog TV source, and it shows. However, if you're interested in this stuff, it's worthwhile. It was rebroadcast recently on History Channel; if it comes up again I'll try to get a better rip.
