[Sadly, like other Good Eats torrents, this is missing the only season 13 episode I don't have, EA1319H  The Catfish Will Rise Again.  Hopefully some day someone will have a copy of that one.]"

,mud77,2010-08-20T00:21Z,More importantly. It's missing seeders :(
,vamosvaqueros,2010-09-21T03:33Z,"as omaham said, no catfish episode...based on the wikipedia episode list (not sure if i trust it, but i haven't done the other research) a few are slightly off...no big deal...also includes the double-length ""Twas the night before"" xmas episode"
