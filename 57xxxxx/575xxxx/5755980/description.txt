Alex welcomes back to the show New World Order researcher, author, and radio talk show host Alan Watt. With historical documentation, he shows how cultures are created and altered by those in control, always to lead the people like sheep into the next pasture. Watt was born in Scotland, where he watched the subtleties of politics and media as they guided the population of the U.K. covertly into a European Amalgamation. He is the author of the Cutting Through series, including The Androgynous (Hermaphroditic) Agenda, A Glimpse into the Great Work, and Esoteric Unveiled and the Meaning of Revelations in the High Masonic Tradition. Mr. Watt is featured in Alex Jones' film Fall Of The Republic: The Presidency of Barack H. Obama.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
