I'm going to save the humor and critic style on this description and just stress to everybody that this is absolutely the greatest thrash album to come out of the 80s. Unlike Dark Angel's Darkness Descends (another legendary album, look for my upload of it), it borrows elements from darker forms of metal, but for all the right reasons. What emerges from this combination is an absolute beast of an album, far beyond the scope of what words can describe. This is not Metallica. This is thrash metal. Listen to it for yourself and see what I mean. If you're a thrash fan, you will not be disappointed.

The album is in v0 .mp3 format; that's variable bitrate at ~245kbps.
