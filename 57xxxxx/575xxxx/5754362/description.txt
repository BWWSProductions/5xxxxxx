Identity 2010 [6 Part Miniseries] Complete (Xvid/MP3)

The Identity Unit lead by DSI Martha Lawson, the founder of the unit, specialises in cases concerning identity fraud by outsmarting, hunting down and unmasking the modern day Jekyll and Hydes.
Martha takes a risk in employing DI John Bloom, an SO-10 officer who has just spent fifteen years undercover. He knows first hand what it's like to pretend to be someone you are not. He's also only too aware of how easy it is to lose your own identity when you've lived a lie for the previous 15 years as a Dublin money launderer and bagman for the Turkish mafia and the past will not go away.
Completing the team are Tessa Stein, IT expert in everything from trawling databases to cracking security codes, DS Anthony Wareing who has his eye on promotion and a stance on cases that can err on the self-righteous, and DC Jose Rodriguez cocky, self-assured yet with a seriousness and sensitivity that gives him insight into cases.
As the series unfolds, DS Wareing becomes more and more concerned about Bloom's methods and frustrated by what he sees as Martha's blind and foolish indulgence of him.
