By the way, not sure if anyone else is with me on this, but another game I'd love to try before I buy would be the original Rainbow Six from GoG.com. If you have it, that is. =P"

,Hubology,2010-10-25T06:01Z,"Thanks dANGER_boy. Bought I-War and the expansions when they first came out (back when you could buy games and they would be finished and almost bug-free). 

If it works I might shell out the 6 more dollars for win7x64 compatibility. We'll see :)"
