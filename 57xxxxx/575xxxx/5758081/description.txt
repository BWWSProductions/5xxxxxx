Guest stars David Hartman, Lloyd Nolan, and Diana Muldaur.

This light, bland episode has Hartman in a mild-mannered 
role as George Foster -- a bank teller who pretends to be 
sheriff of Medicine Bow to impress his visiting father.

He wasn't really much of an actor, yet the producers
felt otherwise. David Hartman returned to this show in 
the regular role of Shiloh ranch hand David Sutton during
the following 1968-1969 season.

Eventually he gave up acting after his "Lucas Tanner"
series was cancelled in 1975.  Then he finally found
success on TV being himself -- a co-host on 
"Good Morning America" for many years.
