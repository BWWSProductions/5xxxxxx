Description: 
Coast ventures to new territory, the storm-battered Atlantic 
shore of Ireland's majestic northwest coast.Just five 
months before President John F Kennedy was 
assassinated in Dallas, he was riding in an open top limo 
through the crowded streets of Galway. Neil Oliver meets 
a photographer who covered JFK's motorcade on one of 
his first assignments and hears how this junior pressman 
managed to get up close and personal with the President 
and talk him into the perfect snap.Neil also discovers how 
the infamous 16th century 'pirate queen' Grace O'Malley 
turned her coastal home into an impregnable fortress.
At Clifden, Dick Strawbridge leads a team of radio experts 
who try to recreate the 100-year-old technology that 
Marconi developed to send the first commercial wireless
 messages across the Atlantic, using steam generators 
powered by peat and a massive antenna, over half a mile 
long.Miranda Krestovnikoff explores an odd little island 
where the mountain hare population is thriving; normally 
the animals are found high in the hills, so why are these 
hares happy eating seaweed on the shore?
Alice Roberts unearths the remarkable remains of the 
oldest farm in the British Isles, a complex system of walls 
and houses laid out before Stonehenge. The ancient 
ruins of these Stone Age farmers were buried in the peat 
for over 5000 years.
Local legend says that Clew Bay has 365 islands, one 
for each day of the year. Nick Crane investigates how this 
astonishingly beautiful and unusual landscape was 
created when Ireland was covered in ice.
