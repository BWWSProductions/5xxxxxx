""They should only allow English speaking movies on The Pirate Bay! ""

you do know that this website isn't based out of America right? I'm pretty sure TPB is based out of Sweden.  So maybe they should only allow Swedish movies. Just following your logic.

@Crawman
""And since English is pretty much the universal language it would have been nice to at least have a English subs included""
I would venture a guess that more people speak chinese, russian and spanish than you think.  Dont believe me? look up how many states in america label their official language as ""shared"".  many states have english and spanish as their official language.

It's a bullshit statistic because only 10% of your mandarin speaking retards own a television or computer, whereas 95% of English speakers own both.  That would put your Mandarin speaking pillow-stuffers on the bottom of the movie watching list.

English speakers own the industry and pump out English speaking titles not just because English is the primary language for business and the UN, but because English is the primary language for the bulk of the wealthy, connected, educated and therefore marketable masses for any form of media. Enlgish English English.

Not that im hating on you just saying..thats why you feel its dominant... and English is the ""Universal Language"" as in more countries speak English, than Mandarin.. Ok?

I do agree with the fact that it isn't a Hollywood movie, it was created in Indonesia and hence they can use which language they deem fit."

If you happen to travel as extensively as I have my job has taken me to nearly every European nation and currently all over Asia (currently in Thailand) and guess WHAT while in every country I have been too all the foreigners communicated to the locals by ENGLISH (not Chinese. Russian or Spanish)..

Hell just today here in Thailand I have seen a German man try to talk to a Chinese vendor in ENGLISH.. and Chinese tourist talking to Thai vendors in guess what (English).. so you can venture to guess whatever you like.. I did not say most people spoke English since China is the highest population and or Indian being 2nd..

But I can GUARANTEE you if you put a Chinese and a Indian together int he same room they would try and communicate to each other by ENGLISH..

Try not taking the Internet so seriously.

Oh, and to all the rednecks in here: it's a movie made in another country; try having some patience if you want English subs. Whether you think English is dominant or not doesn't preclude you from knowing what patience is. It's universal.

A movie needs a plot, otherwise I'd just go watch porn. There's no point doing a half-assed job! It just floods the net with dogshit that nobody wants. For instance, I've downloaded the same goddamn subs named 3 different things from 3 different sources. 

Get it right or get the fuck out. Nobody wants to READ broken English! And even based on what I saw, I bet I could just guess and do a far better job than the subs listed here.
