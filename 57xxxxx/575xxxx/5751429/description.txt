Summary


The film looks at the end of the 40s on the island of Ikaria. When the civil war ends, a small guerrilla group interprets the decision "despite the weapon foot" of the party line in its own way, giving rise to an adventure that will expire after six years. H lives of the rebels, but the routine and critical situations, solidarity and the contrast between their relationship with the island's population and a culture that retains the power to voluntarily work beyond the requirements of power and political balances of the times, make up the time of the film, which seeks to recreate a moment from the modern Greek history, which could be described as marginal for the consolidation of institutions and situations in the coming decades.
