The music video for MC Lars' "Twenty-Three".
.m4v format
The song is a sedately-paced impactful memorial to a roommate/friend of Lars' who committed suicide at the title age; Lars seems to have meant that both in memorial and as an alert to others.
The video features Lars amongst pictures of sent in by other people who lost friends and relatives in a similar manner.
