In the not too distant future a secret government re-animation chemo-virus gets released 
into conservative Sartre, Nebraska and lands in an underground strip club. As the virus 
begins to spread, turning the strippers into "Super Zombie Strippers" the girls struggle 
with whether or not to conform to the new "fad" even if it means there's no turning back.
