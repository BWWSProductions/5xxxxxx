[color=yellow]NOTES:[/color]

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Dinner For Schmucks

Ok first thanks to Hogs for the source files......
Sorry this took so long but,with one thing and another this got pushed further back.....
Anyway source video was ok for a cam but had alot of movement through out,not as bad as that inception cam :P
also the colours seemed too powerful,yet the contrast levels and brightness were way off and change throughout 
the film.
Audio wise the source was total crap....alot of hiss,hum and noise aswell as being really quiet and not stereo.
Work done .....well for the video first we cut alot of the movement out and resized the files to match each other...then we changed
the chroma,brightness,contrast,rgb colours and also used a smoother and sharpen filters.
The audio we totally reworked in goldwave making it stereo and then we increased the vocals,lowered the mid and used a reduce hum 
filter to clean it up some.....but in all honesty even after all that the audi ain't great but it's alot better than before so ;-)

Anyway enjoy :)
