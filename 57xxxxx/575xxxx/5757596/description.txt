Over the past few years, another TPB'er by the handle 'thegreenfrog' has generously uploaded gigs and gigs of AW material. I've downloaded every one of his torrents and am still in an ongoing process of sorting through them for those special models and sets that really trip my trigger. These sets won't intrigue everyone... some are a bit chubby for 'Hollywood' tastes. Some might not have the most stereotypically and/or classically beautiful faces. But they all have 'that something' that makes me like their sets. So I thought I would share them. I'm not sure how many there'll end up being, but I'm sorting from Z through A and am only on the letter L and I've only kept about 90 sets out of several hundred.

 So... all thanks for these goes to thegreenfrog. Please seed after downloading. Thanks to all the other generous uploaders that make TPB work.
