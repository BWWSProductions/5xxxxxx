,Kotryna3,2010-08-15T03:12Z,What is unpartitioned space in my life? Itâs mean my computer have only C partition with program files. Itâs new conception. Several partition in my computer is old school mental image. I am working only with external hard disc drives. Because works and information in my external HDD is my property and trash as well as. Which there is no point in polluting the computer HDD.
