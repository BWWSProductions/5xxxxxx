10.6 was the last version that was good.
Hiren's BootCD are trying to go legal.
Software like Acronis Disk Director, Acronis True Image, GetDataBack for FAT/NTFS, HDD Regenerator, Norton Ghost, Paragon Partition Manager+++ are removed!"

Yes. If folks really need this software, then consider hanging on to v10.6. But, give 11.x versions a try."
