 Release Name----- The.Glades.S01E05.PROPER.HDTV.XviD-2HD
 Release Date----- 08/09/2010
 Release Size----- 350Mb
 Source----------- HDTV
 Play Time-------- 00:42:44
 Resolution------- 624x352
 Frame Rate------- 23.98

 LONG:
 Where to start. FAILMERSE's XviD wing botched this good. Although the headers for the file
 read as 624x352 the video contained within is actually 1276x716. This is over the allowed
 limit. Also the file opens as an entire file of black frames in VDub, opens up as 1276x716
 in VLC, MPC tries to open it up at 624x352 before resizing the window.  This proves that the file 
 header information is incorrect and the resulting file is barely within playable parameters. 
 My guess is depending on codecs, this file may fail to play at all for some people. 

 I guess FAILMERSE is not content to just ruin x264 for people but also XviD. Where oh where is
 FQM and NoTV and the other reliable and speedy cable cappers when you need them?.


 SHORT:
 Bad resolution and damaged XviD headers.

            Think you have what it takes to be a part of 2X?
