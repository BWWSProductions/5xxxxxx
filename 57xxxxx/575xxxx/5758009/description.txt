Web Builder 6.x is a WYSIWYG (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get)
program used to create web pages. WYSIWYG means that the
finished page will display exactly the way it was designed.
The program generates HTML (HyperText Markup Language) tags
while you point and click on desired functions you can
create a web page without learning HTML. Just drag and drop
objects to the page position them 'anywhere' you want and
when you're finished publish it to your web server (using
the build in Publish tool). Web Builder gives you full
control over the content and layout of your web page.
