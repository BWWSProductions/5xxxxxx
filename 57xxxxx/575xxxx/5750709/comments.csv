,istrahd,2011-03-01T19:59Z,"Thanks for the Upload!  Will keep it on the seedbox with my other DC Universe Movies indefinitely!

Anyone having trouble playing these .mkv movies should try the VLC Player, which is FREE for downlaoad at:

or to download codecs for most other players you can go to:

http://www.matroska.org/technical/guides/playback/windows/index.html

It has a lot of detailed info on the file format, codecs, players, etc.

Thanks, again, for a great upload!"
