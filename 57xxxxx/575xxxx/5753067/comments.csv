I was hoping we could continue finishing our Zatoici series on YT.
Only 21, 25 and 26 are missing, got 22-24 ready for upload, only need to sync the subs.
Ofcourse i will be seeding them, when my job is over (end of august) i can seed permanently.
I hope we can find time to reseed them, thanks in advance."
