Daniel and Revelation are very clear that it is the Papacy it's lineage of popes. For example, the Bible says he will rule for 1260 years, change the ""times and laws"" (as related to the Ten Commandments), persecute God's commandment-keeping children, and ""come out of"" the fourth Beast (Read Daniel 7), which is Pagan Rome. And these are just a few of the characteristics that God gives us as identifiers of this power. Unless Obama can fulfill ALL these and about 25 more, then, no, he is not the Antichrist. For reason or another, I just can't see Obama living for 1260 years. But guess what? The Papacy did exactly that. They ruled from 538-1798 during the Dark Ages and did just that. In 1708 the Pope was taken captive by Napoleon's General (Berthier) and taken to Valence, France where he died in captivity. This ended their 1260 year reign. The Bible said that the beast would received a â€œDeadly wound,â€ which would eventually heal. In 1929, Mussolini returned full power to the Papacy with the Lateran Treaty. The ""deadly wound was healed."" Subtract 1798 from 538 and see what you get: 1260! God was that specific! That is the God I serve. He said, â€œI am God, declaring the end from the beginning.â€"
