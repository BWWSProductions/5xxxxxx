  From naxosaudiobooks.com:
Released to coincide with the two-hundredth anniversary of the authorâ€™s birth in January 1809, this selection of well-loved chilling tales from the master of the supernatural is a perfect Christmas gift. The short stories include The Murders in the Rue Morgue, The Pit and the Pendulum, The Tell-Tale Heart, The Masque of the Red Death, and The Fall of the House of Usher. This release also features additional poetry by Poe and a new biography especially written for Naxos AudioBooks by Roy McMillan.

This collection of 8 short stories, 23 poems, and a short biography of Poe is narrated by three readers: John Chancer, William Roberts, and Kerry Shale. 
Shale begins with â€œThe Murders in the Rue Morgue.â€ He employs a high-pitched French accent to represent Dupin and affects a surprised, somewhat immature tone for the narrator. Some of Poeâ€™s endless descriptions bog down the pacing. Listeners may want to head right to â€œThe Pit and the Pendulum,â€ read by Roberts, who is a master of the verbal adrenaline rush. His tones lower as the pendulum descends and speed up to match the petrified shrieks. 
Shale recites the poetry selections; cue up to â€œLenoreâ€ and zip over to â€œThe Ravenâ€ to experience a perfect audible pairing of love lost and unmitigated grief. Chancer provides a simple yet engaging reading of Poeâ€™s biography. 

Suitably macabre mood music marks transitions between the selections. The celebration of Poeâ€™s 200th birthday brings renewed 

interest in the authorâ€™s works.
