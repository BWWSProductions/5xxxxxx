A decade into his post-Roses career, Ian Brown has recruited a heavyweight coalition of the willing for his fifth studio album. Sinead Oâ€™Connor, fellow Manc legends Andy Rourke and Paul Ryder, plus ex-Pistols Steve Cook and Paul Jones all make guest appearances. Manchesterâ€™s answer to Bob Marley even invited Paul McCartney to join his rock-god love-in, but it seems the former Beatle declined. Doh! Some people.

Less impressive, alas, are the lyrical platitudes and flat-footed arrangements which pepper 'The World Is Yours'. After flirting with electro beats, cosmic funk and millennial reggae on previous albums, Brown settles for a fairly conservative mix of choppy guitars and programmed strings here. Strident midtempo rockers dominate, but melodic grace and lyrical epiphanies are in short supply.

Brown has always aspired to sage-like profundity and quasi-Biblical import, but generally filtered through an intoxicating fog of stoner mysticism. Here he pushes the Yoda-like proclamations to the point of banal self-parody: one law for the rich and another for the poor, you get what you give, homeless kids just need love - and so on, 'ad infinitum'.

On the apocalyptic â€œSave Usâ€ he admonishes â€œthose whose eyes are closed to the plight of the African childâ€. On â€œIllegal Attacksâ€, he and Sinead condemn the â€œcommercial crusadesâ€ in Iraq and Afghanistan with images of weeping mothers. Worthy and sincere sentiments, no doubt, but so baldly expressed they could be Phil Collins lyrics.

Fortunately, for all his Christ-like posturing, Brown remains better at menace and malevolence than messianic empathy. On â€œSister Roseâ€, with feverish funk-rock backing from Cook and Jones, he summons a vengeful feminist goddess. On â€œSome Folks Are Hollowâ€, he skewers church hypocrisy with exhilarating spite. Likewise â€œGoodbye To The Brokenâ€, where he emphatically severs ties with an ex-lover (or possibly former band mate?) over lush, weeping strings. More memorable for famous guests than fine tunes, 'The World Is Yours' does not diminish Brownâ€™s reputation, but it lacks the exotic, adventurous reach of his best
work. Hobbled by half-realised potential, Britrockâ€™s would-be saviour remains a rough beast, slouching towards Bethlehem to be born.
