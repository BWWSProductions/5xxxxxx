,Metalprofi666,2010-08-14T15:59Z,"one more question
how can i be banned when im not connected to the internet?"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-08-14T18:38Z,"My My guess is that you have new IX LT and this FW dont read waves so...yes.

You cant be banned if you are not conected to internet. But there is some ppl saying that XBox have some storge for last played games etc...and when you do connect to internet it will send the info to M$. I cant say if its true or not and none can. But i post the warning in case of what i heard. Its up to you to do what you want with the info. :D. My guess is also that change wave of games is a very easy way to make M$ ban console easy. My friend not long ago just changed(modded) colors on cars (GTA IV) and he got banned...."
,Metalprofi666,2010-08-14T23:52Z,"so,if i do get banned,what then? i cannot play dloadable games?"
