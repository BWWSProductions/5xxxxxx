Millions of people throughout the world are fascinated by puzzles, conundrums, and brain teasers. These amusing twisters from Barry Clarke are based on his extensive experience writing for the Daily Telegraph, Sunday Times and New Scientist. The author has gathered together a variety of posers including several examples of a brand new type of puzzle, The Word Bandit. Hints and full solutions are included for all puzzles. Wittily written and illustrated with delightful cartoons by the author, there is something for everyone here: puzzles for children, for the family, for members of Mensa, but above all puzzles for pleasure.

"...a lot of problem-solving puzzles in it [that are] hard yet fun..." Andrew Wood, American Scientist
