I am not sure what led me to buy this CD, but this is a nice, if not exceptional, collection of gentle and well put together tracks. Mainly acoustic and featuring a lot of good harmonic singing. This album does not enjoy a great deal of my attention, but it's nice music with a kind of sunday morning mood about it. 

Key Tracks: Full Of Stars.
                   Pain Killer.
