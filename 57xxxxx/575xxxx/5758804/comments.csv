,Celtic_Dragons,2012-03-13T02:32Z,"THANK YOU, zibbik, for such a great torrent. For a studio album discography, it is awesome.
You are missing a few albums to make it a COMPLETE discography:
Dream, After Dream (Soundtrack)
In the Beginning
Captured (Live)
Greatest Hits
The Ballade
Time
Greatest Hits (Live)
The Essential
Red 13 (EP)
Other than that, it is awesome!!!"
