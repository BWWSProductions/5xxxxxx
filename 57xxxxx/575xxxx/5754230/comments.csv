,btpirate6,2010-08-11T09:07Z,"This place is going to shit.  

No input file specified. 

I know about the magnet link, that's not my point.  This ship just seems to be slowly sinking if you ask me."
,LittleFang,2010-08-11T11:19Z,"Well, I didn't know about magnet link so thanks for the tip, mjpaps and ryancode00 - at least it works! (Gotta get my Louie fix, after all.)

It seems weird that I only get the 'file input not specified' thing on eztv torrents and not other ones.. does anyone know why this is happening??"
