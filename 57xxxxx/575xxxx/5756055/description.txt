In my journey through Atheism and, more importantly, Skepticism, I've found myself in a state of constant flux. More recently, I've come to realize that even my position of Atheism is really nothing more than a side-effect of my Skepticism. Furthermore, and in this same vein, I've realized that any position which I arrive at will ultimately be a result of my Skeptical mindset.

In coming to this realization, I've had to acknowledge the fact that no matter what conclusions I arrive at, I must abandon any inclinations I have toward certainty. And before I get too much into this idea of certainty, I should probably do a bit of explaining.
