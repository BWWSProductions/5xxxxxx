Four college students looking for a cheap place to live have found what looks to be a dream deal: in exchange for renovating a broken-down old mansion, they will not only get paid for their work, but will also get to live there rent-free. They naturally accept the offer, and quickly move in and get to work. Not so long afterwards, however, strange things start happening to all of them, and it soon becomes clear that they are not alone inside the eerie house.
