,P_B_D,2010-12-02T03:01Z,"I set up a profile just so I could comment on this torrent.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD.  The audio and video don't sync up.

A/3
V/3

Trust me when I say that downloading this torrent is a waste of time."
,flynndownunder,2011-01-01T03:31Z,"I agree with P_B_D 2010-12-2 03:01. ""DSIN"" 17:02 and ""kanha"" 20:44 are obviously playing this little game with ""gunnersrock"" 17:47. Anyway, 1280 x 720 resolution and a file size of 662 MB just doesn't add up. Stay well away from this one your time is better spent elsewhere."
,flynndownunder,2011-01-01T06:35Z,"Ok... so it's time to eat my words. This is a MKV file. Plays PERFECT on VLC Media Player! So, so sorry guys I jumped in too early I should have figured it out. I went into ""gunnersrock"" site and downloaded another movie. Again, PERFECT. Keep up the good work ""gunnersrock"" and keep 'em coming in 2011."

,rocky619,2011-06-01T05:52Z,thanks!! may be size would have been a little less!! 
,buleaaah,2011-07-03T16:01Z,@P_B_D it's your pc not the file
,apphakr,2011-09-05T14:43Z,I got this movie off another guy but it had subs. So this is my 2nd try.  thx
