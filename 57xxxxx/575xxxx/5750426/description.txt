Digital Ash in a Digital Urn was co-released with Im Wide Awake Its Morning in 2005.  While the latter disc is based around acoustic guitar and confessional songwriting the former shows the flip side of Conor Obersts personality.  The songs are darker, more observational and offer a critique of the banal superficiality inherent in modern capitalism.  The sparse electronic production creates an eerie sense of distored perception that echos the lyrical themes.
