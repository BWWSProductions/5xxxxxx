,pjsmoke,2011-05-14T16:39Z,"Don't download unless you don't care about watching duplicate episodes [exactly the same and not different versions censored/uncensored etc].

I've counted 11-12 so far in only the first 4 ""volumes', and there is probably 30+ duplicates in this torrent.

Why even bother muxing together the same frigging episodes? Geez, this torrent would get pulled down on a private site."
,Hamada_MJ,2011-06-17T16:03Z,Thanks for the GREAT collection!
,soulmanice,2011-06-25T18:59Z,"Beware that this torrent contains edited versions of the episodes made in the 1940s and 50s. It's not the uploader's fault, they're like that on the DVDs. For the unedited, uncensored episodes, go here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5376566/Tom_and_Jerry_-_The_Complete_Uncensored_Hanna-Barbera_Classics"
,gutterbanger,2011-08-23T00:47Z,"Thank you,

This works great and my kids love it.
Thanks again, great quality as well."
,SD_rocks,2011-09-07T21:19Z,wow! cant believe the perfect torrent by the perfect uploader exists!
