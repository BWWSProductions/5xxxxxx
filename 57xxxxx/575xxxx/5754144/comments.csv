,dANGER_boy,2010-08-11T04:34Z,"Sorry for the fucked up torrent info.  TPB is being really lame on parsing right now.  I considered releasing this torrent on Demonoid or another site because TPB needs some fixing.  Oh well...at least the actual READ ME.txt looks OK.

Enjoy!"
,AceofSpades1412,2010-08-11T10:24Z,You are a lifesaver dANGER_boy.Thanks again!
,GCor71,2010-08-11T13:27Z,Thanks you uploader. Just played it and worked great. Thanks again.
,sauriva,2010-08-11T16:20Z,"Thanks, great job!
But I've got some problems after istalling and decrypting all of this. Suddenly the game began to ask for a cd, but it did run without any! When I try to lounch it manually I get an error that fmod_event.dll was not found ("
,dANGER_boy,2010-08-11T18:04Z,"@sauriva
The only thing I can think of is that you updated to v1.04 but failed to reapply a No CD patch.  The update will override your .exe, so you need to get a new v1.04 No CD crack.  Check Gamecopyworld.com for a current one."

AWESOME torrent! Although I have a little problem ):

The installation is cool and all that, and so is the 5 - 10 min of gameplay before it screws up S:
Dunno why, but after i've killed the first mobs, and when i follow that dwarf ghost with Jerrik, i end up at the ""door to Amgarrak"". When i enter it, a little movie pops up, and after that the whole screen goes grey. Although the health bar, and skill bar and all that are still there.. i just cant see my chars, or anything else S:? "

...Yeah..."
,Eruza,2010-08-13T20:10Z,"This one installs fine for me but displays ""Missing Requirements"" in the DLC menu in-game. I'm patched to 1.04 (which runs fine with the Awakenings crack exe) and I have every other DLC installed except for Darkspawn. My AddIns.xml file is fine and I've run the decrypter. Any ideas?"

I've got the same problem too. I would be very grateful if someone offered a solution. Thank you!"
,dANGER_boy,2010-08-14T22:48Z,"Out of curiousity, what game region are y'all using and what No CD crack?"
,Eruza,2010-08-14T23:46Z,"@dANGER_boy 

I'm using the crack from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5435879/Dragon_Age_Origins_Awakening-Razor1911 but it's been marked ""Missing Requirements"" since before I installed Awakening and 1.04."
,Eruza,2010-08-14T23:47Z,"Sorry: US region, as far as I know."

Update using the v1.04 patch again, just to be sure, and then get a v1.04 No CD crack from Gamecopyworld.com"
,Peepeebedee,2010-08-16T05:28Z,"got a slight hitch, installed everything, change the xml's etc etc, tried to import my character, pressed play and said it couldn't load the area, re-installing all the DLc's now, just incase. any ideas ?"
,dANGER_boy,2010-08-16T22:40Z,"@Peepeebedee
This is a very anal addon.  I couldn't play it intially cause I kept getting put into a square room with no exits.  Turns out some of the other mods/addons were causing conflicts.  Try disabling mods until you get it to work.  Hopefully that is the problem."
,kopo007,2010-08-17T18:48Z,"Million thanks to you dANGER_boy:). It's working a charm after I change the addins encoding to utf 8.
Thx..,."
,T-Totaller,2010-08-19T04:13Z,"@dANGER_boy

after installing the 4 files, i got an error on the first 3 files. i even tried to check addins.xml and checked with the settings, and ran decrypter- all those failed. so i downloaded the DAO ModManager from the DA Nexus site and it found an error in my .xml file and repaired it. i tried again, and all 4 files were successfully installed this time- then ran the decrypter and edited the .xml entries.

the problem lies here: when i try to import a character from my origins OR awakening, the game crashes. yet when i try to make a new character, nothing bad happens. i'd really appreciate some help. thanks!"
,dANGER_boy,2010-08-20T00:19Z,"@T-Totaller
This sounds like an error with the mod itself and not the DAZIPs.  I did not test the DLC with an imported character, nor do I have one currently available to test with.  However, you might want to check the Bioware support forums at http://social.bioware.com and see if other users are experiencing the same problem."

how to do this?i mean change the encoding of the .xml file??"
,dANGER_boy,2010-08-21T05:43Z,"@osjjdb89
Open AddIns.xml in Notepad, go to File, Save As..., and change the encoding drop-down box to UTF-8.  Save in the same place, overwriting the original."
,ReMiNz,2010-08-21T12:24Z,"Hey dANGER_boy,
I have the same issue as T-Totaller..
The 1st 3 files had error and the last file was installed..
I did everything u said about AddIns.xml but the same error continues...
any suggestions? TY in advance"
,Banalityofevil,2010-08-21T20:20Z,"Hey man thanks for the torrent. I'm having the same issue as Peepeebedee. In that no matter what I've tried; enabling/disabling/reinstalling... 
I still get the ""unable to load area"" 
It's really frustrating anyone manage to tackle this?"

,aca92srb,2010-08-22T14:26Z,Guys I had a problem that first 3 files couldn't install so I changed the encoding to utf-8. And now only first file won't install. I am really confused right now so i downloaded dao modmanager but i dk how to repair .xml file. can smb pls explain it to me. TY
,Peepeebedee,2010-08-23T00:01Z,"@dANGER_boy

in the end i uninstalled everything and reinstalled after the 3rd time and then reinstalled the DLC's a bit more :P, the original problem was because i didn't click the correct decrypter file i think, but then i got other problems. 

reinstalling awakening and the DLC's several times fixed it though. remember to delete your addin's xml and manifest files in User/documents/bioware/dragonage/settings everytime you have a problem with installing them :).

hope i helped, and thanks alot for the upload, i've had alot of fun with these DLC's "
,ratchet5,2010-08-25T03:25Z,"I finished this campaign without a problem earning all the achievements, but however I could not transfer the items to my normal campaign because you have to log in confirming that you bought this DLC. Anyone have a crack for this or a way around it?"
,ratchet5,2010-08-25T04:53Z,"Actually, adding on to what I said earlier, I changed the requires authorization for the item packs to 0 and it now says enabled. But I still didnt get the items although i completed all three achievements for Amgarrak."
,ratchet5,2010-08-25T05:33Z,"I think its this file or its unpacked contents that dont get decrypted (DAO_PRC_GIB_O_1.0.dazip), so we cant access the item rewards for getting the achievements."
,dANGER_boy,2010-08-25T06:20Z,"@ratchet5
This file is called an Offer file and does not need decryption.  It is a set of files that help the game engine communicate with the DLC.  The files that pertain to the weapons are DAO_PRC_GIB_DAO and DAO_PRC_GIB_EP1, which get properly decrypted.  I need more people to confirm that they cannot get the weapons rather than just one case."
,Josjes,2010-08-28T18:45Z,"@Banalityofevil Have you tried using the DLC encrypter? I had the ''Unable to load area'' problem as well before I used the Encrypter. Works perfectly fine now, thanks Danger_boy! :D
