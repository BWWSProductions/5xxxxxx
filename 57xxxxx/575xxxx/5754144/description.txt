This torrent is the newest piece of downloadable content for Bioware's epic RPG Dragon Age: Origins, titled Golems of 

Amgarrak, released 10 August 2010.

It is a standalone module that also comes with a unique item for use in the original game and its expansion, 

Awakening.  You can either import a previous DAO character or start a new one for this mini-campaign.

-=-=Installation=-=-

1. If not already, update your game to v1.04.  You can find the patch easily on the internet.  If needed, apply a 

v1.04 No CD patch.
2. Locate and run daupdater.exe in the "bin_ship" folder where you installed the game.
3. Click "Select DAZIPs" and select all 4 DAZIP files in this torrent.
4. Highlight all the files in the list and click "Install Selected"
5. Upon completion, run decrypt_all.bat from the "DLC Decrypter" folder of this torrent.
6. Locate AddIns.xml in "C:/Users/(Username)/Documents/Bioware/Dragon Age/Settings" and edit it using WordPad or any 

XML editor. Replace all RequiresAuthorization="1" with RequiresAuthorization="0".
7. Run the game and check to see if everything worked!  Click "Other Campaigns" and the DLC should be visible and 

playable.

Cheers!

ATTENTION: If you are getting an error while installing the DLC, it is most likely caused by a corrupt AddIns.xml.  

Navigate to where it is located and delete both it AND Manifest.xml.  You will need to reinstall the Awakenings 

expansion (if you have it) and any previous DLC.  This should solve your problem.  A simpler way to do this without 

having to install everything again is to make sure the encoding of AddIns.xml is set to UTF-8 rather than deleting the 

two XMLs.

NOTE: The unique item can only be accessed after completing the mini-campaign and unlocking the relevant achievement.

NOTE: This version of the DLC Decrypter will ONLY decrypt this DLC.  It is not a generic decryption tool and must be 

modified to decrypt other DLC.
