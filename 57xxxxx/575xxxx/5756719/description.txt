 From Wiki:
Greg Hawkes is a musician best known as the keyboardist for the awesome Boston band: The Cars.

Greg started collecting Ukuleles and getting involved in the â€˜Ukeâ€™ scene in and around Boston. Gregâ€™s experimental nature led him to try duplicating Beatles string parts on Ukulele. 
Longtime friend, Elliot Easton of the Cars, heard his Uke recording of â€œEleanor Rigbyâ€ and suggested he send it to Dick Boak, Artist Relations, at The Martin Guitar Company for their â€œMy Favorite Martin Series.â€ Dick Boak loved it, and introduced him to James Jensen at Solid Air Records who suggested doing a whole CD of Beatles songs. 
Greg turned to friend and music producer Perry Geyer at Cybersound in Boston. Together, they produced 15 Beatles song instrumentals (over 45 minutes of music), using multi-tracked â€œUKEsymphonicâ€ recordings to create a Ukulele orchestra style.
