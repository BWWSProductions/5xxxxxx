Release Notes:
Ok....little late on this one, anyway re filtered the video, giving it a bit more contrast changing the colours around  abit
added sharpness and some other bits, used a deflicker filter also.... audio is Krackermans Thanks mate synced by imagine, 
imo this is easily watchable...do for the kids Enjoy

On another note, for those who asking us to do The Other Guys, we will not be doing it due to the video has several glitches
throughout, which is also on encodes, just not worth the bother
