,chucktg69,2010-08-11T07:14Z,Thanks for putting these up I love Alton.  I don't get the food network right now.  I was wondering if you do and if you could put up the Next Food Network Star if at all possible.  Thanks if you can.  No worries if you can't.

,vamosvaqueros,2010-09-20T02:40Z,"episode #s seem to be out of order (at least when compared to the wikipedia list)...includes the ""Twas the Night Before"" xmas special but is missing the ""Catfish will rise again"" episode...unless you love catfish, not a big deal....awesome"
