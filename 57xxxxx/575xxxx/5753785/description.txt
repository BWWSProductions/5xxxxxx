IMAGiNE NOTES
Right sources used was the cam video from Hogs and some new line audio off KrackerMan ... thanks to all ;-)
Workdone ... We took the and made a script to correct the white balance, brightness and contrast.
Then dropped that into vdub and used some more filters ...inc rgb eq, smoother, sharpen, hue, intes and a few more.
Now the audio was some pretty good LiNE audio, but needed to be cut and synced and then filtered some.
Once done it was a just case of muxing together and packing it up.

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
