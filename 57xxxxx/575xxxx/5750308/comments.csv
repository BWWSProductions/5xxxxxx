,Darkfall666,2010-08-11T13:08Z,"This rip is absolutely terrible! It unfocuses every 2 seconds all the way through the movie (seriously - every 2 seconds, like clock work).

I expect this'll get nuked, if it hasn't already.

Great movie, though."

,iamcims,2010-08-19T06:44Z,"whoever encoded this. does not know what they are doing.

wished i had got another copy since this is just bad. every time there is movement, there is a pixelation/blur that is annoying, distorting the picture.

it should be deleted imo."
