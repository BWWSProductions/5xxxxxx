,sanatkr,2010-08-10T20:51Z,hey!! no subtitle....
[V],MKVGuy,2010-08-10T21:04Z,"@ullas_uk, no, no more horrors, I liked the star cast that's it and it ain't that scary like others where you have Blood and violent scenes.. Also like Daybreakers(09) was fine for me, the picturesqueness were in that order that you can see those scenes if you don't like blood.. I really have a soft heart, haha.."
[V],MKVGuy,2010-08-10T21:16Z,"@sanatkr, this isn't that much scary, the subs are there, its in the video file itself, if you don't want them you can also disable them in any of the Media Player, I recommend VLC Player to play my rips.."
