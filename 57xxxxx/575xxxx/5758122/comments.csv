,Terugane,2010-08-14T02:16Z,"my bro and I got the game installed and everything is running great with the exception of 1 thing we can not use a controller with this game.The game will not use a 360/pc joy it only wants you to use a keyboard if anyone knows how to get a PC controller to work on this game please share that info.
me will love you long time =P"
,Blackiris09,2010-08-14T10:09Z,"@Terugane
If you cannot use a gamepad in-game, then the solution is quite simple tbh.
Download the newest version of Xpadder (5.3, I guess) and bind gamepad's buttons to keyboard's keys. Works perfectly for me."
,Acaaab,2010-08-14T13:29Z,Game crashes few seconds after starting. Does anybody know what may cause that?
,FROMHEAV,2010-08-14T14:24Z,Thanks for the torrent. But the serial in the description works only while installing but when the game starts it doesn't work and without it the game can't be saved. 
,derpaherpa,2010-08-14T15:45Z,"Thanks for the upload, it works flawlessly for me.

The only thing I'm having problems with is setting it up for 2-player mode using two Keyboards.

I can't even get find a key setup for player 2, only re-assigning for the gamepad buttons.

Anyone knows how to configure it to use Keyboard input for both players, or simply where I can setup keys for player 2."
,elven-archer,2010-08-14T18:38Z,"@ Terugane 
You can buy a USB joystick. They are not at all expensive. All games of this genre that I know of are compatible with USB joysticks."
,schokoxx,2010-08-14T22:50Z,"does this one work with games for windows live? i mean i could use the achievement points :)

glad if you respond"
,FROMHEAV,2010-08-15T15:30Z,"@godofwrath
It's a problem on your end, because I have Windows 7 x64 aswell. Besides the fact that I can't save without a proper serial and a glitchy background in story mode, the game runs without  problems."
,Dirkbad,2010-08-15T18:10Z,"Got the same problem... just like Godofwrath. The install program keeps telling me that the media cab files are corrupted (either media1.cab, media2 or media3 or 4). Can't manage to find out what's wrong and it's pretty annoying given the fact that my computer is brand new. "
,Dirkbad,2010-08-15T18:21Z,"Got the same problem here... just like Godofwrath. The install program keeps telling me that the media cab files are corrupted (either media1.cab, media2, 3 or 4). Can't manage to find out what's wrong and it's pretty annoying with a brand new computer. ^^"
,XxShadexX,2010-08-16T04:33Z,"I'm having the same problem as FROMHEAV.
This is kind of a big issue, so I'd really like to know a solution if possible."
,randomx1,2010-08-19T05:07Z,Anyone having an issue where only the background music is present and the game doesn't have the voices or sound effects? It's a nice game and all but it's really annoying to be lacking this aspect of it.
,Kamacaztiege,2010-08-19T11:42Z,oh for god sake guys seed more please?
,LordStefan0,2010-08-20T15:20Z,you need to have service pack 3 or higher to install
,evol-23,2010-08-21T05:01Z,Seed Please :) im soooooo close but am only goin 20kbps :( halp meh plz
,seraphimax,2010-08-21T17:20Z,works great on win7 home basic 32-bit thanks
,goal563,2010-08-23T07:12Z,"Getting past the Windows Live thing is easy.
All you do is select ""Create a profile"" when the menu appears, then scroll down and select ""Create local profile"".

Once you're done, the game will prompt you to make a save file."
,goal563,2010-08-23T07:13Z,good game by the way ... better than SFIV. 
,Lionheartx2,2010-08-26T00:39Z,is there any way to play this online?
,dlxro,2010-08-30T02:04Z,"I have a question, do you know why graphics look pixeled even when I have AA x4. I have 60 fps, but character graphics are pixeled.

is simple, the AA is only for 3d objects, if u look at your bg is smooth :)"
,NewmanKid,2010-09-13T22:21Z,"I copied the cracked stuff into the install file but anytime I run it, I get the message ""failed to initialize"""
,STrisic,2010-09-18T10:37Z,Same prob like Acaaab or similiar when i push START game closes and says Don't send and send
,popitetsuo,2010-09-22T22:09Z,This same Acaaab and STrisic. On other copy of win 7  32bit works on win 64bit no i dont know why.
,Brainsnack,2010-09-27T04:42Z,Works perfectly with an usb controller. I'm using a 360 one. Thx!
,genodo,2010-09-28T16:22Z,"im having troubles running the game, every time i click on the crack or the launcher i keep getting ""the ordinal 5310 could not be located in the dynamic link library xlive.dll"""

,scum666,2010-10-03T05:28Z,What a stunner of a game.
,recon39er,2010-11-07T14:35Z,"INSTALLED THE GAME.

PLAYED IT.

BUT COULD ONLY PLAY THE GAME WITHOUT SAVE.


WINDOWS LIVE IS ASKING ME FOR SERIAL NUMBER.


IT DOESN'T ACCEPT 00000-00000-00000-00000-00000!!!



HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,recon39er,2010-11-07T14:40Z,"
To PROPERLY run the game...



Don't click the BBCT or anything else.


Click BBCTSTART, the cracked one.

It will give a cmd, then start the game.

It will not give the ""FAILED TO INITIALIZE"" message."
,solopy567,2010-11-24T20:12Z,"My game crashes after I press start!

I believe a video is trying to load up but it doesn't work!

I need help!"
,gellis2010,2010-12-27T16:55Z,"im getting the failed to initizialed message. even if i run the crack with admin.

Anyone know what it is yet? I downloaded latest directx and updated codecs incase it was struggling to run the intro movie.
Cant figure out what this is."
,SuperPea,2010-12-28T05:18Z,"@gellis2010: I also had this problem. I downloaded this torrent months ago. Was playing flawlessly. Then yesterday it suddenly said ""Failed to initialize"". 
I removed the game. Reinstalled it. The problem still persisted. 
Then I use the repair option in the control panel, but the error was still there (even if I started the game with BBCTSTART)
Guess what? I gave it a try tonight with the   BBCTSTART and BAM!!! It worked! Now im playing.
I dont know what caused this, and im even more curious of what fixed it, bcuz i didnt do anything.
Just wanted to tell you that i had this problem too."
,SuperPea,2010-12-28T05:21Z,"oh i forgot. I think the error has something to do with the DLL file ole33.dll. Before cracking the game, i had another error but after copying the cracking content which contains the dll file, i got ""Failed to initialize"". "
,SuperPea,2010-12-28T05:25Z,"Ugh. Dont know why my comments got deleted. But I had this ""Failed to initialize"" problem too.
Was playing with no problem, then one day it popped up. The error has something to do with the ole33.dll file i think."
,SuperPea,2010-12-28T05:26Z,ah sod it... it must be my connection
,d3ad4ng3l,2011-01-21T02:04Z,"For all those are getting ""FAILED TO INITIALIZE"", you need to bypass the anti virus, for example, if you are using kaspersky, add the game to truested, then you will be able to play the game."
,darksuccubus,2011-01-23T00:42Z,I launch BBCTSTART and cmd opens for a few seconds but then it closes and the games doesn't even load T_T what should I do?

,lilkidz,2011-05-25T18:08Z,"For those having problems running the game, extract everything from the .iso file onto your hard drive and install using BLAZBLUEAutoRun.exe. It will ask for a serial key; input 00000-00000-00000-00000-00000 and it will install. 

Next step is to copy the files from the crack folder that was extracted as above. Paste them into C:\Program Files (x86)\ARC SYSTEM WORKS\BLAZBLUE -CALAMITY TRIGGER-\ This is where everything is located. If you want, backup the BBCTStart.exe and paste ole33.DLL AND BBCTStart.exe HERE.

Next up is creating a local profile. Open the crack file BBCTStart.exe and it should open a command line window and the game will eventually open. 

When you press A or so, you should get a dropdown window about creating a profile. Click Create Profile and then SCROLL down the text and you will see Create a Local Profile; this is so you do not need to input a serial key to play.

And pass that is straight forward, I believe.

Enjoy!"
,dothackjhe,2011-06-04T02:39Z,"The game works, but causes screen dislocation once the game is not closed properly (don't use the alt+F4 hotkey). At least it happened on a 1024x768 default resolution outside of the game. The dislocation of the screen can be remedied though -- just run the game again and this time exit the game properly and it'll be fixed. "
,Jetstorm78,2011-06-16T10:39Z,"I have a little problem with this game. the game works fine in my PC. the problem is the background music in stroy mode dosen't play.

,takeaimnfire,2011-09-19T10:18Z,For everyone having problems getting their controller to work.  Launch the BBCT Launcher to select your controller after running the game with the crack first.
