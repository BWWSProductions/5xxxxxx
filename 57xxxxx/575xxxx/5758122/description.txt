BlazBlue is a new experience in 2D weapons based fighting making exceptional
use of the Hi Res power behind the Next Gen consoles. The game is created
by Arc System Works (Japanese developers of the Guilty Gear franchise).
The 3D one-on-one fighting stages and 2D Goth-Anime characters are pure
over-the-top Japanese. Fighters seamlessly combo from standard attacks into
specials using the four-button control scheme (weak, medium and strong
attacks). Every character also has a unique special attack called a
Distortion Drive.
