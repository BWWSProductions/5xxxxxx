The Internet phenomenon The Guild comes to comics, courtesy of series creator, writer, and star Felicia Day (Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, Buffy The Vampire Slayer).  The Guild has become a cult hit and is the winner of numerous awards from SXSW,Yahoo, and the Streamys. 

The Guild chronicles the hilarious on-and offline lives of a group of Internet role-playing gamers, the Knights of Good. In this origin tale of the Knights of Good, we learn about Cyd's life before joining the guild, how she became Codex, and how she began to meet the other players who would eventually become her teammates. This storyline fills in details never before revealed on the web show, making it a delightful new chapter for existing fans as well as a perfect jumping-on point for new fans!
