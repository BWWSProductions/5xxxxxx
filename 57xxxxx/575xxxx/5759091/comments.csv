,blairbug1,2012-04-17T02:57Z,I can't get any episodes to work for me. I downloaded the torrent and I have no idea how to convert it so it will play. Opening it in the original Windows Movie Maker format doesn't work.

,ProphetZarquon,2012-05-07T03:50Z,"Excellent quality, regardless of size.
Subs work in VLC (Start playback, right click on video area, select Subtitles, select Track 01).
Subs did not work in Media Player Classic (CCCP) for some reason.

Anime compresses very well with certain codecs.  I usually prefer DivX avi, because of it's wide support by devices.  MP4 AVC can be problematic.  BUT:  Anime in MP4 AVC with Matroska encapsulation is made of win.

These files are TINY and you can barely see any hint of compression at all, even in detailed action scenes.

V:10 (9+1 for amazing size and no visible artifacts anywhere)
A:9 (Dynamic range is a bit wide, soft now, then loud, then soft.  GREAT quality and dual audio with either English dub or original Japanese dialog.

The sub translations are...  Different."
