,smacwhir,2010-08-17T08:15Z,"Maybe I just can't figure it out, but I have ZERO sound on mine."
,timekeeper,2010-08-17T18:28Z,"Great print both video & sound perfect 9.5/10, I agree with PirateGirl2 the only drawback being the two bars just below the top corners - then again it is a work print.

Thanx U/L - Keep on choolin'"
,bpongpro,2010-08-18T13:52Z,"pretty good copy for a WP... 



V=6 two blurred bars on top of screen, one on right and one on left. very watchable tho, barely noticed them after a few min.      A=5 kinda low         M=8 a little over top with the whole parody thing

thanks so much, had this movie before it even hit theaters lol"

,McfcDan,2010-08-22T07:03Z,"I'm very grateful for this torrent I truly am, it's taken me approximately 10 minutes to download this. I'm being serious this must be the quickest download I've ever encountered from torrents, thank you very very much."
,bus5000,2010-08-22T09:19Z,"A large portion of the screen has been cropped because of the ""property of new regency"" watermark on the bottom of the screen. Download this preview and the preview of other torrents and see which you prefer. I personally would rather see the whole screen and just ignore the watermark."
,Efilnikufecin,2010-08-23T02:31Z,"Many thanks to the upper... excellent speeds!!! and of course thanks to TPB for always providing quality torrents! Will seed at least 1:1 as usual... Thanks again!

,peewee-hermen,2010-09-22T19:51Z,"A=10/V=9/M=10,
i couldn't stop laughing, it was the funniest thing I've ever seen,  I gave it a nine on video because of the two blurs on the right and the left corners throughout the movie. Otherwise the movie was awesome now to watch McGruber and see if all the rumors about its shittyness is true.
oh then when I played this on my friends PlayStation 3 the background music would be only thing I would be able to hear what I played on the Xbox 360 was able to hear both the voices and the background music so they plan to play it on the console see about trying to fix the audio problem with the PlayStation 3 otherwise use an Xbox 360."
,peewee-hermen,2010-09-22T19:53Z,the ending is the funniest thing I've ever seen makes me glad I never saw the actual twilight movies even though a lot of hot chicks went to see them.
