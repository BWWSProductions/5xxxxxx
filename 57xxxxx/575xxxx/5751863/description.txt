Update World of Warcraft:
From 3.3.3a (Version 3.3.3.11723) to 3.3.5a (3.3.5.12340)

Note: Please run World of Warcraft and check the bottom left corner of screen at login to verify that you are using 3.3.3.11723 or 3.3.5.12213. If you have something different you may not need this file.

Zip file containing the two Patch files needed to get your World of Warcraft game from 3.3.3a to 3.3.5a.

WoW-3.3.3.11723-to-3.3.5.12213-enUS-patch.exe

WoW-3.3.5.12213-to-3.3.5.12340-enUS-patch.exe

Directions:

1) Unzip the file "WoW-3.3.3.11723-3.3.5.12340-enUS-patch.zip" into your working "World of Warcraft" directory. 
For example:
"C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\"
"H:\My Games\World of Warcraft 3.3.5a\"
or whatever...

2) Double click, or run the file that matches the version you need to update. This should open the Blizzard Updater. When the updater is complete it should notify you of this below the progress bar. At this time click the Red "X" at the top right corner of the updater to close it. Do not let the launcher download. Close it if it opens. Run the next patch in the same manner if needed, closing the updater by clicking the "X" when the update is successful. 

*NOTE* Do Not Click the "OK" Button on the Updater. Be Sure to Close the Updater after each Patch or you may patch beyond the version you desire to stop at.


3) Don't forget to set your realmlist.wtf as desired.
For Example:

set realmlist privateserver.com

This can be done by right clicking on the file realmlist.wtf and selecting "Open With" Notepad or "Open" and choose Notepad as the file you wish to edit it with, set realmlist as needed and then save your changes.

4) Copy Wow.exe and "Paste Shortcut" to Desktop or wherever you want to run World of Warcraft! Do Not Use the Launcher or it will change your settings and update you past your desired version.

Note: you can have multiple World of Warcraft version folders, I have three. Two for two different private servers and one for Blizzard.
Just be careful to name the shortcuts correctly to keep track of your game.

I hope this helps.
