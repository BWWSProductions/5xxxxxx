Something terrible has happened to him . . . Artemis Fowl has become nice. The fairies diagnose Atlantis Complex â€“ thatâ€™s obsessive compulsive disorder to you and me â€“ dabbling in magic has damaged his mind. Fairy ally Captain Holly Short doesnâ€™t know what to do. Because the subterranean volcanoes are under attack from vicious robots and Artemis cannot fight them. Can Holly get the real Artemis back Â­Â­Â­before the robot probes destroy every human and life form?
