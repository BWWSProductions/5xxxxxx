Even before watching the video, i would like to thank you for putting in the effort in promoting this motor and distributing this video for those interested.

Only yesterday i finished reading a book on the rotary which i had trouble finding in the first place, and have to say, the rotary is simply an amazing internal combustion engine. I don't know how much of the history you know about it, but according to the book it was consistently challenged beyond fairness compared to piston engines... part of the reason why it is so unpopular today, on top of the fact that it was simply not developed as much as the piston engine.

For those interested i recommend reading this book, http://www.amazon.com/Wankel-Rotary-Engine-John-Hege/dp/0786429054/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1322751489&sr=8-2

Cheers,

And thanks again for the upload, looking forward to see what additional information you can teach me :) Hope to promote this engine in my future, when finances and time become available.
