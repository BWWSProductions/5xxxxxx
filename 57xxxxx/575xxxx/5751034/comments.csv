sorry for the xvid crowd, but im not sinking my night into trying to fix it 2 bad encodes was enough"
,livin52,2010-08-10T00:26Z,"Are you gonna make the XVID version?

Hope you do... Thanks."
,P2P-ftw,2010-08-10T01:05Z,"I wasn't going to up the xvid, but seems I got it fixed... expect it sometime tonight"
,yurune,2010-08-10T12:12Z,Thanks!  I tried that myupload.dk and I really like it!  Can you put the mp4s on there too?  That would be awesome.
