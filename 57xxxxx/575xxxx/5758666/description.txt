:: Review ::
This never-before-released recording of CamarÃ³n de la Isla is another gift for the singerâ€™s countless admirers. Just over fifty minutes of cante by JosÃ© Monje Cruz, a boy of less than 17 at the time, who was already called â€œCamarÃ³nâ€ by friends and family due to his fair skin and hair, registered on the tape recorder purchased by Juan Vargas in order to capture treasures of cante such as this.

Towards the end of the nineteen-sixties, the Venta de Vargas was a landmark â€“ from the end of the thirties the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of flamenco passed through. It was a veritable university of flamenco whose headmaster was called Manuel Ortega, Caracol.

That wondrous summer evening CamarÃ³n left recorded evidence of his surprising knowledge of cante, and the flamenco messages that for some reason were not circulated during his lifetime.

The first four cantes of the record were registered in the outdoors, in the very door of the inn from the counter that faced the kitchen. The sound is clear and transparent and captures, without any echo, the subtleties in CamarÃ³nâ€™s voice and guitar.

The second half, cantes six through ten, are another story. They are from a private fiesta in the backroom of the inn. The background noise and a certain excess of echo made cleaning and masterization difficult. The bulerÃ­as recall El Chozas and Pastora; the siguiriyas are of El Nitri, Terremoto and Pastora; the fandangos are Caracol and de la CalzÃ¡; the tarantos are ChacÃ³n and Manuel Torre and some Extremaduran tangos are clearly Porrinas and la Marelu.

As we lovingly peeled away the layers one by one, and discovered the heart of these cantes, some never-before-heard verses in CamarÃ³nâ€™s voice, and an immortal CamarÃ³n, we realized just what we had in our hands.
