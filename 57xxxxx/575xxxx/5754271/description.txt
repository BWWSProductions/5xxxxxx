Easy-to-use tools to speed up your PC
*************************************
Registry Mechanic offers easy-to-use optimization tools to speed up and improve 
the stability of your Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP PC.

Normal daily computer use, installing and uninstalling software, and surfing the 
Internet can cause corrupt registry entries that slow or even crash your PC. 
Regardless of your level of expertise, Registry Mechanic safely cleans, repairs, 
and optimizes the Windows registry and automatically backs up changes for future 
recovery.

Now includes Internet privacy options, secure file deletion, and hard disk 
bleaching tools to keep your personal information away from prying eyes.



Optimize your registry and speed up your PC!
********************************************
With Registry Mechanic you can safely clean, repair and optimize your Windows 
registry with a few simple mouse clicks! Problems with the Windows registry are 
a common cause of Windows crashes, slow performance and error messages. 
By regularly using a registry cleaner to fix registry errors your system will be 
faster, more stable and system performance will improve without expensive hardware 
upgrades. Learn more about the importance of a clean registry with registry 
insight.

Registry Mechanic uses a high-performance detection algorithm to quickly identify 
missing and invalid references in your Windows registry. Normal daily use, 
installing and uninstalling software, missing or corrupt hardware drivers, and 
surfing the Internet can corrupt registry entries â€“ slowing your PC down and even 
crashing it.

With a few easy steps, Registry Mechanic will scan your entire registry for any 
invalid entries in the Windows registry and provide a detailed list of all 
registry errors found. You can then choose to selectively clean each item or 
automatically repair them all. For your convenience and protection, Registry 
Mechanic makes a backup of any repairs made so that you can easily recover any 
changes if needed.

NEW! Protect your Internet privacy. Registry Mechanic helps to protect your 
Internet privacy by ensuring all traces of your online Internet and computer 
activities are permanently erased and unrecoverable on your PC. Information 
from every website you visit from your computer is stored and recorded in hidden 
Windows locations including temporary files, cookies, the system registry and the 
index.dat file. Web browsers only provide partial privacy protection by allowing 
some temporary Internet browsing files and cookies to be deleted, but they do not 
clean data out of all hidden files nor do they delete the history securely.

BONUS! Permanently delete files and bleach unused hard disk space. 
Registry Mechanic, now includes secure file shredding to keep all of your personal 
and sensitive data away from prying eyes. It also bleaches your free hard disk 
space for extra protection. Just because you emptied your Windows Recycle Bin does
not mean your documents and files are gone. Using simple recovery software, anyone 
can easily restore these previously â€œdeletedâ€ files. Registry Mechanic ensures 
that your deleted files stay deleted by bleaching your free hard disk space.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

This torrent is scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security 
2- Avira AntiVir Premium 
3- avast! Pro Antivirus
4- Kaspersky Antivirus

Also scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected 
by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!

To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
