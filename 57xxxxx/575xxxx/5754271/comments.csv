Nobody said that SysMech 10 doesn't exist, but only that your version is labelled wrong. Just take it easy, stop spamming, and ignore me. You'll have a nice time then ......"
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-08-11T16:35Z,"it seems that this is your problem...the label ! a software is something more than that ! you say stop spamming ? YOU ?

 you discredited mine posted 08.08.2010 to post yours 11.08.20210 ? and now pronouncing big words for you... such as spam ?

I told you this is NOT cracked, take a look into task manager and you will see a service installed once with registry mechanic that is PERMANENT, staying there even if you uninstall registry mechanic ...is this cracked ? 
and stil talking about labels with me ?

you are right...your's has the label... that's all it has ;)))))))))))))

you have to crack registrymechanic.exe, update.exe, upgrade.exe and eliminate service startmassvc.exe that is automatically loaded at windows boot to have a free full product !
... NOW IT'S OK...ONCE I-VE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS SOFTWARE, ALTHOUGH YOU TOOK THE GUTS TO BLAME ME ON MINE PAGE REGARDING THE SAME SOFT... MINE IS FREE AND FULL AND LETS RAM ALONE , WITHOUT SPYES... ;)))
WHO'S LAUGHING NOW MAN ?"
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-08-11T16:38Z,"SysMechanic you say ? aaahahahahaaaa

we talk about registry mechanic here !

and still saying about wrong labels...as if it would be the product...the product witch is way above your skills to crack and even talk about


you should never enter to put with elderly ;)))"
[V],thethingy,2010-08-11T16:53Z,^^lol
[V],RobbingHood,2010-08-12T00:19Z,"@do_not_delete_me_blindly 

Yeah, my bad; of course I meant Registry Mechanic instead of System Mechanic. BTW: google the word PRECRACKED.

And also sorry that I didn't notice at once that you're a moron or having mental issues. Maybe it's even both, cause it looks like that.

No need to reply and wasting your time, mr. Big Super Hero. Relax and go smoke some bamboo, cause apparently you can use both."

,seororo,2010-08-13T11:55Z,"LOLOLOL. this torrent works. i actually had a headache laughing. @_@ dizzy lol. 

@do_not_delete_me_blindly: startmansvc is a part of registry mechanic that monitors your STARTUP and SHUTDOWN times. NOTHING ELSE. 

and as a side note, i lol'ed harder because of the butchered english. :D"
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-08-14T00:16Z,the one having mental problems is your mother...and you have no fault because of your heritage...I do not expect you to have a self realisation of what you are...the mere fact that you imagine to have understood this software and its cracking it makes all clear to me... zbye and keep your lousy comments and software away from MY POSTS ok ?! ;)
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-08-14T00:21Z,"@seororo only you could think of a immaculate service that only wants to monitor startup and shutdown ... stick with this even if after a few days you will discover that you have no registration

regarding the language...I try speak yours because you will never ever speak mine ;)))))) so go on laughing on your own"
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-08-14T00:27Z,"@thethingy

and you really thinghy that joining a demo with it's crak collected from elswhere..and splashing it inside an archive it represents a torrent aaahahahahahahaaaaaaa

what a good joke !

you rob more than robbinghood and creating a torrent it's no work at all , any 5 years old boy could do it, crack software before laughing boy "
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-08-14T00:36Z,"I was banned bacause of some retards that complained that I found infections within their torrents. but unfortunately the status or the green skeleton aside the nickname...does not represent the real value, the knowledge of someone...and I was tooken for some false alerts... But I tell you that much: the way I enter the installer it allows me to see what lies inside...and I know the bahaviour and recognize the infections ... I am sure that both robbing and thinghy have a few infections here and there they know nothing about...they know instead to laugh...only the laughing it's not their's"

[V],RobbingHood,2010-08-15T00:19Z,"@do_not_delete_me_blindly 

One thing is sure: your medicines or drugs seems to be not working, or are poisoned. You know nothing about TPB, the rules, where to go for help, and about the people here. Still you open you're mouth as wide as possible, while it should be shut.

You've got no idea how many people you're making with your ranting. As long as you're not annoying then go ahead and make our day.


BTW: I know a few nice Romanian girls, but they are quite normal. So apparently not all Romanians are stupid, and you're just a shame for them and Romania. You are a bad bad naughty boy."
,seororo,2010-08-15T12:28Z,"/whistle

i DO know i do not know much, and therein lies the difference between us. 

before you start ranting about things, did you even try to disable the service? registry mechanic still works and does everything it is supposed to do without startman, except that when you click on ""maintain"" and choose system monitor, the graph never changes and never displays new information about your startup and shutdown.

from the above, you don't need to be a rocket scientist to deduct what in blazes startman does. 

as for my language, I'm from Korea, but I speak English very well, if not perfectly. how's that for you? less on the talk, more on the reading buddy. "
,supertronko,2010-08-27T03:55Z,well??? does this stupid crap work or not?????

,suckmycocknow,2010-08-29T14:13Z,"@do_not_delete_me_blindly 
Why are you so mad about RH posting the soft here?
Are you trying to imply he stole it from you?
After all, this is ""The Pirate Bay"" , ppl who post DVDRips and Software, no matter how ""Great"" they are do not create them man. If they could they would get a job developing stuff. 
The so called ""Cracking"" is the last thing on the developers mind. Even if you crack stuff yourself just shows that you know what your doing/talking about, which is good. If your really mad about ppl not cracking stuff themselves, ""Create Something"", but for god sake stop talking.
I'm not laughing at ya, but you got to know your no hero too!"

Can i update it? or will that screw it up."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-09-20T03:21Z,"@CainUAC23

Never update such pirated software, cause usually it's not possible, and it may even result in disabling the program and blocking reinstallation."
