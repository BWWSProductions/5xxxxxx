,vamosvaqueros,2010-09-23T06:28Z,"good call on the .mp3s for season 6 and 7...didn't even notice that...shiem, is it possible to get the .avi or .mkv up for these?  thanks in advance!!"
,hoffy97,2010-10-09T20:52Z,"I think they are ok.  The sizes are way too big for mp3's, and when I do a ""file"" on them, I get the same file type as the other episodes/seasons.  Try just renaming them to "".avi"" and they should work fine."
