Avoiding both flabby waffle and well-being puritanism, it features down-to-earth health advice whether you are in the kitchen, the bedroom, the gym, out on the town or simply looking in the mirror.

Written by menâ€™s health and fitness expert Lloyd Bradley, who along with his panel of experts provides the ultimate menâ€™s health lowdown on how to make the most of your life with the body you have. And because we know how important it is these days, there is a huge section on looks and how to improve them!
