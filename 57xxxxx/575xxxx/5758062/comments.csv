,FTL3,2010-08-15T09:04Z,Help to seed!!!
,bajungadustin,2010-08-27T13:43Z,Why dont you have the rest of the episodes? and why label them wrong? the first episode is called sand castles in the sand... not tentacle vision... tentacle vision came out later so why not include the earlier episodes?
,jpuff,2010-08-28T01:36Z,"I already seen all of them, everything ok.

thanks a lot.

,x6xBowserx6x,2010-11-23T07:52Z,Are these DVDRips?
,x6xBowserx6x,2010-11-24T11:03Z,FTL3 please seed and I will once i have completed downloading.
,myoffive,2011-01-09T23:56Z,"@bajungadustin: The first episode is Tentacle-Vision for Season 7. Check wikipedia and you'll see all the list of episodes. Always check first before you put down people's work. It takes time and effort to put these things together.

Downloading it and will seed when it's done.
Thanks FTL3."

,dovakin,2012-01-22T11:31Z,"firstly its nice to see grown adults arguing about the episode names on a childrens t.v show i came to get them for my 2 year old son and he seems to show more intelect than the grown ""adults"" commenting here!"
,djh101,2012-01-27T09:25Z,"No ""The Monster Who Came to Bikini Bottom""? That's like the best episode. :/"
,inaka_rob,2012-03-29T11:39Z,this is NOT most episodes. this is less than HALF of season 7. this is closer to 1/3 of the season. the only full season 7 I can find is hard dubbed in Russian.
