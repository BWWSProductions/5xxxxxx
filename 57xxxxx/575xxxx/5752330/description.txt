I had this VHS cassette tape given to me to transfer to dvd. I did a search on p2p sites to see if it was already available and to my surprise there isn't one release! So for anybody wanting to learn the 5 string banjo this is for you.

This is, as far as I'm aware, the only torrent available on learning how to play the 5 string banjo, so it is VERY important everybody who downloads this seeds to at least a ratio of 1:1, otherwise it dies.

The emphasis of this easy, hands-on lesson is on traditional folk picking styles and song accompaniment, and almost anyone can do it. Newcomers to the five-string banjo will be playing and singing along with Happy Traum within minutes! 

Happy starts with the basics - how to hold and tune your banjo - then quickly moves on to teach basic chords along with strumming and picking patterns. Working in open G and C tunings, youâ€™ll learn accompaniment techniques as well as ways to pick out melodies for instrumental solos. Hammer-ons, pull-offs, slides and other techniques are gradually added to give your songs authenticity and polish.

Before long, youâ€™ll be picking out the chords and melody lines to these folk and old time country tunes, and will be on your way to further adventures in five-string banjo:  Down in the Valley, Go Tell Aunt Rhody, Heâ€™s Got the Whole World in His Hands, My Home's Across The Smoky Mountains, Handsome Molly, Cumberland Gap, Jesse James, Black-Eyed Susie and Banks Of The Ohio.
