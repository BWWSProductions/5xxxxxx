Safety Catch is the story of a man who never intended to go into the arms trade: he fell into it but he's definitely going to leave soon. And if he wasn;t doing his job, someone else would. And at least he doesn;t work for McDonald;s

Simon McGrath likes to think of himself as a good person. He donates blood (although not bone marrow because he;s heard that hurts), he recycles and he's adopted two tigers. But he has to pay his mortgage just like everyone else and that's why he currently works as an arms dealer.
