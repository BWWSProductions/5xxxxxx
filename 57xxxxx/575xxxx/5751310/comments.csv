,xeneg,2010-08-11T20:20Z,"Hi, I ran the setup.bat but only a black box appears and disappears quickly. I have W7 64 bit. I waited for 10 mintues but nothing happens. I also have the Windows game client."
[T],bulletzz74,2010-08-11T21:04Z,@xeneg When you run the setup.bat don't do run any other program on your computer just leave your pc alone.If that doesn't work try running it as administrator.
,xeneg,2010-08-11T22:04Z,"But I did run it as an admin. A black command line box appears and then vanishes immediately. Do I need to turn off my AV? Is this box supposed to disappear?
Thanks."
,xeneg,2010-08-11T22:09Z,"But I did run it as an admin. A black command line box appears and then vanishes immediately. Is this box supposed to disappear? I'm not running anything. Where do the files get written?

,supz,2010-08-12T17:48Z,"This may well be a stupid question, but can I play this online?"
,supz,2010-08-12T17:50Z,"The reason I ask is because I can't get it to save my game.  I unlock a couple of characters and quit the game and when I load it up again, it has reset itself.  That sucks.

Works perfectly, though and a great upload.  Thanks a lot."
[T],bulletzz74,2010-08-12T18:10Z,"@supz no you can't play online, to save your game create an offline account."
,supz,2010-08-12T18:12Z,Disregard.  You can create a local profile and save that way.  Excellent stuff.

my installing history:

â€¢10-15mins isnt right, waited about 1 and a half hour to finish extraction.

-solution: opened sf.exe itself and find out missing dlls. xlive.dll and another one. downloaded from dll-files.com
â€¢runs really slow fps (lol) cause of 1gb ram
-solution: pc setting> frame|60 fix background|low

thanks to the uploader.
