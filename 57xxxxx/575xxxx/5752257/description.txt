John Keillor of Allmusic describes Boulez's Piano Sonata No. 1:

"Hearing this work brings to mind the few musical prodigies of history whose work from this young age has maintained our interest: Mozart, Schubert, and perhaps a couple of others. Not only does Boulez consolidate a serialist language that has almost no precedent, except for one piece by his instructor, Messiaen's Mode de valeurs et d'intensitÃ©s. In reference to Beethoven's final piano sonata, Boulez's First Piano Sonata is cast in two similarly contrasting movements. The intensity of the work is fierce, and it has a delicacy of phrasing that is normally ascribed to mature masters. It is slightly less than eleven minutes in duration, and like all the music he would publish in his lifetime, explores the remotest nuances of seriousness. Boulez was a very serious young man about music. He was willing to humiliate people, even his own teacher (he once publicly referred to Messiaen's Turangalila Symphony as "brothel music.") Much of his middle-age involved making gestures of apology for his youthful outbursts, but Boulez possessed a charisma that overpowered most other people. His First Piano Sonata contains comparable charm and integrity."
