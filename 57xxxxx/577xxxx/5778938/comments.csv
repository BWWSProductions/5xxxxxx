,zes,2010-08-24T14:08Z,"Im running this on Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit.

I dunno how i did to install it tho.
A friend of mine got real big problems on his Win 7 copy.

But Im sure there is a fix for this out there."

,nickz140v2,2011-06-21T20:50Z,"Gr8 job guys,this game brings back so much fun memories :D.The age when almost all games were good and this is one of the last."
,fugazi0311,2011-07-25T15:21Z,"Ok, so I downloaded it and I can only extract THE_BARDS_TALE.part01.rar. When I try to extract the others (with 7-zip) I get:

Data error in 'THE_BARDS_TALE.is'. File is broken

Ok. Fine. So I tried to see if somehow it would just play with the ISO I was able to extract from  THE_BARDS_TALE.part01.rar, but when I tried to mount it on Disk A in ISODisk I got the error:

Can't create A, you must reboot after install this software. And yes, I did reboot just prior to trying this.

Would be nice if there was a HOWTO or README."
,fugazi0311,2011-07-25T15:26Z,"Ok, well I just installed Magic ISO and I was able to launch the installer so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the problem was just ISO Disk is fail."
,vdarkeaglev,2011-08-09T09:58Z,works just fine for me other than i had to get a crack from somewhere else so it would even play but it runs beautifully even on this old rig i have (intel centrino duo with an Nvidia 7600 go and only 1GB ram yeah I know my specs suck but it works for me ... it played Crysis when it came out on medium settings so that's saying something about this old rig :-P) and i can run with all options max and mediocre res with 0 lag. I will seed for as long as I can.
,Lucysue,2011-08-12T20:27Z,"Can't seem to figure out whats goin on here :/ I try to open the game after installing and it crashes as soon I open it.  

Not sure if this will help but it is what the DL had stated was included after the report. I have Windows XP.
