,sauriva,2010-09-17T19:56Z,"There is no serials or keygens. Alas the original game runs with common cd-key used with other downloads here, I can't get the broken world to work!"
,sauriva,2010-09-17T20:12Z,In addition to that game quits with an exeptoinal data error right after launching (
,cutterninoz,2010-09-19T23:33Z,@sauriva The txt file included in the torrent has serials for both games. For me both games working perfectly
,WolfChieftain,2010-10-01T07:22Z,"@cutterninoz dude what txt file, i looked for it and i even changed some files extensions to see if they were hidden but i found nothing, and the nfo file that comes with this and has ""instructions"" according to the description here is corrupt and wont open, could u pls post the serials for others in a comment or something"
,WolfChieftain,2010-10-01T07:24Z,if u dont post soon i guess ill just use my real key and play the original only (borrower lost disc 1)
,WolfChieftain,2010-10-01T07:54Z,ok so what u have to do is open notepad then go to the folder with the slvr.nfo file (extension might not show) and change the extension to .txt and open it that way in notepad and it has keys in it
,looy999,2010-10-12T13:06Z,Ok i cannot find the file named slvr.nfo either... and i cannot find the keys. is there another way online i can find a keygen?
,Xoriat,2010-10-22T01:07Z,"The game and serial keys work perfectly. The keygens are in the .nfo file included in the torrent. Thanks for the submission, slvr7017!"
,ProducerSkeleton,2010-11-12T02:45Z,"hey, did anyone else have a problem finding the Expansion 'broken world' directory? I have DS2 installed and runs fine, but I can't find anything that has to do with the expansion. help?"
,koberdorf,2010-11-14T20:41Z,I have it working but when I goto create my character and hit the next button nothing happens I cango back but nothing else happens?
,Sparqz,2010-12-20T21:55Z,"thanks for the torrent slvr7017 its great, and for those who dont understand just follow Wolf Chieftains instructions they work perfect."
,joshwah1,2011-01-10T08:30Z,my just keeps saying insert disk 1 to play how do i get around this
,akuswanto,2011-01-12T10:21Z,"thanks this game is work!!
i think u not blind but just slow brain.
because u download
the first you must download software virtual cd or virtual clonedrive and you will can see crack and serial number."
,Mrshinracorp99,2011-01-13T07:03Z,Epic win. Got it running on both my laptops LAN. Had to install both the same way and used the same Exe. Im using all save mod with either DS2 or DS2 BW. Once you use All saves once and save you can use that profile LAN with complete compatibility. I highly recommend playing LAN with friends. Too much fun. 
,Mrshinracorp99,2011-01-13T07:09Z,"You have to mount the game or burn the ISO to a DVD. Use Daemon tools lite. Load the ISO from DTlite interface, mount, then click on the file in DTlite. A clock will appear as it loads. Run disk one, then mount disk 2 and run it too when it asks. dont press anything just let it continue. Use the Keys provided. Install BW after that if you want. "
,akuswanto,2011-01-15T18:54Z,"burning to DVDRW or if u dont have DVDRW you must download software virtual cd or virtual clonedrive and you will can see crack and serial number.
but IMPORTENT U GO TO ""C:\Program Files\2K Games\Dungeon Siege 2 Broken World\DungeonSiege2.exe"" for Play."
,gannon1898,2011-01-27T22:56Z,"here are for the ppl who are ignorant and cant seem to find the keys

,Fasth89,2011-02-02T15:25Z,"Cant play multiplayer (LAN) :(
Can see when we enter chat but dont see created games.. Help plz!"
,Rastamanse,2011-02-08T02:29Z,"For beginners!
1. Use PowerISO or Deamon Tools 
2. Open Deamon tools and click on mount and take the iso file and push play. or other option in poweriso that is most easy of all rightclick with mouse on the file and mount.
3. Go to computer, right click on the DVD and click on play setup.
4. the rest you should understand, crack should be found in DVD inside it if you rightclick and open!
5. Never ask again"
,Rastamanse,2011-02-08T02:32Z,"btw if lan doesnt work search for Dungeon Siege 2 updates, and when u see what update 1.03 or something search for dungeon siege 2 1.03 crack and put it on where u installed dungeon siege 2 and overwrite. for people who dosnt understand english - use Google translate and copy"
,SleepCobi,2011-03-15T19:32Z,Thanks for the upload! It works GREAT!
,K_e_n_z,2011-03-18T15:29Z,How do I change the .nfo file to a .txt file?
,K_e_n_z,2011-03-19T20:11Z,"Okay, whenever I launch it goes to where it loads with the dot's, and then it stops working. Anyone know how to fix this?"
,OMGnix,2011-03-22T09:00Z,"after downloading the torrent you must install an image/iso mounting software alcohol
or daemon tools
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/products/dtLite
after you have installed daemon

1.daemon tools window-add device
2.right click the new device->mount
3.mount the ds2gold.iso
4.now you can access the file just like a normal dvd-just check your new device(my computer)-
5.read instructions included

thanks for great upload "

,vdutch,2011-06-17T10:24Z,"seriously people are complaining about seeds, i think people are just saying seed because either they dont know how to change their bandwith allocation, are ignorant and dont know that the seed to peer ratio is like 4/1, have a shity connection, or are just stupid. i am downloading at night when my dl speed is usually the slowest because less people are online but yet my average dl speed is 860kbps after 10min of dl'ing. so obviously all you people bitching abut seeders are wrong. so many stupid, ignorant, crybabys online now-a-days. even if i was dl'ing at 50kbps i woulsnt care its a free fucking game jesus christ people are so ungrateful. and idk if you idiot noticed but this game was uploaded 10 months ago and is like 6-7 years old so yea not many ppl will be seeding cause not many are dl'ing it holy shit you people piss me off i cant stand being online anymore ignorant people just ruin it there should be a test before your allound to use the internet to have atleast some intelligence i swear my 7yo sister is smarter then you fags when it comes to computer shit fuck off all of you

ty uploader and seeders. fuck you other cunts fyi took me just over 1 hour to dl so stop crying you pussy, holy shit ignorance "
