[V],MKVGuy,2010-08-24T21:01Z,"@muk0690, ty, original SS increases my work that is why I found BS Player, if you or anybody knows about some application which can produce individual .JPG file then plz suggest me those..

@faizaan, yes.. plz guys give me a break.. do not post any request till the end of this month, already have a list which is pending to be posted..

@arunlatvia, I noticed them when I posted this but that is in red color and its the tranlated version so its not perfect..

@sup3xtian, no sorry..

@jobinpkd, thanx man for your help, but sory fox I am not ready with 720p rips, may be after 3-4 months..

@jamal_sherazi, try exploring MeGUI, StaxRip, Handbreak, MediaCoder..

@wira020, I have my doubt that the source is R5, I am waiting for more rips to popup, specially waiting for the Blue-ray rip..

WILL TAKE REQUESTS FROM NEXT MONTH..

Thanks"
