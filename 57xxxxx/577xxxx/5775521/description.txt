Whereas Under the Pretense of Present Tense was a perfect record to drive to, To Bury Within the Sound is something less forceful, something more appropriate to drift off into sleep with. The songs are less immediate and in your face, more slowly evolving and passive. This album demonstrates Engine Down at the top of their songwriting ability: putting together ambient sounds and beautiful interlocking clean guitar melodies, experimenting with different sounds such as keys and complex shifting song structures into something full and gorgeous.
