MY FIRST DISNEY Original Soundtrack Best Japanese Version

This is quite a rare double album of original soundtracks from Japanese language versions of many Disney films.  It is effectively a Best of compilation, and I suspect the title could more accurately have been translated as Original Soundtracks: Best of, Japanese Version, but hey, that was what was on the CD.

Anyway, this is great for children, especially for Japanese or half-Japanese children.  My daughter loves it so much we have to play it whenever we go driving.

All tracks have been fully tagged in iTunes, so should load into iTunes without any further input from you.  Ripped in iTunes Plus, 256bps stereo (128bps per channel).

Enyoy this album (I do).

This is my 2nd attempt, as the first time I could not get it to upload.
