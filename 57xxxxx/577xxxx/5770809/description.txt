an updated (as of 08/2010) version of sjbrand99's torrent containing HQ mp3 rips of all 16bit vinyl releases, 16bit remixes, remixes of 16bit tracks, all mixes, as well as a few solo tracks from DRT and Kidnappa.

most tracks are 320kbps, some unreleased or harder to find stuff may have a slightly lower bitrate. mixes come in their original bitrates, whether 320 or not.
 since i am uploading this torrent for the sake of preview and promotion, i encourage everyone to support the artists and purchase the records and/or see these guys live (both of which are the ways good music is meant to be enjoyed)!!
