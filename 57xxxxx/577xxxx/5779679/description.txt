I think this is just part 1? Oh, so kids who are not familiar with torrents, in order to download these files you need a torrent client (I personally have used utorrent for a few years with no problems) and they're incredibly easy to find to download. If you're not comfortable dealing with torrents..well...that's kindof just too bad because there's 3 gb of video in the format I received it and I don't feel like paying for a file converter...so this is my distribution method. Or I guess I could put it on a jump drive for you if you get me one. ANYWAYSSSSS, for those of you for whom this works out, enjoy :D
