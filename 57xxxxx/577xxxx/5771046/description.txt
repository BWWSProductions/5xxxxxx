Free Energy is an American rock band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The members include Scott Wells, Paul Sprangers, Evan Wells, Geoff Bucknam, and Nick Shuminksy.

The Wells Brothers and Sprangers are originally from Red Wing, Minnesota, where they first started playing together in the now-defunct indie rock band, Hockey Night. The three moved to Philadelphia, where they joined up with guitarist Bucknam and drummer Shuminksy to form the band in the Fall of 2008. Free Energy performs melodic, hook-laden rock tunes with a heavy dose of bombastic glam and classic dust. Critics have compared their sound to 70's rock acts like Journey and The Cars. The band rose to national prominence in March of 2010 with the critically acclaimed release of their debut album Stuck on Nothing. On March 17, Rolling Stone Magazine included Free Energy in an article about the best new bands of 2010. The band has also received high marks from Spin Magazine, who called their work "excellent". On March 17 the band performed on The Late Show with David Letterman.
