,Jacob_blade,2010-09-14T14:30Z,"Absolutely perfect job!  ""Copy paste this here and it will work"".  How perfect; thank you so much!  PLEASE continue to bring us the good oldies back!"
,Jacob_blade,2010-09-14T14:32Z,"Absolutely perfect job!  ""Copy paste here and you're done""!  You made it super easy for anyone to enjoy a prize of a game that is difficult to find anymore.  PLEASE continue to bring back the good oldies!"
,careyfleet,2010-09-19T14:46Z,"@Jacob_blade Thanks a lot for the feedback mate. Much appreciated. Only thing is, I need requests!!! If you want a game uploaded then please ASK FOR IT! =D

My e-mail is c.a.r.e.y@hotmail.co.uk. Send game requests and they will be uploaded in 2 hours."
,fishcorn,2010-09-27T13:50Z,"Thank you, very quick and easy. Highly recommended for Vista and 7 users since the Battle.net Edition runs horribly on those systems."
,lemming8907,2010-10-24T03:59Z,"For Windows 7 (and possibly Vista) users. I had to tamper slightly with the target copy paste that Careyfleet put in to make sure you get the DOSBox and the game running just from double clicking so keep in mind that if your normal folder is different like mine is [Program Files (x86)], then you will have to change the target copy and paste as well. Thanks for the step by step for this Carey maybe I can get it to work for some of my other games I need to run DOSBox for! Appreciate it. :)"
,Benjibee,2010-10-31T05:20Z,"Hey, I followed the guide (very helpful!) but I'm still having a problem.  When I double click, Dosbox opens but the game doesn't run.  Any suggestions?"
,careyfleet,2010-11-02T09:03Z,"@lemming8907+Benjibee:

Thanks for the heads-up guys. I will now reconfigure any new games I upload to support x86 and x64 Windows 7. If anyone is having trouble on another operating system (Windows XP, Vista etc...) could you please notify me either by comment or e-mail so I can rectify the problem.

Thanks,
DOS-Carey"

,majikmovez,2010-11-29T04:29Z,"Best instructions anyone has ever written, however I am slightly confused on how to use the map editor. I can open it and create and save a map but then when I choose custom scenario it does not locate the PUD files. I think it's a mounting issue. Do you know what I am talking about? Do you know how to fix?"
,RaySoul,2010-12-21T17:56Z,"A bunch of people are asking where's the Target box thing and no one's replied yet. I'm pretty clueless too,I'd appreciate some help"
,Marunka,2011-01-05T21:03Z,"To RailSoul: it must be on shortcut! You have to CREATE shortcut from WAR2EDIT and then there is ""target"".
And I thank you very much, CAREYFLEET, for very detailed instruction!"
,Marunka,2011-01-05T21:04Z,Sorry - RaySoul is your nick:-)
,blombardo,2011-01-07T07:34Z,Thanks - I own the original game... it works decent on my pc but I can't find a NOCD... Thought I'd try this - but guess what - I found a better one: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6020088/Warcraft_II_Battle_NET_Edition_Rip_%28305MB_w_Win7_fixes%29   Thanks though.
,careyfleet,2011-01-07T17:22Z,"Sorry guys, in this torrent, there was a mistake... It should read: ""Right click the shortcut and click properties"" the TARGET BOX is in there.

Thanks,
DOS-Carey"
,lkorbel,2011-01-25T01:34Z,"I downloaded this torrent, and the game has been working perfectly for me. I am on the final act, and now all of a sudden, the game is asking me for the CD in order to play a single player game. It was working fine for days, and now all of a sudden it is asking me for a CD? Has anyone else experienced this?"
,lkorbel,2011-01-25T03:33Z,"I've spent two hours researching the problem regarding the program asking me for the CD, and I have yet to find a solution. I reinstalled warcraft to another directory, and the game is working, but I want to play my saved game that was almost completed. It seems that warcraft uses .sav files, but I cannot find one of those anywhere, nor can I find anything that remotely looks like a saved file. Does anyone know what the saved games save to?"
,jaredk85,2011-01-28T05:26Z,"Hey there - I was having troubles getting the game to work, and I noticed you have the link to the Google account for an updated version. But when I try to login using the info you provided, it says it has sent an SMS text message to your cell phone with a verification number to verify identity. I know you probably don't like getting these messages if that's still your phone, so I'm hoping you can help me out here... I want to play this game so bad, it's killing my soul!"
,careyfleet,2011-02-08T10:27Z,"Hi everyone,

Thanks for notifying me and the community of your problems. This was my second ever torrent, however, and DOS-Carey has improved ten-fold since then. I now use batch files to process the installation automatically and is working almost perfectly on all Operating Systems. My G-Mail ""DOS-Carey dropbox"" is no longer active, I think that Google has blocked the account due to so many people logging in from different IP adresses. I will figure a way around this ASAP. I have been very busy recently which is why I haven't been uploading. DOS-Carey will be back soon and will be better than ever =D Thanks for all your support and patience.

Thanks, 
DOS-Carey"
,charliebrowne,2011-02-18T06:48Z,"ok, this happens to me all the time, everytime i download games, all it is is a blank white page? and i click on it then sais windows cant open this, does that mean i need to install winzip or something.

i know shit all about piracy, but wanting to learn

charlie-browne@hotmail.com if you know how to resolve this 
cheers in advance"
,drunkjoker333,2011-03-11T21:39Z,"followed installation instructions to every word and still nothing, just a prompt screen comes up and that's it"
,BIGNOOBY,2011-04-12T01:14Z,"Hey careyfleet  Thanks a lot for Up i'll see if i can get it 2 work and then i'll say how it worked dor me..


And BtW  Do you think you can upload Silent storm up
English version ??"
,21clg,2011-05-18T05:58Z,"Ok, in your instructions you say:

...8. In the ""target"" box, copy and paste this exactly:

""C:\Program Files\DOSBox-0.74\DOSBox.exe"" ""C:\Program Files\warcraftii\war2.exe"" -conf ""c:\Program Files\warcraftii\DOSBox 0.74 Options"" -exit -fullscreen""

9. Click change icon and browse to C:\Program Files\warcraftii.....

But the problem is is what part of that whole thing in quotes do I paste into the target box??? it keeps saying its an invalid path. I tried it with the two outermost quote marks, aswell as without. I dont get it. Please clarify."
,21clg,2011-05-18T07:11Z,"Ok, I figured it out. The path to DOSbox was incorrect. My DOSbox is installed in the ProgramFiles(x86), so I just had to change that in the target path accordingly"
,Deathsky22,2011-06-26T14:34Z,"Probably should of guess that this would be difficult being on a mac. *sigh* didnt get what i expected the file to be. thats besides the point though ... anyone there to help me out here? ive actually never seen a mds file and what it does. i seen converting and things like that but âŚ i sincerely have no idea. vie dug around, downloaded 3 different failed versions of WC2 ToD and im actually kind of frustrated. any help is appreciated."
,-Crank-,2011-07-23T19:12Z,Thxxx careyfleet  works fine as long as you follow the instuctions .... this game bings bac sum old memories :D!
,Spongebobsquarepants,2011-09-25T18:13Z,Ok sorry for this question but im not yet used to this but this aint the original game is it -.-?
,Nagrom-ORIGINAL,2011-10-31T02:13Z,"THIS TORRENT IS A MASSIVE HEAD ACHE! If your not a CS major or if you've never touched a computer before 1995 don't download this, sure it's a quick download but there are other, easier to install, downloads. apparently there is a link to fix it but the account expired or something. Pity really, everyone here who's gotten it working seems thrilled. "
,frumplin,2012-01-27T04:19Z,"hello sir! first of all, I would like to say this is my first GAME DL. and i must say bro...KUDOS... works perfect except for one thing. it isnt running in fullscreen. for some reason its windowed, and i noticed the target window ""copy paste"" thing has the words ""fullscreen"" at the end. i was wondering if there was a way to run it in fullscreen... any help would be appriciated. no complaints other than i can literally only see like 6 building in the window...lol... GREAT DL BRO !!!!"
,NoahDFA,2012-02-11T13:07Z,Worked great. Very fast download as well.
