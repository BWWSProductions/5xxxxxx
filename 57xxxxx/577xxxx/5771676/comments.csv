,justregged,2010-08-18T23:57Z,"just so you know your site isn't trusted by firefox, you might want to sort that out"
[T],bg2k9,2010-08-19T02:39Z,"@justregged   no our site is fine, what it is, we have recently changed to more secure ssl, https instead of http - so when u get the untrusted page in firefox, just click on ""i understand the risks"" then click ""get certificate"" and then ""confirm security exception"", this just makes our site more secure for our community and all our members :)"
,justregged,2010-08-20T18:31Z,"thats fine but it still dont explain why you dont have a valid cert and well with all the other sites out there why take the risk with yours, it just drives ppl away and i aint bothering so thanks but no thanks its not for me"
[T],bg2k9,2010-08-20T20:31Z,"@justregged  the reason this happens is because we have moved to a secure https line instead of http, this allows our members to download via ssl meaning ur isp wont be able to see what u download so its more secure for us and our members"
