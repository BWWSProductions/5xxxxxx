BBC THREE's first urban, multi-species, adult puppet comedy. Five urban animals hang out in the backyard of an innercity pub. Created by Adam Miller, written by Jon Brown and Daniel Peak.


All season one episodes in 720p, x.264, mkv container.

Also includes behind the scenes documentary - avi format.

Note:  All episodes have 2 channel audio except Episode 2 which has a 6 channel audio. I had problems streaming this to my PS3 but if you change your settings to stereo, or convert via mkv2vob, then it plays fine. 

All episodes play OK with Media player, Splash etc on your PC. 

Enjoy, and as always please help seed.
