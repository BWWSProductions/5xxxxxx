[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-19T03:54Z,"@ Everyone -    The Twilight Saga Eclipse 2010 DVDSCR XviD-PrisM  was just released, I am downloading it right now, I will encode it and upload it to the seedbox tonight. I will upload it here in 14-16 hours, cuz in a few hours I am going to sleep.

@ Romo234 - I will gladly do The Robocop Trilogy, I will have to download them as I do not own/have them. I will probably upload it in about a week.

@ zero.nine20 - yes finally. I was waiting for a R5 or DVDSCR. BTW it is nice to meet you. 

@ RIggsta - It is a good movie, plus it has the sexy Angelina Jolie in it."
