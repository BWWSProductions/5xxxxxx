                    Older Woman.                             
                    Pete versus Life is a new five-part comedy  
                    drama starring Rafe Spall as struggling young  
                    sports journalist Pete Griffiths. Although well  
                    meaning, Pete often lacks the emotional  
                    maturity required to deal with his more  
                    intricate problems. He wishes that life had  
                    clearly defined rules, like sport. But life  
                    isn't like sport, as Pete is only beginning to  
                    realise. In this episode, Pete meets an  
                    attractive older lady at an art auction, and  
                    they hit it off. But being a 'toy boy' results  
                    in complications.
