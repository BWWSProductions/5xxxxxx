,anand86,2010-08-18T17:26Z,"Hi Riddler,
Didn't get your reply on 1337x.
Can you please rip Welcome to Dongmakgol 720p?"
,muthineni,2010-08-18T17:43Z,"can u do salt r5 please...?
it would be amazing if u could squeeze in new popular releases as soon as they r out occasionally rather than uploading out of demand old movies (though requested)


they would become more popular torrents than the old ones... think about it dude... u deserve it after all the painful encodings u do..."
,akajaykarthik,2010-08-18T18:06Z,"hey can u upload ""The Pianist""?"

Excellent Quality
Thank You very much
Please seed................ "
,tricycle515,2011-01-29T10:57Z,"why not just make it down to a
50 MB filesize?  talk about a botched
rookie encode!

i'll stick with the proper 4 GB version.
you can't cheat bitrate quality."
,Zarkow,2011-07-26T19:57Z,"Why the arbitrary ~500mb filesize? Go for full CD or single layer DVD atleast, and maximize bitrate whichever choice you make. This low bitrate only make the movie look like garbage on any decent (46""+) TV..."
