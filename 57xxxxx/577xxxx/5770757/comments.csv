I prefer SDH then the regular; for instance a known tune is played then you're angry with yourself that can't remember who's the composer then here comes SDH saying...""Soft tune by Chopin..."" or ""Salsa""  or what ever ;-) I love SDH-s.
You're welcome."

[T],FatFreddy69,2010-09-10T12:51Z,"Ripped from an old rented disc and the disc probably had a scratch between 2min22s - 2min55s. 
It's in the video, not in DTS.
It can happen. This is the first time it happened with me. Sorry about it.
Just ignore those 30 seconds. C'est la vie"

Drop the mkv and your Audio Track in mkvmerge.
Click Global/check Enable Splitting & check ...after timecodes

Copy/paste in...after timecodes:
00:02:16,00:02:56

 Start muxing. When finished you get 3 files. Now click File/New on mkvmerge, drop the first splited file, click append(right from input files)  and chose the third splited file then Start muxing.
I've done it, muxrd in the Spanish Audio, it worked."

FAIL"
