,rafayel,2010-08-18T14:03Z,your previous released with DUQA name was XVID....now superDUQA with H264.....not so compatible with dvd player..........
[T],superDUQA,2010-08-18T16:14Z,"@ rafayel 

Video Codec H264

Audio Codec MP3

For compatiblilty DVD Player 

you need a decent dvd player with the feature of codec, it will cost around $25.

If Video don't work on the pc you need to get VLC  player, every new codec would be updated automatically, and you don't have no worries how to use it.

,Rod321,2010-08-19T12:22Z,"Hi superDUQA, 
Another good movie. It is getting boring, you guys are putting out good quality every time. 
I did find one of the 3 movies of yours that I just downloaded needed DIVX to run it on the computer, but that is not a problem, I am mearely mentioning it for other downloaders. Audio 10/10, Visuals 9/10, Sync 10/10
Thanks also to Seeds & Peers, the download was fast. 
I am disappointed that there is not another comment here to give others an opinion."

,3rdAdam,2010-08-31T10:01Z,"Warning:

After downloading this movie i (and my service provider) received an email  from Columbia Pictures threatening me with legal action if i continue to download.

Even though they commited a crime themselves to track who downloaded this torrent, right down to the household let alone the ISP.

They think they can get away with bullying the little people because they have endless supply of money to throw at the courts.

Stupid greedy morons."
