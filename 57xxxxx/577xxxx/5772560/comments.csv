[V],globeplus,2010-08-18T21:55Z,"The main game is complete and nothing missing , i have another file with an innovating thing to the pc games downloaded in the torrents : it is a file with 735 mb that have the extra missions or arcade mode for this game , the main complete game is 2.6 gb no doubt and for 75 mb you get the extra missions , now you that are reading this comment ask the next thing : why then the file with the extra missions is innovating for files available at the torrents ? i tell why , because have a double option after the download , you not only can integrate as usual in a easy way the extra missions on the main file but also you can start playing the extra missions immediatly and that means what ? means that for example you can start playing the extra missions while waiting for the game , means to that you can be plaing the main game and getting the extra missions in a nice way for when you finish the main game etc ... ok d, now i give to all of you interested on the extra missions the link :

[V],globeplus,2010-08-18T21:59Z,I just like to know who the morrons that without dgetting the file are putting negative votes because I WORK WITH COMPETENCE AND HARD  and i don´t respect bullshit votes for borring uploaders !!! GOT IT ?
,Redundantos,2010-08-18T23:32Z,"globeplus
First of all we appreciate your work. You can tell it by the number of peers.
And what about the negative votes, I'm pretty sure it's because of lousy description of release. All you have to do is write a few words about what's been ripped:
converted/ripped videos?
converted/ripped music/sounds?
deleted languages?
You've done some hard work so describe it. Because everybody knows you can't just compress 7,3 Gb to 2,6 Gb without losing anything in most cases. And what's missing - that's what important about game RIPs. No one gives a shit about system requirements and game description when deciding download the RIP or full game. 
And what's that 735 mb of extra missions? Is that what's been ripped or what? I couldn't google anything about them.
Best regards."

Did you read what I wrote above? Because it seems you're just talking to yourself.
You are NOT competent enough if you can't just describe what you've done with the game.
COMPLETE MAIN GAME WITH EVERYTHING NORMAL - that's not a proper decription!
Just write a few words and everyone will be happy. And you'll get much more positive votes."
[V],globeplus,2010-08-19T01:12Z,"Redundantos you need to make an effort to try to understand the correct philosophy on the presentation of the information of the file , when i am saying with everything normal is that is anything missing or alterated from the game , in this line of work of files the users naturally have a 2nd instinct thinking if it is any anomaly on the file in anyway to get the positive size , of course i am very competent and the prove is the naturality that i present game after game fantastic sizes for the latest pc games keeping more as possible the gameplay of the games , i have many years and lot of experience in this line of work , everyone of us lke to think that can be useful to the others in someway to feel useful and prestative for himself and i am competent more as possible for this line of work giving my share in this small torrent world with positive work that can be a valid option to the users , so donÂ´t be so apreensive with the text of the things like someone can die or something , just givetime and maje the correct interpretation of the things . "
,Redundantos,2010-08-19T03:11Z,"globeplus
You just dont listen. When youre saying that everything is normal that doesnt mean that it is normal for everyone. For example, its not normal for me if videos are overcompressed, its not normal for someone else if there are no multiplayer etc. Thats why its VERY important to specify whats ripped. Ive done some gamerips by myself in my days so I know what Im saying.
And you are doing it all the time, this is not the first your release Ive seen. In your Assasins Creed 2 release, for example, videos were way overcompressed and registry editing was necessary just to start the game.
So dont say that you are so competent and dont act like there no one else to rip the games. 
In few words: just write down what youve done with the game, everything else is ok."
,the_Reaper534,2010-08-19T03:24Z,"Great work as always globe, keep it up and dont let it get you down what others say you're doing great

so long..."
[V],globeplus,2010-08-19T03:54Z,"In this type of work what is important is the gameplay beeing respected more as possible getting the best size possible the rest is bullshit , if the gameplay is complete and nothing missing to the main game then it is everything normal thatÂ´s all , the users already know that in the torrents only  in few exceptions is possible the multiplayer and even in that case is always complicate with servers or necessary keys to play with regularity , so what you can expect is the single player mode complete and that if it is a nice work maded in the worked executable to the game and it is like that in the torrents , you play what is possible and that is not that bad , just donÂ´t be taxative about things , you are simple too much worry about secondary things that doesnÂ´t really matter , i do a correct analysis on the files and then i decide the best strategie to the file be presented , if the single player mode is available with everything normal that is ok , it is work done and everyone happy with the size of the file and the gameplay , just relax in your view about the files and in ac2 the new online drm difficult the normal running of the executable , so you are already in luck if it is possible with the ubisoft gane launcher registered in a correct way to play the game and with values.dbf to the server emulator , the true is that was a tough task to beat the new online drm for that game , it was close a month with the users stopped at the first cene with a white screen , so getting the main game complete and only needing searching worked executables or server emulators for a game in that circunstancial conditions to play was more than ok , sometimes you as user have to adaptate to what is possible to do and that doesnÂ´t mean always that it is what you want , so if you get the complete game for a game with this difficulties and still have your nice size and all the other files need the same things to make the game work , so under that circunstances it was the correct possible work to the game , you need to improve your appreciation in a file work analising all the context before starting making critics , it looks like you want to implicate with me but you donÂ´t know exactly why , we , the pc gamers in the torrents have to understand that we play what is possible and in the best way possible and thatÂ´s it , you simply canÂ´t act trying to lok to torrent games files like they was bought , you can play if you get lucky but in the way that is possible , ok ? just analise better all the things next time before criticise , my work and donÂ´t forget that is always the correct best possible work under the circunstances thatÂ´s all .

You lied to many times i hope you can start to say the truth i mind ""what it's ripped and what not""

It's the movies with ALL the audios?
It's the game with the 5 audios?
At what resolution and bitrate are the movies?

PS:
Freearc it's GPL not freeware.

[V],globeplus,2010-08-21T19:33Z,"To parrot2 : next time do an appropriate text to show the situation and please write a all book but beside that i never said it that was multi language and the parts the other languages cann be used are not signitificaly as that , what i mean is that the text on the game not specially important and the voices still in english anyway , so why spending more size for extra 4 languages without ant special pointon that ? when it is possible and i have many files comproving that i leave the languages too bur fot not too much size and in some way the use of the languages can be really relevenmt in the gameplay , but this is an action game and what it matters is keep the concentration on the gameplay and the text not really relevant anyway beside that is a story going but anyone and this is normal on computer games that knows a little bit of english understand the easy english that the text is presented , this a more than 7 giga game in the original pc-dvd iso and i need to do my work and get the best size in things that donÂ´t affect in anyway the gameplay , i hope it will be clear that my inttention is not cut the languages just like that and always make an effort to keep them but game to game i need to analise the conteud of the file and take the decision in keeping them or not depending on gthe size and the influence of them in the context ofthe game . Thank you to the users to understanding but they can believe me when i say that i make a correct analysis before making the decisions about the work . thank you for understanding ."

Link:

http://connect.creativelabs.com/developer/Wiki/OpenAL%20Installer%20for%20Windows.aspx

It seems people are only looking to take and not to give.
I downloaded 2.6 GB and uploaded 25.6 GB and I'm still seeding. This is poor people. I request all gamers who are into these kinda games, to SEED god damnit.
To add up, I must say that, 
Globe rulezz. He is the GOD OF RiPP[the developers must be envying him :)] 
I am running WIN 7 32(x86) bit and the game is flawless."
,murrambingi,2010-08-23T15:31Z,"I am also running win7 32 X86 and it is awsome and i have already uploaded 2.2GB and will continue to seed until 150% is reached, before i had completed my download i had already uploaded 1.6GB so i am uploading fast to the next person.
If anyone wants the link to a working Freearc archiver the link is here:http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail/FreeArc-for-Windows/1221131527/1  also if you have Norton 360 Anti-Virus you must dissable it completely before following the steps for installation other wise it will reject both the Freearc archiver and the game before you even try to start the process.
I want to send a BIG THX to globeplus for the upload, it worked very well, but at first i must admit i got a bit frustrated with my security when trying to let Freearc use my System32, and haha i thought that somehow after completely disabling both of my securities that they were still active because there was a missing OpenAL32dll file but it was'nt.
All went very well thx very much, i may even seed 200% to help with the seeding of this torrent :) bye for now..."
,comet.vermont,2010-08-26T13:30Z,"Hey globe, if you don't mind, how in the HELL do you manage to compress these files to this level?

I have tried over & over using FreeARC, WinRAR, 7-Zip, blah blah & all I can get is maybe a 2.6bg to 2.35 at MOST.  MY GOD, MASS EFFECT was taken from 9.13GB to 3.74, Kane & Lynch 2 as well.

Is there any way you'd explain this technique to me?"
