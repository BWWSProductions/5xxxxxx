Here's the simple instructions: Mount the iso with Virtual CloneDrive (freeware). Rip the virtual drive with AnyDVD HD (fully functional trial). Result is a raw BD directory on your HD. Now you can demux the .m2ts (with tsMuxeR GUI) and remux is to .mkv (with MKVtoolnix). Voilรก!

Btw the Virtual CloneDrive mounted ISO can be played directly with PowerDVD 10. But the reason for these instruction was to everyone who prefers .mkv's.

And thanks for the release. Had been looking for this one for some time."
