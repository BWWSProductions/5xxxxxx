"14 Chefs Compete"

The Top 14 contestants enter the MASTERCHEF 
kitchen for the very first time and begin on a 
journey that will change their lives. Judges 
Gordon Ramsay, Joe Bastianich and Graham Elliot 
put the contestants through a series of 
challenges throughout each episode and at the 
end of them some contestants are sent home 
while the rest are left to move on in the 
competition. During the team challenge, the 
contestants spend the day feeding hundreds of 
Marines at Camp Pendleton. The team who wins 
the challenge is safe from elimination while 
the losers return to the MASTERCHEF kitchen to 
face a pressure test.

Enjoy :)
