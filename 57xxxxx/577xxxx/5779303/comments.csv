,sbale,2010-10-24T08:03Z,"It appears raymondhome has upoaded this torrent in several formats. In the one which is 733 mb the uploader comment: ""QUALITY IS BETTER THAN PREVIOUS RELEASES"" So i suggest to check that one"
,starcream,2010-11-04T08:20Z,"This not the original language. The sample is misleading because it has the actor's real voice when he's speaking English, but for the rest of it the voice is dubbed Mandarin instead of Cantonese."
