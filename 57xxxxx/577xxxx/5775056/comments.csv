,VolatilisOculus,2010-08-27T20:25Z,"Can someone help me install this one? Iâve unzipped all of the folders and unrarâd all of the .rar files to the point where a dmg has been generated. However, when I go to install the content after I installed the app, it told me that it cannot install the content until the app is installed."
,higgins11,2010-09-21T00:06Z,"This isn't exactly related to this particular torrent, but I downloaded Komplete 7 and all of the Band, Choir, Orchestral, etc libraries were properly installed, but Kontakt 4 doesn't read them as instruments so I can only access the indiivudal samples. Does anyone know how I can get Kontakt 4 to recognize these ""collections of samples"" in an integrated instrument format?? Thanks"

Hey, buddy! Where did you download Komplete 7?"
,filmsy123,2010-12-27T11:36Z,"It works perfectly and I can load my East West Colossus library to Logic Pro and use, but it required to be activated after using for 20 minutes something..... can anyone suggest how to tackle this issue? Many thanks!"
,Symn,2011-01-13T22:22Z,"awesome, hope this works..."
,DoaKao,2011-02-08T22:16Z,"first of all, appreciate the up.

however, i dont see one fucking good reason why you have to put .rars in .zips, so that when i uncompress the .zips, every single .rar is placed in it's own folder (which by the way pops up), making it a PAIN in the ass to extract it.

stupid as hell."
,achase,2011-04-05T23:30Z,"I am having the same problem that VolatilisOculus is having!! Please help! The application installs no problem, but the factory content refuses to install. It says I must run Kontakt 4 before running the installer. I of course ran the program, runs great, but the factory content still wont install!! How can I get around this?"
,filmsy123,2011-04-21T13:51Z,"It's gonna be ""Demo Timeout"" and unable to play the instruments. :( Any help please??"

Did you ever figure out the East West time out issue."
,snavem,2011-09-07T22:43Z,"Filmsy123

What I am doing is using kontakt 3 (which you can find on here without activation issues) to run east west stuff so far so good. I know its a step back but I use K4 on other stuff and K3 for 3rd party."
