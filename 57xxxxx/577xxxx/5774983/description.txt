Isabella Swan was a normal teenage girl, in a normal world. Until she met Edward Cullen and Jacob Black. Since then she has been up against a Sadistic Vampire, The Volturi and an angry werewolf, Paul. But what lies ahead is something only Edward's 'brother', Jasper Hale, can help the Cullens with. A Newborn Vampire Army created by a Revenge ridden Victoria for what Edward did to her mate, James. 'Mate for Mate' as Victoria sees it. But what she doesn't know is the Cullens have a secret on their side. With Graduation coming fast, Bella gets more and more worried about becoming immortal and the fight. But the real question is: Who will she choose?

All credit to a member of demonoid where this came from im not giving name as i think the guy dont need too much publicity but i know who you are and so do others so thanks (Apologies i never believed you) 

I never cropped out the logo at the bottom i hate cropping and prism had already cropped some out so didnt want to lose even more .Didnt blur it out either so left it the way it was.Just tweaked the video a touch.Everyones probably already got this but had to do a copy...

Enjoy !
