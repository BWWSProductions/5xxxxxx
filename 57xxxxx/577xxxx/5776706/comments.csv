,fsxvzla,2010-08-20T20:49Z,"Hey asshole ! NOT MORE FREEWARE, this place is not for that."
,aarque,2010-08-20T20:49Z,"raybob, FS2004 models are perfectly capable of supporting the VC, it is not a consequence of the platform. The circumstance is that airplane writers must create a 360ì§¸ model of the interior of the plane, which is as arduous as creating the exterior and not nearly as cool. Additionally, many planes are ported over from 2002 and '98 which didn't support the VC.

 What blows my mind are all the leechers who are too unresourceful to go over to Avsim and Simviation and get these things themselves and the fact that you indulge their laziness. Pirate Bay is for pirates, Corsairs of the internet, not sloths, IMO. Whole thing makes me laugh, but whatever, if it floats yer boat."
,fsxvzla,2010-08-20T20:57Z,NOT MORE FREEWARE A.S.S.H.O.L.E. !
[T],stevekasian,2010-08-20T21:29Z,"Yeah, you can upload whateverthehellyouwant here at TPB, just like Muslims have a right to build a mosk at Ground 0, but logic and respect dictate otherwise. Use ur brain. It's freakin freeware. It ain't illegal. It ain't gonna get taken down. So why don't you just make your own damn website for all your freeware ""consolidation"" packages and post them THERE instead of HERE. Dumbasses, they never cease to amaze me..."
,raybob4321877,2010-08-21T01:24Z,"If you don't like it, then don't download it, and don't comment on it.  Leave it for the other 1000+ people that have downloaded my stuff in the past few days and seem to like it.  What have I used, like 15 kB of tPB's disk space?

This site is for all sorts of file sharing, not everything is or has to be illegal.

And FYI I too am against the mosque."
,Obama_bin_Laden,2010-08-21T04:26Z,you are ALL retarded
,fsxvzla,2010-08-21T07:56Z,"Ah, I inderstand raybob4321877 you are a retarded"
,KoktSvamp,2010-08-21T15:23Z,"Raybob Dont take any shit form these retarded trailer park trash.. they can all go and rot from where they came from.

youre torrents are simply amazing and they save millions of hours to the common person!

keep them coming and dont take any notice from these morons!!"
,razgriz_10000,2010-08-22T00:33Z,"Unlike all these assholes i actually thank you for putting together all these packages together. Like the posky 777 with all the liverys, that would have taken me forever to download. So again, thank you.

(btw guys he's right, torrents are meant to share anything, it doesn't have to be payware. So, if you don't like it, go outside and play a game of hide and go fuck yourselves :D )"
[T],stevekasian,2010-08-22T03:27Z,"No matter, you're still a bunch of dolts. lol"
,lostwallet,2010-08-22T15:48Z,"@karakorama and fsxvzla

[T],stevekasian,2010-08-23T04:26Z,"@lostwallet: I've got a German war helmet over here with YOUR name written right across the front of it.

BTW... You lost your wallet, fuck."
,Wolden91,2010-08-23T19:49Z,"If you guys don't like that he uploads freeware, then it's fine by me, but you don't have to complain about it. You don't have to download it. I would like to thank Raybob4321877 for doing a job that would have taken me a looong time, and i look forward to see more uploads from him!"
,lostwallet,2010-08-31T01:47Z,"@stevekasian nice, Love how im so famous that you put my name on it. Sadly its not my real name
go play with your toy solders you fucking door hore"
,razgriz_10000,2010-08-31T22:39Z,"@stevekasian lol that was one of the dumbest attempts at an insult ive ever heard...anyways since no one cares what you have to say why dont you go comment on your favorite video, you know, that one of the woman wanking a horse."
,raybob4321877,2010-09-02T01:34Z,"Guys, please seed after you download.

Seeding to a ratio of 10:1 is absolutely awesome and you would only have to upload 380MB to do it."
[T],stevekasian,2010-09-18T03:45Z,"@razgriz_10000: lol  It was funny - you just didn't get it cuz you were having a hard time visualizing your bed buddy, lostwallet, orally polishing my helmet. Hahahaha  And lostwallet was having the same trouble, as he couldn't stomach the idea of having anybody's dick in his mouth besides yours. But now you're together again, and can live happilly ever after as the homo lovers u are... So all's well that ends well, right? At least I got a nut off in the process. BTW, great job there lostwallet. Impressive. You've obviously had a lot of practice."
