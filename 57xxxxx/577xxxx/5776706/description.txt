Meant to include this in my MD11/MD80 package, but oh well.

Anyway, this includes a very good freeware model of the McDonnell/Douglas - Boeing DC9-50.  Includes lots of liveries, and very realistic flight dynamics as well as the FSX default 737 Panel.

Sadly, as this is a FS2004 native model, it didn't come with a VC and I can't import one from FSX, so for now, this does not have a Virtual Cockpit.

Seed please!!!
