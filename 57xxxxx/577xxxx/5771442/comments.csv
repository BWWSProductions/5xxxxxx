,ghayss_94,2010-08-19T03:58Z,thanks for the file dude but i saw another version a few days ago in DVDscr and i downloaded the sample it was very good but the torrent was deleted because it needed a password that was on a crappy torrent site but the meaning is that there is a DVDscreen copy of this film in some sites why it's not released here?
