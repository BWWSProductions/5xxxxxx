,IronPlane,2010-08-18T14:04Z,"Why is this episode so popular and the others are not?
Do people stop seeding after 1:1 and so only the most recent is populated or what?"
,rndyrddll,2010-08-19T05:24Z,"cant seed every episode forever, newer ones are gonna be more popular until someone posts the whole season when it is done"
,Online.Pirate,2011-08-12T12:47Z,"That's right.. the most current episodes will generally always have more seeds then older ones..

I find direct download is better for older episodes rather then torrent.. that way you don't rely on seeders"
