From their MySpace page:

Armed with an inspiring work ethic, a nonstop touring regimen and great songs, The Sunstreak have been bringing their own brand of infectious rock to the world since 2005. The Sunstreak, based out of Rochester, NY is comprised of Tony Rebis (Vocals), Jason Sarkis (Bass), Jack Flynn (Guitar/Vocals), Gary Foster (Drums) and David Schuler (Guitar/Synth/Vocals).

With the release of their self-titled and self-produced debut full length CD, The Sunstreak has hit the ground running since the Summer of 2006 on the Vans Warped Tour, selling over 25,000 records in 2 months and landing them on he Warped Tour compilation CD along with Saves the Day, Underoath, and Hellogoodbye. This relentless work ethic has lead them to be the second band in history to post on the Billboard charts without a distribution deal - Notably 33 on the Top Independent albums as well as 30 in overall Heatseakers. With the summer of 2009 just around the corner, and the release of their new album, Once Upon A Lie, approaching, The Sunstreak show no signs of slowing down. 

I got the CD when I went to Warped Tour 2010 in Detroit from Jack Flynn.
320Kbps. Enjoy.
