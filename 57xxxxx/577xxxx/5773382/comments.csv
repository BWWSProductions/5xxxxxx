Actually, one thing CAN be done and that is for people to keep seeding and not just download and go away, even if there are not that many people downloading.

Osho represents a very valuable material for all sorts of purposes and for everyone who feels in ANY way connected to him, just keep seeding, if for nothing else but out of gratitude for all those things you learned from him and all those eye opening things you realized as a result.

One interesting fact. I have observed recently that on some kill, kill type of game torrent there were 6000 seeders!!! And that is a complete garbage of a material, utter zombification type of thing.

Now, compared to Osho seeders that is about 1000 times better and that is among people who hardly care the others exist.

Quesion: Do people who are interested in knowing That Which Is there is less steam available and LESS support then between the zombies and biorobots?

Osho once said: out of 1000 people only one will get interested in investigating what IS, and out of those only one out of 1000 will go to the very end, and this is EXACTLY the proportions we are seeing here. Out of 6000 people seeding violence, only six are seeding consciousness.

Finally, yes, there ARE reasons NOT to seed, such as you don\'t like the material, you do not have access to computer and a few other reasons. But if you think of it, there is hardly a reason NOT to seed. It does not cost you ANYTHING. Just start a torrent program and use your computer without even bothering about it. It won\'t take your resources. You don\'t have to seed every Osho torrent out there. Just pick the ones you like or those that do not have enough seeders and take care of those.

Another interesting fact, just as expected, the people with high speed connections happen to seed the least. They just download it for themselves and go away in a matter of hours if not minutes. And those people with slow connections, who spend days and weeks to download one large torrent tend to seed the most. That is why download speeds are slow.
The guys who can afford it the most and who can contribute tens if not thousands of times more seem not to care for anything other than their own skin.

Remember this:
\""My way is the way of the HEART,
and not the way of \'perfect\' ...\""
[replace dots with your occupation]

I have seen plenty of people downloading at a rate of 8 megabits. If at least 10 of those were available your download speed would go up tens of times.

So...

Some people spend lots of time to make this all available with no conditions of any kind and you DID get the benefit out of it. Why don\'t you return the favor by contributing a little bit of your own energy and resources? What is so hard to comprehend?"

He changed his name after he was deported from the U.S., but his teachings are the same - dangerous and insane.  "
