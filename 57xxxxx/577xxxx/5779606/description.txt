The third of Joseph Arthur's quartet of EPs in 2008, "Vagabond Skies" probably is No. 2 so far, behind the very strong "Could We Survive" and a bit ahead of the imaginative sprawl of the more challenging "Crazy Rain." Stylistically, "Vagabond Skies" is close to the former, with really only one song possessing the blend of cacophony and musicality that "Crazy Rain" had. 

That said, this one's not as strong as "Could We Survive." "She Paints Me Gold," with Arthur trotting out the high vocals again, is a bit of a disappointment; I'd heard he'd been performing it live for a while, but it doesn't seem as if it would be much of a live grabber.   

Still, this is EP worthwhile, yet again. And -- again -- better than his previous full-album effort, "Let's Just Be." Keep on rolling along, Joseph.
