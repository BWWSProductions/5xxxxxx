@ penguin1-1 - I plan on doing the second season of Castle, though they will be TV-Rips, I hope that is okay.  I will do the Office S06 in a week or so, I hope you can wait that long, as I have several show request from people and I do not think I have any of the episodes from S06, so I will have to download them.

Anyways, enjoy and help me seed, cuz the more you seed the more torrents I can release faster. (^_^)"
