,Sneakybeans1,2010-08-20T05:38Z,"I can't find the Reloaded version of SC2, didn't even know they released a full version+crack of it yet."
,archphonix12,2010-08-20T10:47Z,works perfectly thnx:D
,marino74,2010-08-20T10:58Z,"i couldnt find it either, but i searched for it on google and the first link was sc2 reloaded on the pirate bay, try searching starcraft II (instead of ""2"") on pirate bay"
,marino74,2010-08-20T13:16Z,"FINALLY, this is great, works like a charm, seeding forever xD"
,kuleee,2010-08-20T15:21Z,works perfectly! where can i find more maps? i tried to put maps from beta but they don't work :S
,Godslayer187,2010-08-20T16:24Z,"Search google for maps, or if you want to make you own you can double click the ""Big game hunters"" map and it will boot the map editor up for you. Its a sneaky way to get the editor working without having to get another crack. I will post a map pack soon as well.


For those of you having issues finding the RELOADED version....here ya go : 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5767034/StarCraft_II_Wings_of_Liberty_-_RELOADED_%5BFULL_PC-GAME%5D"
,Godslayer187,2010-08-20T16:34Z,You can also get more maps when you load SC2ALLin1 click on the maps tab and choose load map from server. There is a hugs list of available maps for download. Just note it can take a min to load as the servers are really busy.
,Godslayer187,2010-08-20T16:52Z,Get over 1000 maps here:  http://sc2.nibbits.com/maps/
,marino74,2010-08-20T16:54Z,"godslayer187 can you upload maps?

HOW-TO FOR RETARDS:

1. download THIS torrent, then download this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5721469/StarCraft_II_Wings_of_Liberty-RELOADED

2. mount the reloaded image (.iso) and it probably wont autoplay so browse the image and start the installation (installer.exe)

ps - for mounting i use a free tool called ""magic disc"" so find that on google if you need to

3. during installation, a pop up window asking you to register will appear, press the ""skip"" button

4. as soon as the install finishes, an update window will appear, so close it before it begins updating, asap

5. now browse the image once again and enter the ""crack"" folder, once there, copy everything

6. paste everything in the ""Starcraft II"" folder (you'll overwrite several folders), located wherever you specified during installation, so try to remember where you installed it

7. now double click the update.bat (in the ""Starcraft II"" folder) 

8. now, paste all those files ONE MORE TIME, in the ""Starcraft II"" folder and overwrite everything

9.now go to the folder where you downloaded ""skirmish/AI cracked"" and enter the ""Razor1911"" folder, double-click sc2_copy.exe an let it do its thing

10. in the ""skirmish/AI cracked"" folder there is a file called ""SC2ALLin1_setup1033.exe"", you will need WinRAR or 7-Zip (free on google) to EXTRACT it.

11. hopefully you extracted it, so now you need to copy ""(8)Big Game Hunters.SC2Map"" in the ""skirmish/AI cracked"" folder and paste it in ""My Documents/Starcraft II/Maps"" and also paste it in the installation folder ""Starcraft II"" (the one where you used update.bat, remember?)

12. now go to that folder you extracted in step number ten, RIGHT-click on ""SC2ALLin1.exe"" and send it to the desktop

voila, so now you have sc2allin1 on your desktop, click it, adjust the settings and play"

,Godslayer187,2010-08-20T17:53Z,"I havent uploaded any maps yet myself, just the big game hunters one, but that site I listed has a shit load. Just FYI to everyone, some BLIZZARD maps have issues due to something blizz had done to them. maps that will work say SC2MAP, any with just S2MA or anything else probably won't work or will give you strange graphics like missing in game control panel.  that site again is http://sc2.nibbits.com/maps/

just stay away from blizzard made maps."

,CloWn_20,2010-08-21T20:06Z,"So will this work with any other version exept Reloaded? 
I have downloaded the digital download version.

Does it depend on the crack used or the version?"
