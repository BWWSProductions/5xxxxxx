[V],vtwin88cube,2010-08-18T16:31Z,I will seed as much as necessary to get this going real good.
,borgsten,2010-08-24T13:42Z,"Great torrent, thanks! Just too bad it's so slow. I'm on 10% now and my upload is twice as high as my download (""/) It's usually the opposite..."
[V],vtwin88cube,2010-08-24T17:04Z,"Borgsten -

Your welcome. There's not much I can do about the DL speed. If you really want this torrent, then hang in there :)"
,lostversion,2010-11-08T07:39Z,"Yeah, OK. I like Alice Cooper, used to listen to his radio show 'til I moved north. Excellent stuff. Still on the DL, but if it work I'll keep it on my seed list 'til my computer crashes again.

Message to downloaders: Free share is better than advertising. If you like it, help others like it. If everyone likes it, more people will buy it, and we'll get more great tunes.

Rock on"
,lostversion,2010-11-08T07:45Z,"FYI: my computer only crashes because other people have access to it. 

I have no doubt this is a legit torrent, or I wouldn't touch it. "
,gunghogungho,2010-11-10T20:16Z,"50 albums, 58 CDs, 709 songs, about 46 hours.

excllent torrent. well organized, perfect quality(listened to about half so far, zero problems)

definitely worth the DL. 

also worth seeding."
,raptorau,2010-12-15T16:18Z,"You rock my small, self centered universe. What an absolutely fantastic torrent - thank you so much! I will do what I can to help seed!"
,mandagaile,2011-01-12T10:30Z,wow! bravo on this discography! what more could one ask for?!
,BaronVonWatermelon,2011-01-13T09:34Z,"This looks great. Cheers, mate."
,boblaw023,2011-01-14T19:41Z,thx 4 this killer torrent
,lando242,2011-02-07T15:12Z,"Good release, high quality with lots of stuff. There are a few problems though:

The Muscle of Love track information is completely borked, every single title is off. Also, the Toronto and Science Fiction albums are bootlegs, and not even good ones. They are both from the same event (Toronto in '69) with incorrect track titles and some rearranging, so basically they are dupes. Plus two of the songs they featured aren't even by Cooper. I'd remove them if your going to do another release. Also quite a few dupes of existing songs from best of releases that shouldn't have been included. If the album is entirely made up of tracks that aren't unique (like a Fistful of Alice and HiFive) why have them on there?

Other than that its a quality torrent. Lots of great tracks on here."
,lando242,2011-02-07T15:52Z,"After going through all of the folders again I've found that 15 of them can be deleted as either being redundant (no new material) or bootlegs.

""HiFive"" is bogus album (not official) and redundant.
""The Best of Alice Cooper (2007) is bogus and redundant.
""Greatest Hits Steel Box Collection"" is bogus and redundant.
""Legends"" is also bogus and redundant.
""Spark In The Dark The Best Of Alice Cooper"" is the same deal.

""Price of Darkness"" is just a standard official compilation, no new material.
""Classicks"" is the same deal except for ""Fire"" but it appears in ""Life and Crimes"" and that a much better compilation album.
""Beast of Alice Cooper"" is more of the same.
""The Definitive Alice Cooper"" is nothing new.
Same with ""Mascara And Monsters"" which is its US release with a single extra (not new) tack.

""Nobody Likes Alice Cooper"", ""Science Fiction"", and ""Toronto Rock 'N' Roll Revival"" are all the same bootleg from '69 mentioned above. Crap really.

Finally there is ""School Days The Early Recordings"" which is just a double album of Pretties for You and Easy Action that Warner released after they took over Coopers contract It contains nothing new.

All in all I shaved over 2 gigs off this collection just by cleaning out cruft."
,audiojunkie2010,2011-02-22T22:41Z,Thank you so very much i promise to SEED for a very long time \M/ ROCK ON :)
[V],vtwin88cube,2011-03-12T07:31Z,"Thanks for saying thanks guys :)

And lando242, you're a dick. Why don't you just shoot yourself in the head & end your misery? Get a fucking life loser."
,sirneon1,2011-04-13T02:00Z,"Thanks to vtwin for posting this discography, and thanks to lando for helping the slow people actually get the original stuff without too much excess baggage. Looking forward to this!"
,zeus76,2011-05-05T19:30Z,"Impressed!!Thanks a lot,great job!!"
,lando242,2011-05-09T10:19Z,"@vtwin88cube

At least I'm not the one that fucked up the torrent. Chew my head off, sure, but fix your shit next time. I mean seriously, 2 gigs of shit bootlegs, dupe releases and bogus pirate albums. Wow. Did you even bother checking that shit out before you crapped it out or did you just download a but of garbage and throw it all in there like it was your own work? Theres no way in hell you ripped those CDs yourself without knowing that a THIRD OF IT was garbage. Least you could have done was check out his site to see what was even an official release. You're laziness and incompetence is substantial."
,tropicool,2011-06-02T07:52Z,"i think this is the third or maybe even the fourth Alice Cooper discography i've downloaded. each time i download a cooper discography something always seems to go wrong with the files. the last one i downloaded was great, but the quality was fucking hostile. then i discovered this torrent and was pretty amped to download it with the positive feedback and all. but what the fuck? payed attention to this torrent, you have not! every track titled on the 'muscle of love album' is off. now i love my cooper, but i have to say i'm not familiar with every single track ever made. there is so many albums, it's hard to keep up! so how the fuck am i supposed to know what's titled correctly and what's not?

plus.. over 1gb of this shit are either dupes or just unnecessary downloads. so i suggest to all future downloaders, pay attention and read lando's comments, unless you wanna waste 6.28gb of bandwidth to another garbage torrent!

i can't help but mention one of the comments that was posted above...

NO.. this is not a well organized torrent, in fact it's fucking far from it! more then half the albums are titled wrong. for example.. 'love it to death' was not released in 1970, it was released in 1971. 'muscle of love' was not released in 1974, it was released in 1973! this torrent is less organized then a field of hungry penguins with cold asses.

check your shit vtwincube, sort your shit out. your not rippin, your stinkin. suck a dick goodbye"
,fuckjews,2011-07-09T00:50Z,thanks for the upload
,arquemista,2011-07-11T21:03Z,Man TXS a lot for such a great torrent! excellent!

alice cooper rock on man. if i had money i would buy your stuff"
,terrence59,2011-08-09T15:24Z,Thanks a lot
,glomper99,2011-08-18T18:42Z,totally amazing!
,nickbob15,2011-09-19T12:35Z,"Don't know why, but whenever I try to add this torrent's files to iTunes, only ""Fistful"" is added."
,rafaelgirotti,2011-10-02T03:49Z,"Holy fuck!!!
Very very very very grateful :D"
,irj2,2011-10-15T01:17Z,"WOW! Gets my vote. Completeness rules over duplication/bootlegs.

A truly exceptional upload. 

Many thx."
[V],haggebull,2011-11-17T18:37Z,Thanks
,dave1954,2011-11-25T03:45Z,"Thank you for these albums, I've noted what others have said but I hope this does contain some bootlegs as I have long been a collector of bootlegs by the Doors, Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones and Prince but have not come across any by Alice before."
,jlukens,2012-01-04T07:59Z,"Wow.  I came here to download a few choice albums and then read the shitstorm of ingratitude in these comments.  I, for one, appreciate the opportunity to get free music.  I think there are a few here (looking at you, lando and tropicool) who probably shit on anything offered to them for free.  In my country, we call them cooks who work at Denny's.  Of course, every country has their own crappy diner-chain where misanthropic burnouts work..."
,jlukens,2012-01-04T08:04Z,"Sorry, vtwin88cube - I forgot to personally thank you for your efforts (must've taken a while).  Piss on the aforementioned ingrates for being a couple of world-class asshole whiners."
,F777,2012-03-17T13:53Z,"Just for you to know,i love Alice Cooper too much so i need to thank you much as i love Alice Cooper. Thanks,thanks,thanks"

,F777,2012-03-17T13:59Z,"@lando242 

We don't care about your ""shit"" you talkin'. We upload what we want and when we want. Some of us may love Alice Cooper,well expect some albums.... But We don't care if this is not ripped by us.Why are you in thepiratebay at all,if you don't like somebody uploaded ""not-his-albums"". So i think you should just shut the fuck up,or kill yourself. And before i end, FUCK YOU!"
,Kwnnan,2012-04-13T01:12Z,"Hahahahaha! While starts playing the song ""Shoe Salesman"" (from ""Easy Action"") suddenly enters the ""Mentira"" of Manu Chao!!! Haven't heard the other albums yet."
,Toxic-Saint,2012-04-22T05:12Z,Thanks buddy!
