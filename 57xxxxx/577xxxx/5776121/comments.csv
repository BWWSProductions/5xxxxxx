'namaste'

firstly, thanks a lot....

your work truly deserves appreciation....

ive followed your torrents for a couple of years now and to tell you the truth ive never come across anything this organized....

my respect!

tremendous effort...uve made life easier for a lot of people

well, uve asked if there are errors;
the song Shamanix from the album Twisted, of Hallucinogen from the first DVD pack is pretty fucked...

well let us know about what else you are working on right now and when you will update...

finally,
Om shanti and peace to you too!"
