ScottieB99: stated that the game DOES WORK with both ESR & HDLOADER.."
,otto_telfser,2010-08-20T13:54Z,thank you thank you thank you
,danielonthewall,2010-08-20T20:17Z,THE game works great..but no online play? Whats up with that?
,otto_telfser,2010-08-21T01:28Z,"someone uploaded it, but I think, and Im sorry if Im wrong, tthat the game uploaded isnt really madden 11 , but madden 10 with little changes, werent the players supposed to have things like swagger and other new stuff? they dont have these things, and when u start a superstar , the other rookies drafted are from the last year class"
,MoleP,2010-08-23T05:06Z,"I am gonna download it,
I'll let you know if it's good or dad.
Any way Thanks for the Up!"
,MoleP,2010-08-24T04:49Z,"It's working fine, But how it's could be only 1.34GB?
When the last Madden 10 bigger than this it's 1.52GB!
Any way it's working fine with my moded PS2
Thanks!  "
,CivicScootin,2010-08-26T01:18Z,"I guarantee you this is Madden 2011..

I dont know why the size is smaller nor do I know whats with the roster update..

Put it this way.. This is going to be the last Madden game out for the PS2 so enjoy.. 

I would suggest going to the next Gen for up to date rosters as well as online play (PS2 version of Madden does NOT include online play)

If I could edit the description I would..
In the mean time enjoy everyone,
Civic/Scootin"
,MoleP,2010-08-27T08:38Z,"CivicScootin is right about the game it's Madden 11 and it's the latest version for PS2. I found original disk yesterday and both disks are same size. 
So this is the copy of original one! 
Enjoy!"
,CivicScootin,2010-08-28T05:52Z,"@MoleP: 
Thank you for confirming this..

Guys I never try to to screw anyone over and the last thing Im going to do is screw someone over a video game that I upload..

Enjoy everyone,
Civic/Scootin"
,delilvr,2010-08-29T19:47Z,"hi, i downloaded this torrent and was wondering if i needed to have a certain program to run it or could anyone tell me how to get it on a disk plz help i'm new at this and i really want to learn  "
,CivicScootin,2010-09-15T03:29Z,"@delilvr:
Im sure you figured it out by now but if not use ESR Patcher to patch the disk.. Then run it via ESR (Google is your friend)..

If you have a modchip just burn with any burning software (I use ImageBurn)..

If you have a HDD on your PS2 just install the ISO to hdd by FTPing the ISO to the HDD (via Hard Drive Dump Helper) or use WinHIIP..

Remember that google is your friend on issues as well as tutorials on how to burn and play backup games on a PS2 system..

,countryboy_1709,2010-09-18T04:30Z,i downloaded this game and followed instructions on how to burn it but it didn't work. Can someone else inform me on how to burn an iso file and have work for a ps2. email me if you want and just put it in title. countryboy_1709@yahoo.com thank you would defintly like some more info.
,countryboy_1709,2010-09-18T06:30Z,aight ive tried so many different ways and still haven't got it to work yet. needing some serious help. no mod and no swapmagic just a ps2 itself. whats the damn secret.
,CivicScootin,2010-11-21T10:39Z,"@countryboy_1709:
I dont see what the issue is..
Any and all systems need to be modded in some way in order to play any burned or ripped media.. 
You ither need a modchip installed or have the system softmodded in order to play any ripped games..
Please do some research before you make clams on my uploads not working next time"
