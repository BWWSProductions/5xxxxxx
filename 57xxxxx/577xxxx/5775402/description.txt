Description:
Madden NFL 11 is the 22nd annual release in video gaming's longest-running and best-selling sports series. With a number of refined features, the 2010-released game aims to make play more accessible and efficient, without sacrificing the depth and flexibility valued by hardcore gridiron strategists. The new "GameFlow" system puts gamers in the position of the quarterback, suggesting suitable play-calls that can be quickly selected through a streamlined interface. By making it easier for gamers to immediately locate and select the most commonly called plays in each situation, the system can reduce the real time a full four quarters of football  takes, however, virtual coaches still have the option to pull up over 350 pre-designed plays, or to create their own. Following a trend in recent Madden games and other EA Sports titles, the default control schemes in NFL 11 rely more heavily on the two analog sticks, instead of multiple button-press sequences. Madden NFL 11 features all the contemporary arenas, teams, and players of the real-life league, including cover-athlete Drew Brees, quarterback and MVP of the Super Bowl 44-winning New Orleans Saints. The voices of Gus Johnson and Cris Collinsworth provide play-by-play and color commentary.
