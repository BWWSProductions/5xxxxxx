Homo faber (Latin for Man the Smith or Man the Maker; in reference to the biological name for man, Homo sapiens meaning man the wise) is a concept articulated by Hannah Arendt and Max Scheler. It refers to humans as controlling the environment through tools. Henri Bergson also referred to it in The Creative Evolution (1907), defining intelligence, in its original sense, as the faculty to create artificial objects, in particular tools to make tools, and to indefinitely variate its makings.

Homo Faber: A Report is a novel by Max Frisch, first published in 1957.

The novel is in the form of a first-person narrative, written by Walter Faber, a successful engineer traveling through Europe and the Americas on behalf of UNESCO. Fabers world-view based on logic and probability is challenged by his falling victim to a series of incredible coincidences.

The novel hits the reader hard as Faber meets each blow inflicted upon him by fate. It is one of the major postwar German language novels, which has received critical acclaim in its translations into other languages. It is a sharp satire portraying the contradictions inherent in the technocratic civilization of the West after World War II.

It has clear allusions to Sophocles Oedipus Rex. The series of hammer-blows inflicted on Faber by fate recall those inflicted on the heroes of Greek tragedy. More than most Greek tragedies, however, it employs irony which, combined with Fabers personal tragedy, are ultimately quite moving.

The Voyager, directed by Volker SchlÃ¶ndorff in 1991, is based on the novel.

It tells the fictional story of United Nations engineer Walter Faber, played by Sam Shepard, a man portrayed as devoted to saving the world through development of massive dams.

With a winding scenario that involves six countries, and a string of hokey Greek-tragedy coincidences, Voyager is doomed to easy derision and a small audience of European-film aficionados. 

Yet this adaptation of Max Frischs Homo Faber, set in the 1950s, has some appeal. To watch Voyager is to remember old-fashioned elements from the European films of that time, the then-exciting work of the Antonionis and Fellinis. International traveler Sam Shepard is sitting dejectedly at an airport contemplating something significant that has happened to him. In classic tragedy fashion, the movie replays all that has preceded this day. 

It is revealed early that he was involved with German Jew Barbara Sukowa in Zurich before World War II. But when she became pregnant, he dispatched her to have an abortion. They have not seen each other since. 

The story is easily predictable, so the less revealed the better. Shepard discovers his friend August Zirner (who has since married Sukowa) has committed suicide in South America, which leads him back to an ultimately devastating discovery. During his travels, he becomes emotionally involved with Julie Delpy (some will recall her from Europa Europa), a sirenish eccentric with whom he falls in love. A second meeting with Sukowa is also in the cards. 

As an Americanized version of Frischs erstwhile Swiss engineer, Sam Shepard is respectable for being effortless. His slightly goofy quality and one-sided knowledge of kilowatts and hydraulics help take the edge off his cover-boy features. Delpys intrinsic mystique (not her acting) suggests the mystery heroines of old art films such as La Dolce Vita.
