,RCM23,2010-11-23T00:36Z,"Can this be played on Windows Movie Maker?
Sorry if this is a noob question, i just started using torrents."
,neohotch,2011-02-19T01:08Z,"Excellent Quality for the size of the movie, itÂ´s definitely worth downloading and sharing. The English subtitles are embedded in the movie but can be hidden through software.  Thanks gunnersrock! IÂ´ll share a lot! "
,impulz101,2011-05-10T08:51Z,thx man i was lookin for a subtitled version of this film. no film is good when dubbed. thx again
,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-05-18T19:30Z,@impulz - if you read the release info it says the movie is in chinese with softcoded english subtitles. dont be so quick to judge - just open your fucking eyes and read. you really are impulzive. 
,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-05-18T19:32Z,before u go ranting  - just fucking with you impulzive. i'm very stoned and bored.
