Quality:

Audio - 9 (would have rated it a 10, but for some light echoing in a few places -but nothing distracting)

Video - 9+ (would be a 10 but for a few instances of 'this dvdscr has been water-marked...blah blah blah -to prevent piracy' text at the very bottom of the video.  It only comes up a few times though, and not enough to spoil the viewing experience)

As for the movie itself?  That is for YOU to decide. :) 

In my opinion [beginning of mile long explanation of my personal opinions on the twilight series], it is by far the best movie in the series , and seems to follow the book very closely (from what I remember anyway). The movie as a whole doesn't feel nearly as 'low-budget' as the prior two did. The actors seem to have matured talent wise over the years as well. 

I personally feel the writer, Stephenie Meyer tells a great story that captures a wide range of imaginations. I also believe with improved writing skills, but more importantly, improved editing, her stories would appeal to a much larger audience.  Her stories are awesome at capturing one's imagination. The style and quality of writing in which they are told, is an issue that will prevent more sophisticated readers from becoming fans and dedicated followers. An easy example of the 'poor' writing style I am referring to, is the very first paragraph of Stephenie's book, 'Twilight'. My then young teenage daughter had no difficulties understanding the paragraph. However, all of my adult friends and I,  who read the stories (to see what our teens were so crazy about), had to read it several times before we were able to figure out what was being said.  In my opinion, the writer is there to tell the story. The editor should make the story readable and coherent.  I have yet to come across a single reader who believes these books are well edited. It's a shame really. 

So Ms. Meyer, if you are reading this, give me a jingle. I will accomplish amazing results as a member of your editing staff. ;o) \

scenebalance, thank you for the awesome torrent. I loved the movie and will definitely purchase it when it becomes available to the public. :)
