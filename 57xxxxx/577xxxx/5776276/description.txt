PrisM NOTES:
Right ... sorry on delay on this one, been busy with work and things :P
anyway ... video is not to bad some faults here and there but nothing that was not fixable, lowered the chroma a touch to remove the tangy faces look, went onto the RGB colours lowering the red a whole lot, increasing the blue slightly, and a touch of green.
then was onto the brightness ... increased the brightness a touch to make those dark scenes a little more watchable, lowered the contrast to balance it out ... slight sharpness filter and some other bits ... ive watch half of this movie, it's easily watchable for those who wanna see it, subs are hardcoded in white, forgot to change to red :P
anyway sorry on delay sure some still want our version of it ;)

credit PrisM & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
