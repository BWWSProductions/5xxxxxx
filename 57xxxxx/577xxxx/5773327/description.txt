           Drawing on his unique background being half Irish and          
           half Korean, thoughtful comedian Steve Byrne delivers a        
           hysterical stand-up routine in which he cleverly explores      
           how race, music and sex influence our identities and           
           ideas of being American. Thanks to his limitless energy        
           and physical style, this successful showman has made           
           quite a name for himself on the road and through numerous      
           television appearances.
