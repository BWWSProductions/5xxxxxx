Mozart's operas were among his most sublime and accomplished compositions. He also wrote beautifully for wind ensemble. Just think for example of the Gran Partita for 13 Wind Instruments.

Here we have the two brought together in arrangements for wind ensemble played by the excellent Linos Ensemble of Don Giovanni, The Magic Flute, The Marriage of Figaro, Cosi Fan Tutte and Die EntfÃ¼hrung aus dem Serail.


Enjoy and Seed!!
