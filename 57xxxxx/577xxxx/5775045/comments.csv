[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-19T17:20Z,"@ htctouch - Yes, I read them. I will encode Vampires Suck in a few hours and will have it up in the next 24 hours. I just finished downloading Tom And Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes and will encode it in a hour or so, and it will be up in the next 24 hours. Tonight or in the morning I will download The Karate Kid 2010 & Paper Man and will upload it in a couple of days, I hope you can wait. I am currently looking for a good rip of Ong Bak 3 with Hardcoded English Subs, when I find a copy, I promise I will encode and upload it. (^_^)"
