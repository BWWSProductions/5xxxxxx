Japan had already tested it's own nuclear weapon and would have sacrificed many more of its own citizens armed with sticks and stones without the bomb and its ability to force a decision on the Emperor, let alone the potential suicide bombings etc. of allied soldiers. As for Vietnam I agree. But it was WWII that caused the formation of the military industrial complex that keeps wars flowing like piss from an elephant."
,sonofdog,2010-08-18T20:38Z,"Greed Corruption and Fear are the horsemen of the apocalypse that would have us in the stone age, for many that is already the case. The Human state can be either compasionate and good to stand up to these bullies with the truth, or submit to the evil imposed by these superwealthy corrupters and the minions they employ. Be careful you are not one of them, as many believe they are working for good but work toward evil in ignorance."

,sistromo,2010-08-19T01:50Z,"Sonofdog, Japan had already tested its own nuclear weapon? How ignorant can you be? It would most certainly do you good to learn a bit of basic history."
,sg71,2010-08-19T03:17Z,"Agreed. I don't know which history book you are learning from sonofdog but in the course I did on Japanese history at university there was no mention of a Japanese nuclear program.

Thanks again Phatwarez, you have been posting some very good docus. Sadly, in the country I am presently in all the NG, DC, and HC docus are over dubbed with cheesy Spanish and I refuse to watch them."
,Fantasm,2010-08-19T04:45Z,"Actually, both Japan and Nazi Germany were working on a nuclear program... However, the Japanese project was not very productive...  The U.S. simply got it done first... It was a very different world back then, the number of casualtie from just one beach landing were more than the entire Gulf War.... "
,tbird9183,2010-08-19T06:37Z,Fantasm is right. Both Germany and Japan were working on atomic weapons. As a matter of fact if the European war would have lasted a bit longer the US would not be the only that has used atomic weapons. Also towards the end of the war when Germany knew it had lost it sent materials and research to Japan to help them out with their program.
,tbird9183,2010-08-19T06:41Z,Alienking you are a fucking idiot! Do u think that dropping the bomb on a deserted island would change the minds of a people that were capable of committing suicide and kamikaze attacks? Not a chance in hell! They would have just laughed and wonder why we didn't drop it on Japan. They would have in a second if they had the bomb in their possession!

,sg71,2010-08-19T23:35Z,"I don't think America's primary reason for dropping them was ever to ""save lives"". They had a powerful new weapon and they were itching to use it for real. It wasn't necessary. They were on Japan's doorstep and would have defeated Japan soon enough. I suppose the only good thing to come out of it was that it showed the true horror of using these weapons. Too bad that lesson seems to be lost in recent years given all the nutbar countries trying to dive into nuclear weapons."
,Jim.Jimmy.Jr ,2010-11-05T12:40Z,"!!!!!!!!Actually there main reason for dropping it on Japan and not some empty island was because they knew what it did to a desert but they wanted to know what it would do to a fully populated city and those were almost the exact words of someone that was involved with it,


 if anyone remembers seeing what im talking about please speak up, it was an old interview of declassified military footage or still classified im not sure!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,Jim.Jimmy.Jr ,2010-11-05T12:47Z,"Oh and Japan actually surrendered 4 hours or 4 days im not sure just before they dropped the bomb and the states were aware of this but still needed to know what it would do to a city and this was there chance to justify it..   

It melted 80,000 completely inocent civilians in 0.63 seconds, these were not soldiers! this wasnt a military base, infact there might not even have been any soldiers in the city because they werre all stationed in bases. i cant believe what they did.


 Research that one and it will make you sick to your stomach no matter what side your on or where your from........... nuff said."

let's not forget that the U.S wasn't at war until the japs bombed and killed over 2000 SLEEPING american soliders on the morning of december 7. and that the japs never declared war against the U.S before attacking! so drop'n a bomb to end the bullshit they started is the way it goes when u start a war. the japs thought they were superior to every other country. but..... they were worng. "
,100bugs,2010-12-05T10:12Z,"All of you are WRONG!

The real reason why they dropped the bombs is because the USA had a very hard time getting the money required for ending that war the conventional way. 

At that time, the funding campaings in USA were very unproductive and the US dollar was extremely devaluated because they printed too mutch of it for funding the war.

It was bad to the point that Saudi Arabia (their oil supplier) was now requesting to be paid in gold instead of dollars.

Of course, they did not have that gold AND they needed that oil to defeat the japanese that were now fighting to death.

They desperately needed a way... 

The bombs were there so... they used it..."
,HardKn0ckLife84,2011-10-30T09:24Z,"Dude u need to shut the fuck up and do ur homework, Japan attacked pearl harbor while they were sleeping.

,HardKn0ckLife84,2011-10-30T09:26Z,That was to ALIENKING
,Lanark2,2012-03-27T12:34Z,"None of you know doodley shit!!!

The real reason Japan attacked Pearl harbor to begin with was penis envy! Well, that and also they were driven insane by the hula girl plastic dolls the Allies sent to them as a Christmas gift. But seriously, Japan had a nuclear plan in the works. 5 seconds on the GooGoo Machine will set you free. 

P.S.
Stay away from the Hulas you Haole!"
