The Deadwood Stage is comin' to town, bringing Doris Day and Howard Keel to fuss, feud and fall in love as Calamity Jane and Wild Bill Hickok in this entertainment from the golden age of movie musicals. At first curvaceous Calamity is too durned busy fighting Indians and cracking a bullwhip to pay much mind to such girlie what-alls as dresses and perfume. And Wild Bill is too danged busy wooing a dainty chanteuse to give a hoot about a hotheaded tomboy.

But things change in a rootin', tootin' big way, with love and romance just down the trail. There are wide-open Technicolor Western spaces, lots of high-stepping terpsichory and a hummable humdinger of a score by Academy Award winning songwriters Sammy Fain and Paul Francis Webster, who won an Oscar for the classic ballad (and '50's mega hit) 'Secret Love'.
