NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....The Twilight Saga Eclipse

Well heres our fixed up version with the ending intact.We had to rerip the vobs we were sent and done our normal stuff,changing
the brightness,contrast,rgb colours,sharpness etc...
Also we've had to crop this top and bottom due to balck borders but also more at the bottom to remove the counter and also two lots
of ID tags.Didn't need to crop too much off the bottom though to hide these as most were on the borders.
The video itself does contain a message saying that this source as had the persons ID added to this file....well for this we have left it as it
was already ripped with it in and spread across several public and private sites so ....and also we don't think that will be the way to track the 
person this came from.....also a big blur in the middle of the screen would look horrible.
Now our last release of this....hands up,we fooked up and made a mistake so sorry for that.
However whilst alot of users understood things like this can happen and was fine about it......there was alot of users on many sites that were 
completely out of order for what they wrote!!
There seems to be more ungrateful xxxxxxx now then ever,so please do us favour and STFU!!
No were not going on about users that wrote "ending is missing " etc....all comments like that were and are fine as your just stating the truth,it's 
all the other comments.
We like every other grp make mistakes and will do again,and i can savely say that because we ain't perfect nor claim to be either!!
We do this for nothing and ask for nothing in return .....this isn't our jobs and we have real lifes aswell you know.We do this for pure fun nothing more
nothing less ....yet some users must think otherwise  so please get a grip people.

Rant over and enjoy a FULL release this time round
