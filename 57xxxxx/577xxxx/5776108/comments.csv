The Bay has had some major problems since a month ago some @sshat did a SQL virus injection.  Alot of features either dont work at all or they work sporadically.  I couldnt post myself for almost 2 weeks.  All I can tell ya is hang in there til they get it sorted out.  More info on this can be found here...
