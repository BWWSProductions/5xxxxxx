I sure do hope that you're able to upload the 175MiB version of episode 18 as well; and if you're able to continue to upload the 175MiB versions of Degrassi, that would be awesome but I do understood if you're not able to do so.  So thank you for uploading all the 175MiB versions of Degrassi that you have done already.  Cheers :-)"
