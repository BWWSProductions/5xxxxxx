well! heres one for all you priest fans! this is a really good quality concert from the priest. it didnt have proper menu's and chapters. so i authored it with TMPGEnc Authoring Works 4. i think it came out just fine. but everbody has their input.

anyway, i cut out the long blackout beginning, the long blackout ending, and the long encore in between the songs painkiller and hell bent for leather. there were a couple of other glitches in between those 2 songs too. the loosing of sound and picture pixellated. so by taking the encore break out it took care of all that too.

so at the end of painkiller when the band is waving at the crowd, it will cut right to before the song hell bent for leather. so instead of a 5 minute encore break, theres is now only about a 10 to 15 second encore break. hardly even noticable.

so with that being said. rock on and enjoy the show!
