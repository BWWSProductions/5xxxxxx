    Documentary looking at the wildlife of the most            
    stunning mountain range in the world, home to snow        
    leopards, Himalayan wolves and Tibetan bears.            
    Snow leopards stalk their prey among the highest peaks.   
    Concealed by snowfall, the chase is watched by golden      
    eagles circling above. On the harsh plains of the         
    Tibetan plateau live extraordinary bears and             
    square-faced foxes hunting small rodents to survive. In   
    the alpine forests, dancing pheasants have even            
    influenced rival border guards in their ritualistic       
    displays. Valleys carved by glacial waters lead to       
    hillsides covered by paddy fields containing the          
    lifeline to the East, rice. In this world of extremes,     
    the Himalayas reveal not only snow-capped mountains and   
    fascinating animals but also a vital lifeline for        
    humanity.

     The BBC classify this episode as episode 4 of the         
     2010-2011 season, TVRage lists it as 29x18, but the      
     previous run from 2009-2010 season was S29 so this by   
     all rights should be S30, however this could all change  
     at a later date, as usual it's a mess, something else to  
     be aware of is not all episodes seem to air in HD with   
     this particular series.
