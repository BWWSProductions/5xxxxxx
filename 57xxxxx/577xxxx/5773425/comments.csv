,McfcDan,2010-08-20T02:16Z,"Not to put a dampener on this torrent, but for me it's taking ages to download. I can only download over night due to Virgin throttling my internet speeds otherwise, but I'm getting about 5K download speed on a 20MB line from the Bit Torrent client. Raymondhome is a very reliable user, but there's to many leechers in my opinion and this slows down the download."

,theRealKarmine,2010-11-10T13:29Z,twilight is for faggots and girls.  if i see any more oiled up teenage boys wrestling then turning into hairy beasts and humping like in the second movie im seriously going to start killing people.
,theRealKarmine,2010-11-10T13:31Z,and why the fuck would you need subtitles?  if you want subtitles go watch silent movies or learn fucking english and turn up the god damned volume.
,theRealKarmine,2010-11-15T00:42Z,if you are deaf.....read a fucking book.  you miss 3/4 of the movie because you are watching the subtitles and not the movie.
,theRealKarmine,2010-11-15T00:53Z,oh....but i guess that would be a good thing so you dont see the homoeroticism and bestiality.
,TiaTiara,2010-11-15T05:30Z,"For not being released on Dvd

Video is 9 because of the few letters on the bottom..which you forget about
