,FS_Junkie,2010-08-20T14:15Z,"Well ... I know, but if someone's prepared to compile freeware into handy packages then that's fine by me!"
,andy6000,2010-08-20T14:52Z,"please upload more russian aircraft for fsx, like 
tupolev,antonov,Ilyushin."
,raybob4321877,2010-08-20T17:59Z,"This site in my opinion shouldn't be ONLY for illegal stuff, if they can make it into a huge file sharing whatever site, that's great too.  Isn't the point of this whole idea everybody has to share more software and not have to pay for it?

By posting this I'm saving people time by compiling multiple planes into convenient packages as well as promoting Thomas Ruth's awesome freeware that he creates.  Win-Win.

So I say, why not upload freeware?  Perhaps people were having a hard time finding the Antonov.  I don't think there even is any payware for this plane, honestly."

,fenderico35,2011-05-15T00:21Z,"hey ! you can find these planes on RIKOOO.com site; easy to install (auto-installer) .
And for the visual problems , you should disable the DX10 option in FSX settings ."
