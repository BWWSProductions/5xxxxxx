Rx NOTES

Source: Twilight Saga Eclipse.mp4 [THANKS!]

Well THANKS to whoever put this online and to rok3r for the file!
Didnt do a lot to the video, sharpened, fixed AR and a couple other things.
Cropped the watermark at the bottom left corner. However there is an Anti-Piaracy Watermark that pops up every so often. It is a really nice screener and will definitely work until Retail is available. Enjoy!=]
