,atx-release,2010-08-19T22:19Z,"Don't botter, it is the same as all the copies around, the movie is 2h.12 mins but ends at 2.06 the rest are credits, it is the chinese BR release..

Cut scenes, censored etc"
[V],NLUPPER002,2010-08-20T01:52Z,"For now we must do it with this version.

Tell me where i can get the real uncensored edition and i upload it here.

The info is clear Run Time.....: 2:12:04

Till the uncensored edition  is available, Enjoy this version.
Everybody can play this version there is an AC3 and DTS audio stream in it only problem is its bigger than other version.

I am still seeding with 1.5 MB/s and have uploaded now 103.65 GB "
,UNISA,2010-08-20T13:49Z,"Hey NLUPPER
THANKS so much for the hard work in upping the hd BluRay torrents.

Ek kan praat in Afrikaans maar as jy die engels taal verstaan, dan sal ek in Engels praat.

I recetly dl'ed Shrek the 3rd 1080p. It has 3 Audio tracks, 1 namely Dutch in ac3
2 is English in AC3
3 is ENGLISH DTS

Audio 2 nd 3 are the full audio and i think its a waste of space with regards to audio track 2 as dts is better. the same space if possible could be used to increase the bit rate of the video or perhaps include a directors commentry. I say this Because almost everyone can decode dts and ac3 using Vlan or AC3filter.

All in all your ups are awesome"
[V],NLUPPER002,2010-08-20T16:26Z,"@UNISA

Not every body can play DTS thats why there is an AC3 extra in it.
Yes it is bigger that way, but here in the Netherlands we don't care about some extra  GB

Thanks for your nice comment"

,SkyNET84,2011-01-30T22:40Z,"I don't know if this has been mentioned, but it should be;

This is a CHINESE release, and therefore has had some scenes edited out and/or altered. A good example is the first fight scene in which Jaden Smith gets his ass whooped by the main antogonist in the movie. 

In this version, the entire fight has been edited out by comparison to the NA release.

I don't know if this is against posting rules or anything, so forgive me if it is, but for those who want the Region 1 BD release, here's a 1080p torrent of the Region 1 release.
