if you ( everybody ) look at a torrent and it has no screenshots or link to boxcover/official info about the file  google it or use imdb.com or wikipedia and copy and paste links to the info to help everyone else out ! please dont be lazy and expect the uploaders to do everything..do it yourself , the more people stop being selfish & expecting someone else to do this the better off well all be, the piratebay may not be around forever so help out right now !"
