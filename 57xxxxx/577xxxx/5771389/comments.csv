You need to accept Jesus, the Son of Elohim, born as a man who died on the cross to pay for our sins and rose from the grave on the third day. That 'll change your life."

Lets clear up a lie:
                                           Days    Nights
Fri - Saturday (Crucifiction)    1day    1night
Sat-Sunday (Risen?)              2days   2nights

""The son of man will spend THREE DAYS and THREE NIGHTS....."" [Bible]

Jesus DID NOT spend THREE days and THREE Nights in the tomb.

So, either the Bible is WRONG or the Maths is WRONG.

If the bible is WRONG, then the whole God story is FALSE,

If the maths is wrong, then Jesus WAS NOT THE MESSIAH!
