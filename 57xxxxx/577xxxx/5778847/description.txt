Liszt - The Complete Piano Works - Leslie Howard (94 CDs - MP3 @ 320kbps)


The complete music for solo piano of Liszt. All Liszt's versions of his piano music were included, including more than 300 world premieres, and many other pieces unheard since Liszt's lifetime, and also all arrangements of other composersâ€™ work including Beethoven, Mozart and of course Schubert. Four discs were given to Liszt's seventeen works for piano and orchestra, about half of which were premiÃ¨re recordings made from unpublished manuscripts. The series ran to 94 full-length CDs, and has earned Howard a place in the Guinness Book Of Records.


Leslie Howard (born 29 April 1948) is an Australian pianist and composer. He is best known for being the first and only pianist to record the total piano output of Franz Liszt, including the world premiere recordings of over 300 of Liszt's works. However, his activities go far beyond this project. He has been described by The Guardian as "a master of a tradition of pianism in serious danger of dying out".


There are, as I write, two other complete sets of these 94 CDs of Liszt's piano music on various torrent sites. One is mp3 at 128kbps and the other is APE with unfortunately several damaged files. This upload is mp3 @ 320kbps and is newly uploaded by myself after I downloaded it from thesite AvaxHome. Many thanks to the original uploader on AvaxHome. Those of you who are interested in a lossless version this has been uploaded to AvaxHome.



Enjoy and Seed!!
