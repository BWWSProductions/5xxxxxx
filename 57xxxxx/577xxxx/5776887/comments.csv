[T],ctang,2010-08-23T16:45Z,you said that when you tried to copy armageddon it was messed up at some place...could you tell me this place so i can check what i have copied...thanks  omegafox...i love this movie by the way!!!
,omegafox84,2010-08-23T20:42Z,i was able to get a copy of it but not able to get it back on my computer with the copy. the errors i was getting were a couple of the files towards the end of the disc. i'll run it again and see what the exact files were.
[T],ctang,2010-08-24T05:11Z,o ok...i thought it was a copy error...sounds like a general error or something weird...uploading it soon
