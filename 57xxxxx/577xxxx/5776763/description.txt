Westerberg's second solo release was an underrated treasure.  At this point, he had matured in to a songwriter who could still kick ass with the best of them, yet turn in some tremendous, powerful ballads.  Standout track has to be "Love Untold", a sentimental story of 2 lovers who were destined for each other and for whatever reason, never met.  It's one of many heart-tugging ballads, told only the way Westerberg could.  Immediately after "Love Untold", he kicks it in to gear with "Ain't Got Me" and "You've Had It With You".  These tracks show Westerberg has lost nothing when he's ready to kick you in the teeth with balls-out, rockin' numbers.  The only drawback to this record was how overly slick the production is.  If he could have maintained the grittiness of 14 Songs, with these tracks, Eventually would have been perfect.  As is, it's damn close.
