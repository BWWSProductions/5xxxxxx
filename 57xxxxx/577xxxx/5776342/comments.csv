People were/are like that also with the Simpsons.. thinking kids shouldn't be watching it.

As a child I always watched the Simpsons... now that I am in my mid 20's and watch the same old episodes again, I find them funny in a different way. As a kid they have one form of humor, and as an adult that's when you can see the other more adult side to the humor."
