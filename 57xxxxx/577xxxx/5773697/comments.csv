[T],prathaprabhu,2010-08-20T14:21Z,Well it is the very rate edition which you can't find anywhere in the Internet. If you are a windows collector then it is a treasure for you. :)

keys for sale? spam?"
,rajxprs,2010-09-06T16:40Z,"This is real fucked up... Most option is not available in this version,,, and where is the key?? I install it as trial... waste of time.."
,anydamnuser,2010-09-12T08:06Z,"Thank you.
I've been looking for the starter edition.
Is this ""untouched"" as well?
I already downloaded the SP2 version for my collection.
Now if I could just get my hands on Encarta.

As for the stupid commenters on this page,if you don't know what you are downloading and why,maybe you should just get off the internet."

[V],thethingy,2010-11-17T17:41Z,^^no its starter :) it just uses the home installer
,xerox20001,2011-03-13T04:46Z,i will seed this for windows collectors!
,PhoenixYT,2011-08-09T10:44Z,"Does it use the Windows xp Home istaller, because xp starter ist only sold as alredy installed copies on new computers?"
