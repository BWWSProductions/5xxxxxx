[InnocentHigh.com / TeamSkeet.com] Jessie Cox (Roses Are Red)


I really wanted Mr. Fitzergood to know how much I appreciated him so I snuck into his class and wrote him a nice hearth felt poem I had written. It went like this â€œRoses are red, violets are blue. I have a purdy pussy, and I think it likes you!â€ That was from my heart. Somehow I donâ€™t think my poem did the trick so I pounced on him and gave him a lap dance instead. That seemed to get his attention. I could tell by the way his tongue was in my purdy pussy.
