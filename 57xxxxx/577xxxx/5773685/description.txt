Folk albums are a dime a dozen so a lot of good ones get lost in the shuffle and remain unheralded. Thank God, First Aid Kit's debut album was not a casualty of the current musical climate of blog-about-it-and-forget-about-it. It garnered some genuine attention from the British press and I have read up on the band and they're still well regarded. That's nice. Two young Swedish girls playing folk and it's not undeserved. Their debut album is haunting. Their vocals are rich with earthy harmonies. They don't sound elfin in any way. They capture a humanity that is easier to relate to than the typical tweeness of fairy tale folk contemporaries. They sound like Eisley but more tempered, more disciplined. The songs are also quite lovely. Their sentiments are bound to the soil, suffering, romantic or otherwise, are believable. I almost don't want to know how young they are because without a visual reference, I can believe that they have been through it from the way the acoustic guitars trail the shadows of love and devotion and there is also a realness to the way their vocals soar and get back down to earth, to their bedrooms. This is music that could almost make the airwaves if the radio is not so intent on poisoning young minds with generic pap.
