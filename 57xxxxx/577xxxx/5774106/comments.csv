,crowangel,2010-08-25T00:14Z,Hi Seems to be problem with episode 3 in that you can't turn the subs off. You can with all the other episodes. also the disc size isn't the same as the other 4. Haven't checked to see if anythig is missing yet. Will update. All the others are great by the way. Thanks for the hard work.
,crowangel,2010-08-27T12:46Z,It's just the subs that are hardcoded onto episode 3 but nothing is missing.
