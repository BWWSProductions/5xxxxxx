Enjoy and please help me seed! (^_^)

I like this show! (^_^) I think it is good. (^_^) 

This show comes on TNT.

Show Nfo - A PG-13 version of The Shield. - The show centers around Lt. Shaw\'s (McDermott) undercover unit, comprised of himself and two other cops, Curtis (Hardwick) and Bendis (Marshall-Green). Along the way, Shaw recruits a bright-eyed street cop with a dubious past, Allen (Aycox). The unit walks the line between committing felonies that could land them in jail for a considerable amount of time and nailing the criminal enterprises they have infiltrated.

The writing is sharp, if a little predictable when it comes to the \"Federal Bureau of Intimidation,\" but the show works.
