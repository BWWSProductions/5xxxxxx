,foolhill,2010-08-21T00:40Z,"I said before on the subeject pf .mobi: right, it\'s an annoying file type. You can convert on this site: http://www.convertfiles.com/ You just fill in the form, then upload the .mobi and download the result. Warning: the conversion to pdf is not perfect, as text the result is better

ps: there is also a .zip with the same name (don't know what type that contains after unpacking)
