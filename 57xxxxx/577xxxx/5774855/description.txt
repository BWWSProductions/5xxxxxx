Plot.............: Alper is in his mid 30s and a good chef at his own restaurant. 
He loves luxury and spends his life with one-night stands and paid love. One day, 
his life changes utterly as he walks into a second-hand shop where he first 
encounters Ada who is in her late 20s and has a shop where she designs costumes 
for kids. She leads a modest life and one day while looking for a book, her and 
Alper's paths cross. Alper is fascinated by Ada's beauty and starts following her 
with the book she has been looking for. They both experience first signs of love, 
which they have never experienced before. Although Alper tries to fit Ada into his 
life, he realizes that this narrows his life down while on the other hand Ada has 
already fallen in love with him. 'Issiz Adam' portrays the life of those whose 
lives have been isolated by modern lifestyles. The film is also filled with food, 
mothers, old songs, and love.
