[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-11-14T23:04Z,"Portuguese to English translation of the summary  -

In a museum in Washington DC two Secret Service agents Bering Myka (Joanne Kelly) and Peter Lattimer (Eddie McClintock) conflict on planning a presidential visit. Myka is extremely organized, hard, while Peter is more flexible and responsive, trusting your instinct. A curator cut your finger with the teeth of a crystal artifact stone head and is possessed by a spirit and out of itself, attempts to attack the president. Peter and Myka neutralize the situation and are transferred to the warehouse in the middle of nowhere and then the adventure begins. Check out the movie that led to the successful series."
