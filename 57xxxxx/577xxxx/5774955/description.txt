Alpine Linux is a community-developed operating system designed for x86 Routers, Firewalls, VPNs, VoIP and servers.
Alpine Linux is and always will be free of charge. You do not pay any licensing fees. You can download, use and share Alpine Linux with anyone for absolutely nothing.
Alpine Linux was designed with security in mind. It has proactive security features, such as PaX and SSP, that prevent security holes from being exploited.
Alpine Linux uses the uClibc C library and all of the base tools from BusyBox. These are normally found on embedded systems and are smaller than the tools found on GNU/Linux systems.
