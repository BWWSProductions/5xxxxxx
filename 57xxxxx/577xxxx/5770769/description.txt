           A female music professor, mother, and wife (for the            
           second time) begins to experience severe depression and        
           we come to find out that there had been a past episode         
           that resulted in her divorce from her first husband and        
           her daughter when she was very young. We get to see the        
           current impact of depression with her second husband, its      
           impact on her now 13 year old daughter. There are scenes       
           of medical and psychological intervention, her                 
           befriending a music student (with a past) both as a            
           professor and later as companions who support each other.      
           There is ultimately the professors having to make              
           difficult decisions regarding her decision, her                
           treatment, and resolution of her relationship with her         
           husband, daughter, and now her female friend with mixed        
           results.
