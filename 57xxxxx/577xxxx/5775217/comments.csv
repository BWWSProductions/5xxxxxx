,oldboy49,2010-08-20T21:16Z,Serial??
,LER903,2010-08-20T21:23Z,"For the Serial see description or included text file.
Regards"
,oldboy49,2010-08-21T11:55Z,"Sorry, but those numbers are for activation, not the serial for the program Jeppwiev.

The serial should be in the format MTV-78U-XX9."
,oldboy49,2010-08-21T14:22Z,"Anyone got this to work?
I can start setup on disc 1m, but then when I start disc 2, as advised, it looks for Jeppview, which is not included on the discs, as I understand."
,LER903,2010-08-21T16:46Z,"Hi oldboy49
Like it says in the description this is ONLY the most recent Jeppview Cycle 1016 this is not the main or base program Jeppview 3.
If you need the base program give me a request and i will upload it.
Regards"

,oldboy49,2010-08-21T18:26Z,"Ok, sorry ;)

You need to install jeppview 3.5 first then do not install cycle 1016 yet,...... first install cycle 0901 so that you can use the old key (r00d-kcab), then activate with old key..... after that you can install cycle 1016.

to benoni1
You need PowerISO program so that you can mount disc 1 & 2 and from there you can install using the setup program for the cycles.  Remember that you cannot install these cycles directly..... You would always use PowerISO to mount these updates. "
,epa2810,2010-09-03T12:30Z,"Thanks warloot!!

Well, I've now installed 1016, but I have to change the time zone to +9... any other solution? maybe a patch or a fix or something like that. I don't like my pc having the wrong time :D"
,warloot24k,2010-09-23T03:46Z,"Cycle 1019 here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5846464/Jeppview_1019"
,warloot24k,2010-09-30T03:39Z,"Cycle 1019 is out already..... I uploaded it in demonoid.... try it... seed it.

If you do not have an account, just ping me here and I will be happy to send you one.

Enjoy!"
