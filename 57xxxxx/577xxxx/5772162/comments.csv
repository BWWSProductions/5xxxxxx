to substitute_1.. will this be your usual upload time? 2 days behind the non 720 uploads? Anyway thanks a lot.. am very happy with this one."
,rjamesbe,2010-08-18T18:39Z,my up is 260kb and my up is 5kb.. what the fuck?
,substitute_1,2010-08-18T19:03Z,"rjamesbe, I did this the first and hopefully the last time. My internet connection is too slow to upload torrents. I just knew that everyone is waiting for 720p and when I found it on the net i thought I'd try, but it apparently wasn't a good idea... I promise I'll seed it this time, but you'll have to be patient."
