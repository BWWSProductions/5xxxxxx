Isn't it possible to have audio 5.1? Just asking. I am not sure whether BBC have int 5.1."

,OlinaDeLaHoya,2010-08-21T10:49Z,"To all !

There is noting wrong with the seed, the big problem is with the upload, they most upload it again for it to work, until then nobody will be able download it.
TvTeam released several torrents on the 17:e and 18:e and this problem is in several of them.
I really hope they release this torrents again !"

Don't understand what you mean that it's a problem with the upload, should I give up with this torrent?"
,OlinaDeLaHoya,2010-08-22T22:41Z,"Yes, there is not a chance that you will be able to download this torrent, unless somebody manage to repair it.
I hope somebody re-upload it again...soon"
