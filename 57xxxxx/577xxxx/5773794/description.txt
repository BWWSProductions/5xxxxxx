From Footballer Support.


Information on \\\"His Legs Have Gone Syndrome\\\" which effects 

athletes in Action Sports such as Football, and Power Sports such 

as Gymnastics, and also effects \\\"The Bounce\\\" in Boxers.

Once though of as \\\"The End Of The Career\\\", this is no longer 

the case, and adequate solutions and work-arounds now exsist to 

solve the problem, or keep it under control, taking 10 to 14 days 

depending on the age, physical condition of the player, and how 

long the syndrome has been allowed to develop plus any other 

ageing issues that may be effecting performance in the 

background.


Most people in most sports still consider it as the end of a 

career. What is technically called \\\"Re-Setting the Re-Set\\\" can 

prolong a career for up to 10 years in the field of Football 

(Soccer) and some 3 to 5+ years in most other sports.

The information covers details of the syndrome and the various 

options there are to providing a solution or a work-around to the 

problem.

concerned about this issue. There are no charges. All enquiries 

are dealt with in the strictest confidence. Links are included

problem for you if they understand the process and are willing to

effects on your future career when the club finds out, Footballer

problem via phone, email and for players within travelling distance of West London,
