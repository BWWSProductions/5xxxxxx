NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....The Twilight Saga Eclipse

Well here we are with a nice DVD Screener of Twilight Eclipse. Now we had the xvid that was released onto demon 
yesterday, but before that was even finished downloading we we're sent the 
original dvd vob's by a good mate... Cheers mate you know who you are... 
On to the video, its a very nice scr so we just needed to do a few touch up's on it. First 
we cropped of the timer and watermark that was on the bottom which was not much at all so 
nothing will be missed, then it was just a matter of a few rgb color changes and a few other 
small things. The audio is very nice AC-3 audio for a nice crisp sound. All together this is a
nice release.

Enjoy...
