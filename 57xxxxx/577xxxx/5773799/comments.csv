,Zinedane,2010-08-19T18:28Z,Only me that wonders why there are already 6 seasons released and these torrents are named season 5? :P I know it's the new episodes but why isn't it season 7?

because so many people labeled it all wrong. This is in fact season 5. Last season was not 6, but actually 4."

Previous torrents labeled as season 6 are wrong. Current season is 5. Previous season was 4."
