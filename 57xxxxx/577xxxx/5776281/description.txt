An all-star cast has a viciously fun time in this comedy about lazy would-be thief Michael who owes local gangster Perrier more money than he can pay. When a burglary to raise funds goes awry, Michaels lovesick suicidal neighbor kills one of the goons who come to collect and he is forced to go on the run. Dragging along his neighbor- not to mention his foul- mouthed, death-obsessed father Michael has to stay one step ahead of the crime world while keeping his dad one step ahead of the Grim Reaper.
