Release Notes:
Right....sorry on delay on this one, been busy with work and things , anyway....video is not to bad some faults
here and their but nothing that was not fixable, lowered the chroma a touch to remove the tangy faces look, went
onto the RGB colours lowering the red a whole lot, increasing the blue slightly, and a touch of green. then was onto
the brightness...increased the brightness a touch to make those dark scenes a little more watchable, lowered the 
contrast to balance it out...slight sharpness filter and some other bits....ive watch half of this movie, it's easily
watchable for those who wanna see it, subs are hardcoded in white, forgot to change to red , anyway sorry on delay
sure some still want our version of it
