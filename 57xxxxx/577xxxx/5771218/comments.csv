[T],bulletzz74,2010-08-18T22:48Z,KaPiTaL SiN does have a site but they don't give you links to download their games.
[T],bulletzz74,2010-08-19T06:31Z,KaPiTaL SiN's website http://www.gamefenix.com/

[T],bulletzz74,2010-08-19T16:56Z,@parrot2  what are you talking about
[T],bulletzz74,2010-08-19T18:29Z,"parrot2  NO ONE is talking about Kane and Lynch 2,this game is STRANGLEHOLD  so please go troll somewhere else."
,parrot2,2010-08-19T19:06Z,"Troll? maybe you misunderstood
I'm talking about KaPiTaL SiN\'s website, is NOT gamefenix, just follow the pastebin, there it's the real KPS website.
Just this, not trolling."
