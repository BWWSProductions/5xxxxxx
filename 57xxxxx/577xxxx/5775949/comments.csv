That is all."
,henry76,2010-08-24T10:35Z,Thanks bone :)
,NitLions,2010-08-24T22:57Z,"the audio is waaaay off on this too. U hear the audio and then see their lips move after, it gets really annoying. Its not like its just a tiny off, its enough that it makes the movie unwatchable. Look for another copy, sorry BONE but its true. No reason to waste people's time. Thanks anyways for the effort"
