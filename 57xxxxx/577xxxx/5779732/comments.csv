I have checked 3 of the torrents you recently uploaded, and none of them appear to be active... in other words, nobody is able to successfully connect and download from you.  I think it's just a matter of properly setting your torrent client to seed the torrents you have uploaded.  Make sure your client is up and running.. and each of the torrents you uploaded are activated and set to seed.  

Just say the word if you need further instruction and I'll help if I can. :) (or you may want to click the link at the bottom of the page and visit the pirate bay forum for more detailed instruction.  good luck... I hope you get it figured out! :)"

,EZ123,2010-08-21T23:07Z,"ok now i am seeding all of my uploads, but how to i make the upload speed quicker, the highest one is uploading at 5kb . i have the upload speed set at unlimited but they are all uploading slow, is it due to everybody leeching them?"
