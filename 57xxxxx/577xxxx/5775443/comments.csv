very high quality;

,deputymonike,2012-07-03T15:07Z,I'd really appreciate it if we could get a few seeds. Looks like I'm not the only one waiting in line for this. Been stuck at 98% for a few days & it looks like I have at least a week left. I sure would be grateful to whoever has the throughput to spare. ty.
