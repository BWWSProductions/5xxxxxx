,zdude555,2010-08-18T09:01Z,"Oh lemme be the 1st one then to once again comment on the stupidity of uploading RAR files instead of single AVI. ""People tend to seed AVI file more than RAR's simply because they can watch & seed simultaneously while RAR files (once extracted) just sit & hog space. Most guys delete them then thus killing the seeding""

Split-RAR's KILLS the seeding.

Thanks Sam. But downloadin from the single avi torrent."
