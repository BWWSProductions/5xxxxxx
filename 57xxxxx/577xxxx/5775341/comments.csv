,SmudgeTheCat,2010-08-21T03:05Z,Day 2 of the same message.  No problem with other torrent downloads. Anybody else?
,potebonde,2010-08-22T13:22Z,No specified file found â again!
,SmudgeTheCat,2010-08-24T06:42Z,If someone is monitoring this it might be a good idea to either fix it or delete it.  It's been like this for over three days.
