I found the subtitles of the widely available version of the "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" hard to follow as there were a large number spelling and grammatical errors and the translation in some parts was very unclear.
I then downloaded a better version of a subtitle file from a subtitle site made some minor editing changes to correct some minor spelling and grammatical errors and tweaked some parts of the translations to make their meaning clearer. I reinserted the revised subtitles in this version of the movie. The subtitles and movie are at 25,000 fps for the experts.
I have based my spelling and grammar on US English rather than UK English as the former is more widely used and accepted.
I wish to acknowledge the extensive and time consuming work undertaken by those who uploaded the original movie and subtitles. I hope you enjoy this excellent movie as much as I did.
