,PhiberOptix,2010-09-08T22:39Z,"""SOLT - Kto ona?""
""SALT - Who is she?"" (""who she"" literally)
Russian is easy to learn really. I think it's harder the other way around because English is a more sophisticated and a higher class of language."
,Slakpad,2010-09-10T22:40Z,@phiberoptix: seriously? russian belongs to the same language family as english (indo-european). ever since they split up they've had the same time to develop to their current form. saying onyone of both is more sophisticated or of a higher class is plain stupid
,blazzox,2010-09-16T20:15Z,"@PhiberOptix russian is harder then english.... its part of the sloven language which also include serbian croatian macedonian polish.....
russian has all the thing that english have, and a few new forms of verbs... i studied it at school, its very complicated...... 
anyway .. there is a best relese so far made by raymondhome.... its r5!!!"
,Sarkasmi,2010-10-10T11:19Z,"Russia ISN'T easy to learn. I mean I couldn't even read the text as ""Solt - Kto ona?"" like phiberoptix said.. It reads more like ""COAT - Kto Oha?"" to me.


Just saying. 

And SOLT? Is that Salt, pronounced by a British person? ;) 

Angelina Jolie is overrated.

*trollface* (*runs away*)"

Everyone above this line was trolled"
,midurix,2010-10-22T15:21Z,"The line above is the actual size of Spedrickk's penis, true story!"
,RyuuShinobi,2010-10-23T19:53Z,"The movie is actually originally English, this is a Russian Dubbed version. if you want English search for ""Salt"""
