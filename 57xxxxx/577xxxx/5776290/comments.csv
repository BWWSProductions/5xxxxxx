,llamanana693,2010-08-20T14:15Z,"The file plays fine in VLC even though it's only downloaded 99.9%.
Apparently, deliberately damaging a single byte of a file after it's been hashed by the seeder is a way that some seeders use to ensure that nobody can complete the torrent for a few days, keeping the swarm fairly big. Leechers downloading the file fail the hash check on the last piece even though it is has actually downloaded correctly, since the seeder is sending out incorrect data because they intentionally corrupted the source file slightly. After a few days the seeder puts the file back to how it should be and then eventually everyone manages to complete the torrent.
I would still download the torrent since the file DOES work even though it's not 100% complete, but I'm disappointed that such a well-reputed seeder would use such underhand practices to keep the swarm going."
,AgentOfChange,2010-08-20T15:00Z,I can confirm it played fine with VLC.
,Cataclysm75,2010-08-20T16:03Z,Somehow all torrents I grab from TvTeam die off... The Deep 1x03 720p is dead too... I will avoid torrents from them in the future...
,awmanke,2010-08-21T03:43Z,Thanks for the info llamanana693
,eagertestical,2010-08-25T01:26Z,"Cataclysm75 that's because you are slowly getting banned from lots of IPs because you leech too much.. If you have a higher seed ratio you will get better speeds from trackers ;)
