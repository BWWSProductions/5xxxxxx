     SUMMARY:
              After taking a look at this week's cases, the team
              decide to investigate a phenomenon called the Paulding
              Lights in Paulding, MI, a mysterious glow that people
              say is cast by the lantern of a ghost of a railroad
              brakeman. In Texas, Ben, Chi-Lan and Larry get to the
              bottom of a legend wherein the ghosts of children
              safeguard passing cars from being hit by a train.
              According to the legend, these children, killed
              themselves by a freight train, push cars up a hill and
              over train tracks to safety, leaving their
              fingerprints on the trunk of the car.
