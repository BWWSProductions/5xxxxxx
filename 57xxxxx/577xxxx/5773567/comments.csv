Kps Note:
Remember if you rip something from the game like 24 audio tracks in the video the tag it's ''RIP'',Repack it's when the game has all data like the original with lossy or lossless compression.

Or if you Rip a INTRO or LOGO ..Still a RIP!!!,NOT A REPACK, OF COURSE FORGET THE LAME NAME ''FULL-RIP''

,SuperXero89,2010-10-11T21:19Z,"For those of you who have gotten this game to work, are the voice overs missing?

Also, for some reason I cannot seem to make it to the base after the free fall at the very beginning of the game.  No matter what I do, I'm always about 450 meters short, and I never had that problem in any other version of the game."

,VampireKitty,2010-10-24T10:01Z,"Not working for me... I installed the game in English and when I click the game file nothing happens, except steam files appear...
Somebody already wrote this before me and said that it helped changing the language registry, how do I do that?
I know with most games you open regedit, find on the software list and change the language, but I can't seem to find this game on the list so there must be another way?"
,cool121,2010-10-26T13:31Z,great. game works
,royhere,2010-10-30T12:30Z,"pls upload shank pc game,......"
,allwin55,2010-10-30T19:18Z,"hey BULLETZZ74 u told u will upload some games wht happened to u , u didn't upload any game for a long time. ur rips are awesome and working."
[T],bulletzz74,2010-11-01T08:31Z,"I said i would upload more games but shit happens and now i can't.

If you wanna get the rest of the games i said i was gonna upload and many more(rips or repacks) visit Kps website http://www.gamefenix.com/home/

All you have to do is register but it's worth it cause right now you can download games like Los Planet 2(repack),PES2011(rip),NBA2K11(repack),Dead Rising 2(repack) and many more.

All you need to download the games from kps is Emule

Again i'm sorry for the people that waited."
,Pundemic,2010-11-07T03:35Z,"Heya. First, thanks for the torrent.

However, I'm having some problems with the controls. The game appears to run fine, but when I first started it all of the keybindings were blank. I went through and configured them all, but the game doesn't allow rebinding of certain actions. 

Because all keybindings were somehow blank by default, the actions which can't be rebound have no key associated with them and no way to bind them to a key. I've also tried using the Xbox 360 controller, but it has the same issue: all of its keys are unbound by default, and the game offers no way to bind ANY of them.

Anyway, I'm unable to play the game because of this. I get the impression no one else has had this problem. Any advice, anyone?  "
,_bismuth,2011-07-03T02:56Z,"Does not work. Windows 7 x64

Unrared. Ran setup_en.bat as instructed with admin priviliges, made sure nothing was blocking it too. Command prompt pops up with some text in spanish. Window closes. It is asking to press any key and I do. The window closes. Very interesting..."
