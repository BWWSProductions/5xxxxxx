The Orpheus crew's quest for renewable energy has led them into danger. 
They're trapped on Volos, a Russian submarine, and its nuclear reactor 
is dangerously overheating. Whoever shuts it down will be exposed to lethal 
radiation. Who will draw the short straw? Meanwhile Clem is determined to 
find out what part the Volos had in his wife's death.
