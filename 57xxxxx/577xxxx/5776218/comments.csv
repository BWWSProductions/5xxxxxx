,zeitgeistmandvdrip,2010-08-20T20:48Z,"i agree its stuck on 99.9% my utorrent is full of files from tvteam that wont complete !

if you ( everybody ) look at a torrent and it has no screenshots or link to boxcover/official info about the file  google it or use imdb.com or wikipedia and copy and paste links to the info to help everyone else out ! please dont be lazy and expect the uploaders to do everything..do it yourself , the more people stop being selfish & expecting someone else to do this the better off well all be, the piratebay may not be around forever so help out right now !"

,pixiesmiles,2010-08-21T03:27Z,"Like others have mentioned, this torrent is stuck at 99.9%. Only the AVI file is downloading.. the other text files are not (no loss there).  Don't let the 99.9% prevent you from downloading though... the avi file plays perfectly in media player and VLC Media player.  

There must be some glitch either with encoding, or in the torrent creation that is reporting false file size or preventing a complete download. But as I said, it is not affecting video quality... nor does there seem to be any missing chunks of video.  So, in my humble opinion, download with confidence, as per usual! :o)

Thanks TvTeam, for all that you share. I cannot even begin to tell you how much my family and I appreciate your efforts here on pirate bay.  

cheers!"
