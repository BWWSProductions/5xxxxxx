I love this series"
,Moondoggie,2010-08-19T10:58Z,Stuck at 99.9% Original seed doesn't seem to be available but will keep torrent running till he returns hopefully.
,timmiej1993,2010-08-19T13:53Z,"Gets stuck af 99.9% just like at moondoggie's.
I'll wait it out for a while, but it would be nice to get the orriginal seed back up."
,OlinaDeLaHoya,2010-08-20T07:47Z,"This newly released torrent's is impossible to download, can you release it again thx ?"
,timmiej1993,2010-08-20T13:48Z,Still stuck at 99.9. getting really frustrating now.
,RyuUchu,2010-08-20T16:38Z,Also stuck at 99.9%.  Would be nice to get the original seed back up so I can finally finish DL and be able to watch it.
,natenkiki2004,2010-08-20T22:51Z,To everyone saying they're stuck at 99.9%. DUH. Everybody is. No need to state the obvious and complain. Make a pleasant comment asking the uploader to fully seed. I tried another new TvTeam torrent and it didn't have any seeds either. I'm thinking something is FUBAR on their end. I'll stay connected to this torrent until either it's seeded or another 720p is uploaded.

Everyone stuck at 99.9, try playing it in VLC. You'll see what I mean."
,Moondoggie,2010-08-21T04:12Z,Hey guys. I ended up giving up on this one and went to the http://www.torrentday.com/ site and downloaded it from there. Completes from that site but unfortunately it's in rar format so had to start fresh.
,OlinaDeLaHoya,2010-08-21T10:50Z,"To all !

There is noting wrong with the seed, the big problem is with the upload, they most upload it again for it to work, until then nobody will be able download it.
TvTeam released several torrents on the 17:e and 18:e and this problem is in several of them.
I really hope they release this torrents again !"
,a6200224,2010-08-21T11:11Z,"DLing this at the site mentioned above. Hopefully, I can extract and fix this torrent."
,a6200224,2010-08-21T11:43Z,"ok, I got the first chuck recovered and seeding now. The video should at least be playable in vlc now."
,a6200224,2010-08-21T23:53Z,I decided to take a stab at the last chuck. The poster converted the nfo file from the rar pack to a unix encoding (i.e. deleted carriage returns). I just needed to convert it and rehash the torrent. The entire torrent should be good to go.
