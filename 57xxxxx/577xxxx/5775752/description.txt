Ha Hui and Lin Hai: Crying Ospreys


Singer Ha Hui describes this project as "Post classical Folk Opera." OK... well, as student of
Quyi (traditional Chinese performing arts), Jingju (Peking Opera) and Kunqu Opera... I must admit, I just don't hear it!
However, what she and popular New Age composer Lin Hai have created is a really lovely, sophisticated take on
contemporary pop song.  

Beginning her career as a traditional folk singer (in the mode of Peng Liyuan and Song Zuying) Ha Hui first came to
national attention in China with a disc of patriotic songs called "Hello Xiaoping." Several years later, she completely
redefined her style and is a present marketing herself as "Helen Ha" and calls her musical stylings "Chinese New Ceremonial Music."
Whatever...

The title track, "Crying Ospreys" has been making the rounds ongives a good idea of what to expect.

The real star of of this disc is a collection of 11, really beautiful songs composed and arranged by Lin Hai, set to classical Chinese
poems. 
The package includes all 11 tracks, cover art, and two booklets (one with songs lyrics, the other a bio of Ha hui)
