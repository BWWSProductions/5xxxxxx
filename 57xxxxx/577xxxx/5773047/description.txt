26 men are chosen to participate in the roles of guards and prisoners in a psychological study that ultimately spirals out of control. $2,500 for two weeks, it is easy-earned money. The study examines aggressive behavior in an artificial prison setting. At first the tenants are divided randomly into prisoners and guards, but soon a spiral of violence begins. When the professor and creator of the program leaves the project for a short time, the experiment escalates. This is the catalyst for the rest of the film. Guards and prisoners are left fighting to the bitter end
