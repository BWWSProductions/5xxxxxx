       Doomsday is a 2008 British science fiction action film written and directed by Neil Marshall. The film takes place in the future, where Scotland has been quarantined due to the onset of a deadly virus. When the virus breaks out in London, political leaders send Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) to Scotland to find a cure based on evidence of survivors. Sinclair and her team run into two groups of survivors: marauders and medieval warriors. Doomsday was conceived by Marshall based on his vision of a futuristic soldier facing a medieval knight. In producing the film, he drew from various cinema, including Mad Max, Escape from New York, and other similar post-apocalyptic films.
