All of the actors in this episode are unknowns
except for young, sexy Dyan Cannon at the 
beginning of her long career!

Her name is misspelled in the end credits
though as \"Diane\".

She doesn\'t have much to do in the story,
although it\'s nice to see Bat with TWO women
at the end instead of one!
