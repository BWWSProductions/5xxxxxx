PLEASE SEED!"
,Matt90977,2010-08-20T03:35Z,Some parts are missing.  It seems to be missing parts with the bully in them.  part of the first fight is missing. part at the school where the kids spill Dre's Backpack all over the ground is missing. and some other little parts I believe.  Perhaps they showed a different version of the movie in whatever country this dvd is from (china maybe?) compared to the American version. It looks like this copy was edited to downplay the bullying from the chinese kid.
,Matt90977,2010-08-20T03:47Z,"@skeelz This movie is much better than the originals.  Besides, karate is crap. kung fu is so much cooler.  and the little smith kid seems like a fine actor to me.  For a young kid, he does a great job, and he has great facial expresions just like his dad. most important, the fight scenes are much better in this than in the old ones."
,Matt90977,2010-08-20T04:03Z,It seems that the part where Dre and the girl kiss behind the puppet she was cut too.

,killen76,2010-08-22T15:41Z,swesub for this one? anyone who knows whats the best place to look for swesubs? thanks for every movie....
,Bhudda1,2010-08-24T06:08Z,"This movie is actually called Kung Fu Baby!  Dre  Far too young for this role, fighting, revenge, romance bad example for young and should have been college level age group. Some aspects were sufficiently different some were not. "
,Subtracting,2010-08-26T06:51Z,"A/10
V/10
Great, besides the fact that there's a lot of missing scenes and no subtitles for non English parts so i will not be seeding this."
,war59312,2010-08-31T02:51Z,"Proper is out people!

The.Karate.Kid.2010.PROPER.720p.BluRay.x264-METiS

And yes proper includes non English parts subs."
,wiiS360,2010-09-10T02:16Z,"SEGMENTS ARE MISSING!!!! CHINESE IS NOT SUBBED!!! parts of fights are missing, most scenes with the bully have cut parts, the chinese is not subbed. this is a rip from a Chinese showing. STILL WORTH IT FOR THE QUALITY THOUGH!"
,istooge,2010-09-17T13:49Z,"My monitor cannot display HD/Blu-Ray resolutions, but would it work if I download this onto my USB and watched it on my PS3?"
,ss1138,2010-10-04T17:47Z,"Mat90997 is obviously an idiot. Great facial expressions? First of all -- wrong! Second of all, stick to your day job of making fries part time because you suck as a reviewer of anything."
,Tovansky,2010-11-05T01:45Z,"this is the asian region or chinese distributed version of the film, so there are some parts of the movie that were cut/missing (for example when the evil teacher shouted to finish Dre). "
,Cali916,2010-12-19T17:09Z,Thanks works great downloaded at 1.5mb the whole time
