,phinot,2010-08-23T14:21Z,"available this soon??? OMG!!! I've been waiting the whole summer for this! ... 

The album is great, chaotic, like an explosion! 

Now we have to wait for the EP with the outtakes of Surfing The Void!"
,thespace101,2010-08-25T22:01Z,...I meant here on TPB... but hey! this tracks encoding sound noisier than the songs actually are... but it is still good!
,daddybags,2010-09-25T15:32Z,"This is actually their 2007 album, Thanks for wasting my time."
,ACPF73,2010-09-29T20:35Z,Is this really the 2007 album?
,Rhythms,2010-11-04T00:57Z,"Great quality and great album!
Thanks a bunch!!!"
,el_presidente_djc,2010-12-04T19:45Z,"@daddybags - wot are you TALKING about? This is the new album pure and simple. Their 2007 album? That was Myths of The New Future, and has nothing to do with this one. Oh apart from it being by the same BAND that is. Ignore his comment one and all."
