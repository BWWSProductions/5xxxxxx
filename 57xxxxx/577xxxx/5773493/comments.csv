,kuro-san,2010-08-19T11:20Z,Why do so many Torrents from TvTeam in recent times have trouble finishing? IÂ´m stuck at 99.8% along with 140 peers IÂ´m connected to.. and only 1 out of 50 seeds is connectable. 
,kevrain,2010-08-19T11:48Z,"Your speil should be ""To avoid disappointment, dont try downloading from TvTeam, as failure to complete is a certainty""
6 seeders my A! Try Zero, and not just this torrent, but all by this mob of late."
,kevrain,2010-08-19T13:01Z,"Poor effort when uploader doesnt bother to at least seed until others can get full download and seed for others. Dont try and download people, will get to 99.8%, then stop"
,billykesas,2010-08-19T14:03Z,I have 200 kB more to completelly download the file. I tried watching it but it only goes up to 16:48. This is complete crap. Even with 200kB missing it should be whole. This is definitely a fake/faulty upload!
,Karen_Walker,2010-08-19T14:53Z,I too am stuck at 99.8%...bizarre as I have never had a problem with TvTeam uploads before.
,Deznaj,2010-08-19T20:12Z,"TvTeam sucks, and should be taken from the VIP list. Not the first torrent of them that gives shit, and it won't be the last.

Until the a-hole uploader checks his torrent client, we're all stuck on 99,8% for more than 12 hours now..."
