 Emmy Award-winning actor and comedian Chris Rock is back 
 in the stand-up spotlight with his fourth HBO special,   
 filmed live at the DAR Constitution Hall in Washington,  
 D.C. As always, Rock offers some uniquely insightful --  
 and absolutely hilarious -- takes on dozens of social,   
 political and celebrity issues. From marriage and        
 abortion to Michael Jackson and George W. Bush, nothing  
 escapes Rock's scathing observations. For adults only!
