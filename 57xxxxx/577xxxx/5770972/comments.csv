,tyrone7z,2010-09-06T10:07Z,"I can't believe I couldn't wait the last 22 hours.  Had to DL it.  I blame the Vin Mariani.  I pre-ordered the vinyl.  Thank you for making a fourth album.  I wasn't too sure that was going to happen--

,Julien Xavier,2010-09-10T20:28Z,Thanks. Superb. Always Malaise (The Man I Am) is Interpol at their darkest and most mysterious. Love it!
,paperjunk,2010-09-27T08:34Z,"Review of Interpol (#4)

""...""Barricade"" is ironically prophetic, segregating the promising first half of the album with its distended second...Our Love to Admire mayâve split fans of Bright Lights and Antics but Iâd rather listen to it a hundred times over than the second half of #4 again.""

IS JUST ANOTHER MP3 SHIT. "
,shinjukublack,2010-11-20T02:33Z,"@bigman1968:

I believe what you meant to say was: ""Thanks for the effort and the upload. I'll wait for the a FLAC rip, but thanks anyway!""

Instead of what you said. Which just makes you look like an elitist snot."
,shinjukublack,2010-11-20T02:34Z,"I'm only getting this for Barricade because the FLAC version I got on Demonoid is glitched.

I love how MOST of the FLAC rips I download are perfect except of one glaring glitch. It's not really an Exact Audio Copy or Lossless is it??

Anyway, thank you, Andythecurefan, I really appreciate the effort!"
,UncleSolo,2011-02-28T12:44Z,"Thanks Andy. Great upload. Especial thanks for including the album artwork too, so many neglect that."
