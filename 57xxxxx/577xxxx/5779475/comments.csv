Nothin' in it to censor."
,Tovansky,2010-11-05T01:56Z,maybe he is talking about the 8 minutes cut from the asian version. this might be the uncut one. i would try downloading this and would comment later. 
,Tovansky,2010-11-06T02:05Z,"so yea, this is the uncut version, with the srt file included for the chinese part of the film. It's not hardcoded, so you need to hardcode it yourself if u want to watch it on a ps3. I haven't tried whether this one is cinavia protected or not. "
