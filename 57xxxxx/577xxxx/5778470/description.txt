Simon And Garfunkel - The Definitive 1991 [EAC - FLAC] (oan)

Simon and Garfunkel are undoubtedly one of the most successful songwriting
duos of the 60s, reaching a similar level of popularity to the Beatles during the
latter part of the decade. This Definite Collection shows what a diverse duo
they really were and how many memorable tunes they performed together.
Though many were put off by the pair's more sterile folk-rock arrangements
and clean choirboy harmonies, this collection shows that there was much more
to their artistic palette. Songs such as "Homeward Bound", "I Am a Rock",
"Cecilia" and "Mrs Robinson" all show that the duo could rock with the best of
them and "The Sound of Silence" and "Bridge over Troubled Water" are just
some of the beautifully timeless records the pair gave us. It may not be as
definitive as it claims but this is a great collection featuring some of their best
and most well known works. --Paul Sullivan
