/// DESCRIPTION & FOREWARNING ///

This ISO is a rip of the "Definitive Map Collection" disc that came with the Marathon Trilogy CD set.

The rip is of the original CD, let me reiterate this, it is not simply a collection of maps. This is a RIP of an original CD.

It contains maps that had won Bungie's various map making contests, I've personally played a few and they all are quite fun.

Since Marathon is now completely free to play, I feel it's fine to upload the best community made maps that have been long missed from the game.

/// COMPATIBILITY & WHERE TO FIND PLAYERS ///

If you're playing on a PowerPC Macintosh without classic installed, you'll need the Aleph One player.

If you're running on an Intel Macintosh, PowerPC Macintosh, or Windows PC you will need the Aleph One player.

You can find the Aleph One players here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/marathon/

Simply place the Aleph One player in the same folder as the game and play using the Aleph One player.

/// LOADING THE MAPS OFF THE CD ///

On a PC you can use software such as Alcohol 120% to mount the ISO and download the maps, or you can burn it to a CD if you wish.

On a Macintosh you can use Disk Utility or simply double-click the ISO to mount it and download the maps, or you can burn it to a CD with Disk Utility.
