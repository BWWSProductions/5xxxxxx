If the ISO image doesn't work, I'll make it into a RAR instead."

,caseyw,2010-10-05T16:30Z,If you guys seed the last 1/3 that I am missing I will forever seed at ~100 kb/s.
,caseyw,2010-10-07T23:00Z,I now have all the parts and am seeding this at a constant rate of 100 kb/s. There might be a couple hours that I may be out due to switching computers.
