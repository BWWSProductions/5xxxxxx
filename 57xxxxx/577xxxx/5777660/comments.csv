,DeltaPan,2010-08-20T15:34Z,"Did a simple TPB search and found it is already upped  almost a month ago mate...

http://thepiratebay.org/search/VH1%20Hip-Hop%20Honors%20/0/99/0

It's what the search bar, top left, is for, simplicity itself, you could have done the exact same thing, i'm sure.

Same as searching the DHT in a BT client, like Azureus allows, would have pulled them results up, maybe upped elsewhere with more seeds in some cases.

Search and if not finding what you want, then ask, also TPB has a forum for requests and reseeds.
http://suprbay.org/

Helps if you ask there instead of posting on torrent for requests or reseeds, i know 20/40 and a couple of others have responded on their torrent pages as to what they intend encoding and to requests but more often than not requests on torrent pages get ignored, TV Team are not 20/40 and i have never seen them post comment never mind respond to a downloader.

Peace. : )"

Go to Suprbay, TPB forum and ask there.

Peace. : )"

All fixed now.

Enjoy."
