iMBT NOTES
The dvdrip from Miyagi has no English subtitles for the Chinese speaking  scenes, moreover, it is actually not from R3 DVD, instead, it is "castrated", as Chinese people say, by the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television of China, which results in the fact that a total length of 8 minutes scenes were cut out to accomodate laws and regulations in China.
Hereby we proudly present a full length theatrical cut release and hope you will enjoy.

credit iMBT & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
