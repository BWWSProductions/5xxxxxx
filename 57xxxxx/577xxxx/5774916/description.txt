YES!!!!  -- PIRATE BAY FIXED THE EDIT FUNCTION!!!

This is the second disc to the 2-disc special edition.

Screen shot of original:
Same frame screen shot from transcoded:
Each menu entry has been encoded to a separate file, and organized in folders for each sub menu.
I included a copy of MP4Box, and instructions on how to use it to concatenate the files.
Also there are batch scripts to automate the concatenation.
To get the join_scripts to work correctly, you need to right-click the .RAR and 'Extract Here' (not to some other folder).

NOTE:  All files were converted the same way, except "04._theatrical_campaign 2._comic-con_new_york_sneak_peek.mp4".
This was first converted to uncompressed RBG, run through Handbrake, then I used
MP4Box to (losslessly) set the correct Display Aspect Ratio (MP4Box.exe -par 1=32:27 ).
The reason is because if I went "DVD file &gt; Handbrake" then that file would
not concatenate properly (joined video became extremely garbled when it got to that part).
So keep an eye on that file if you decide to manipulate any of them.
