Synopsis
Rusko has made a name for himself in the dubstep world by introducing a focus on mid-range wobble over sub-bass tremor. O.M.G. is only his first full-length, despite his presence on the scene for several years. For the album Rusko has broadened his sound to include other electro styles like disco, house, and garage. He has also included a puzzling array of guests, including Amber Coffman of the Dirty Projectors, Italian dance duo Crookers, and Atlanta rapper Gucci Mane.
