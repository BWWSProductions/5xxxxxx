It's Friday, ya bastids!

Some of the strippers at the clubs near Ground Zero have spoken out. Give them creditâ€¦ itâ€™s not easy to take a stand when youâ€™re wearing 8-inch heels. They should survey all of the strippers in lower Manhattan. If thereâ€™s anyone who is familiar with the concept of â€œpolls,â€ itâ€™s strippers.

Hereâ€™s some news for opponents of the centerâ€”Muslim prayer services have been held since 2009 at the proposed community center site. The new part of the proposal is an Islamic community center with a swimming pool and gym. So are opponents really just opposed to Muslims getting into shape? OK Muslims, you can pray, but donâ€™t do any crunches! Maybe opposition to the gym and the pool would be a clever move. There is a right to freedom of religion in the Constitution, but no specific right to work out. Yes, the Declaration of Independence does mention a right to â€œthe pursuit of happiness,â€ but in my experience working out has nothing to do with happiness.

Why are 20-somethings taking so long to grow up? People in their 20â€™s are still searching for themselves. I can tell you where you can find yourselfâ€”in the bathroom. At least thatâ€™s where you are every time I need to use it. Anyway, for people who canâ€™t commit, kids in their 20â€™s seem to have no problem committing to having some tramp-stamp tattooed on their upper butts for the rest of their lives. Iâ€™m glad I didnâ€™t commit to a tattoo in my early 20â€™s. I would have spent the past couple of decades explaining to people who the hell Night Ranger is.

On that note, a new study says that the â€œcougarâ€ phenomenon of older women hooking up with younger guys doesnâ€™t really exist. As soon as they heard that, a bunch of young guys thought â€œGreat. I just learned to dance â€˜the Hustleâ€™ for nothing.â€ A researcher named Michael Dunn says he searched and was unable to find any evidence of cougars. My first question would be â€œhow old is Michael Dunn?â€ If heâ€™s is over 40, heâ€™s wasting his time looking for cougars. Weâ€™re not coming out for him. If you want to find us, Michael Dunn, donâ€™t go looking yourself. Send out Zac Efron.
