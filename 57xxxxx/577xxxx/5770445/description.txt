Blonde Redhead return this fall with the release of Penny Sparkle, the sublime new album from the feted New York trio.
Released on September 14th (13th outside the US), Penny Sparkle â€“ the bandâ€™s third for 4AD - marks another sonic twist in their already adventurous canon. It was made over the last year with the band journeying between New York and Stockholm to work with production duo Van Rivers and The Subliminal Kid (Fever Ray, Glasser) and as with their previous album, 23, Alan Moulder (Depeche Mode, My Bloody Valentine, Yeah Yeah Yeahs) was enlisted to mix it. Blonde Redhead have already announced some forthcoming live shows in Ottawa and Seattle next month and can today reveal that their next return to Europe will be around the albumâ€™s release this September. Taking in nine countries (with more to add), their tour finishes on the 29th of September at the Shepherdâ€™s Bush Empire in London.
