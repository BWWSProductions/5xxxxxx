Being a great admirer of Miles Davis and Chet Baker, his career started at an early age, when he played in clubs in Turin. 

He has played on tours and concerts in USA, Japan, Canada, Europe, Brazil, China, Argentina, taking part in important Festivals (Montreal, Toronto, Houston, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Perugia, Antibes, Berlin, Paris Tokyo, Peking, etc). He has several times been elected best musician in the annual referendum conducted by â€œMusica Jazzâ€, and has also won the title in the â€œbest groupâ€ and â€œbest italian albumâ€ categories. In the past years he has toured and recorded with his â€œElectric Fiveâ€.

At present, he plays in several concerts with his new quintet composed of young talents as Gianluca Petrella and Stefano Bollani and affirmed musicians as Rosario Bonaccorso and Roberto Gatto. He has founded in 1999 a quintet with trumpet player Paolo Fresu and recorded â€œShades Of Chetâ€ for Label Bleu. He also leads a duo with young and gifted piano player Stefano Bollani.
