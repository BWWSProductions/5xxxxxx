Live at the Ryman is the fourth live album from Texas songwriter Robert Earl 
Keen, and while there isn't much arguing that the man is a terrific performer 
who knows how to work a crowd, the puzzler is, does the world really need 
another document of Keen on-stage? It's not an unfair question, but at very 
least Live at the Ryman captures him on a better than average night. There 
are no real surprises in the set list on Live at the Ryman, which seems to be 
the way his audience wants it -- the crowd on this disc is loud and wildly 
enthusiastic, frequently singing along with Keen and chanting his name 
between songs as if he were some sort of conquering hero, and Keen and his 
band serve up the "hits" just the way the fans want 'em. Thankfully, Keen 
seems pretty jazzed by the crowd's enthusiasm (no wonder, since he was 
getting such a warm welcome at Nashville's former home of the Grand Ol' 
Opry), and he and his band deliver these 14 songs with a large portion of 
energy. Keen's road band is in solid form here (with the great Danny Barnes 
sitting in on banjo), and though Keen has sung these songs with more soul, 
he's never short on fire and brings a showman's passion to the presentation. 
If the song selection is a bit predictable, why wouldn't you want to hear Keen 
sing "Gringo Honeymoon," "I'm Comin' Home," "Corpus Christi Bay," or even 
"Merry Christmas from the Family" on-stage? Live at the Ryman was 
obviously recorded for Robert Earl Keen's loyal fans, and they won't feel 
shortchanged by this disc, even if it covers ground he's covered several times 
before.

This live set at country music's historic epicenter captures singer-songwriter 
Robert Earl Keen at his most compelling, performing his rip-roaring yet often 
sentimental songs to an audience of adoring fans. Featuring favorites like the 
regretful "What I Really Mean," the wild-and-wooly "Gringo Honeymoon," and 
the uproarious finale "Farm Fresh Onions," Keen displays the good-humored 
vitality and innate musicianship that have made him one of country music's 
most enduring below-the-radar talents

"Everything is played with lively precision by guitarist Rich Brotherton, bassist 
Bill Whitbeck, drummer Tom Van Schaik and steel guitarist Marty Muse, with 
Danny Barnes guesting on banjo. It's hard to imagine a better show..."
