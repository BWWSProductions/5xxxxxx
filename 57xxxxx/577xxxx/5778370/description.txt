I know most of you are probably saying that Quo Vadis is from Canada. I thought the same thing until recently when I purchased this album and got home and realized this wasn't the band I was expecting. None the less, this band blew me away and I just had to share it with the torrent community. So please enjoy this up brought to you by RG, Those of The Unlight, and Please remember to seed afterward for everyone to have.
