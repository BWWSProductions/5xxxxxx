The Well-Tempered Synthesizer is a 1969 album released by Wendy Carlos (then released as Walter Carlos) following the groundbreaking Switched-On Bach in the previous year. The album consists of a selection of pieces by Monteverdi, Domenico Scarlatti, and Handel as well as Bach whose music was exclusively featured on the first album. The title of The Well-Tempered Synthesizer is a play on Bach\'s own collection of pieces entitled The Well-Tempered Clavier.

All selections were performed on a Moog modular synthesizer system. Like Switched On Bach, The Well-Tempered Synthesizer was recorded on an 8 track Ampex tape recorder using numerous takes and overdubs. This was long before the days of MIDI sequencers and recording the album was by all accounts a laborious process.

About Carlos\'s rendition of Brandenburg Concerto No. 4, renowned Canadian concert pianist Glenn Gould had the following to say: Carlos\'s realization of the Fourth Brandenburg Concerto is, to put it bluntly, the finest performance of any of the Brandenburgs â€” live, canned, or intuited â€” I\'ve ever heard.

I have ripped this from CD using winamp at a relatively high bitrate. As far as I am aware the quality is near as dammit faultless although it\'s been along time since i last had time to listen to the whole thinag all the way through.

I first heard this 33 years ago on an LP. The quality of the original recording was amazing then. It has lost nothing in translation from Vinyl to CD.

Enjoy!
