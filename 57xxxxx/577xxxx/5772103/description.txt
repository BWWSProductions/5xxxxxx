DeYarmond Edison is perhaps best known as the former band of the members of Bon Iver and Megafaun. Guitarist and vocalist Justin Vernon created Bon Iver; the remaining members (Brad Cook: bass, guitar; Phil Cook: keyboards, banjo; Joe Westerlund: Percussion) went on to form the freak folk group Megafaun.
