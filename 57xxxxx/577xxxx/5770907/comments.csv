[T],rchp,2010-08-18T08:15Z,Thanks!!
,OscarTheSlouch,2010-08-19T14:45Z,"Hey, 2nafish! Thanks for sharing all these wonderful music videos with everyone! 

I am running several of them now that are maddeningly stuck, some at 99%+, I was wondering if you knew of a decent way to request re-seeds of some of them?

I'm sure a big part of the problem is inconsiderate hit-and-runners.

Thanks!
"
[V],2nafish,2010-08-19T15:20Z,I can re-seed the videos for you. Just let me know which ones you want. Write them below this comment and I'll let you know when I can re-seed them.
,OscarTheSlouch,2010-08-20T05:16Z,"Hey, 2nafish--thanks for the offer of help! Below is the list, 
although I'm pretty sure one or more of the ones at the end are not 
yours.

Nevertheless, I'd really appreciate any help you can give, 
ESPECIALLY with the ones in the first group, which are personal 
(mine or my wife's) favorites.

There is no rush on it; we'll appreciate any help you can give us 
whenever you get around to it.

BY THE WAY: Many of the older torrent files were marked with 
""private = 1"" bencoded into them. Since this renders DHT and PEX 
unusable (and PirateBay's tracker has been offline for quite a while 
now--and will not be back), I decided to re-work the torrent files to 
remove the Private flag and add a tracker (usually OpenBitTorrent.com 
or PublicBT.com).

I don't know whether or not the existing .torrent files can easily be 
replaced on TPB (the hashcodes are identical) but, if so, these 
edited .torrent files might save someone some time and trouble in 
the future.

Lemme know whether or not you want them. 

Also, THANKS AGAIN for the re-seeding help. You have a fabulous 
music/video/file collection!

[V],2nafish,2010-08-25T12:45Z,"You are correct, I don't have the videos at the bottom of the list. I'm re-seeding the really important ones now and the ""everything else"" list to Jim Croce and above except for Aerosmith-Girls Of Summer. I'll finish the rest of the ""everything else"" list as soon as the first ones have enough seeds. I'll leave another message when I start re-seeding the rest of the videos."
