,Decker74,2010-08-28T01:19Z,"Excellent!
Thanks for this!"
,mizmahara,2010-08-31T18:10Z,Is the breakdowns not available for the workouts?
,joewobbles,2011-02-07T00:46Z,thanks
,grinnellja,2011-03-09T05:13Z,this doesn't include the New To Class DVD.....so where am I supposed to get that? I can't jump into the workout without knowing the moves first! :/
,grinnellja,2011-03-09T05:20Z,"derp. nevermind. got my information from a stupid source, it's not called New To Class, it's called Get Fired Up.....and it's included in this torrent. Thanks a lot! This workout is super intense"
,grinnellja,2011-03-09T05:38Z,"Nevermind, the New to Class is an option that is supposed to be included with every DVD, apparently it's not included in this set. Which makes it really hard to try and keep up with the fast pace of the classes. So where do I get the whole version of turbofire?"
,deathtrooper30,2011-05-10T14:06Z,Fucking buy it dumb ass! Do what you can and stop worrying about being perfect!
