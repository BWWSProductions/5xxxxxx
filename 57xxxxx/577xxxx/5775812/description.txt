LEGEND OF ZELDA: THE TWILIGHT PRINCESS
[Gamecube Version] [USA Version]

*****
If you like the game, I recommend purchasing this game for Gamecube or Wii, as it is much better with a non-pirated copy. I do own this game for the wii, and it is much easier to play it on a console.

The reason why this is the GC version, is because it is much easier to play in Dolphin than the wii equivilent, especially when using a gaming controller.
