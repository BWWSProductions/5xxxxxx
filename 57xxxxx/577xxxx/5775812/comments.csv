if u have any questions feel free."
,rrabbit28,2010-11-02T05:31Z,alright cheers for the up. havin trouble getting it to work. do i need to burn it to a cd?
,_4_,2010-11-04T08:47Z,"No you should not have to.

A few things you will probably need is:
Open GL 2.0 support from your graphics card. 
Possibly an interpreter processing in the emulator options. 
A pretty decent processor for good playback.

If you want to play via dvd, you may want to download the Wii version to play on a modded wii.

Hope that helped."
,slim912,2010-11-19T07:18Z,"works fine, jus configure the settings"
,Kallim,2010-12-10T12:31Z,"I'm having some major graphical issues. the top left corner of my screen is just a box of random colors, water is nowhere to be seen. I get no game sound. And half the time the game doesnt even start properly. It starts up, goes through the developer logos and then it just freezes with a black screen =S any idea what this might be caused by?"
,_4_,2010-12-13T06:48Z,"You may need to tweak your settings in the emulator. You may need to change the kind of processing, or the engine used to process the game. Maybe a different plugin will solve the problem.

If that is not the problem, then I would make sure other games with high quality ratings work as well, or else there may be an issue with graphics card support."
,_4_,2010-12-13T06:50Z,"There is also a 'bloom hack' or something of the sort, i forget. It may solve the issue with the graphics, but the sound im not sure.

Some games take a bit of painful tweaking with the settings to get them to work right."
,CuiYouEnVy,2010-12-29T03:10Z,Im having Game problems everytime i go wolf mode and i try to howl near the plants the game freezes. This shows up...error trying to compile at 0 LR=80253b14
,Retro_Johnny,2011-01-14T17:49Z,"o_O how do I extract these? 

Do I highlight all the RAR files and extract all together?"
,NeMoD6989,2011-01-22T21:15Z,"@Retro_Johnny

Just extract the first archive, and it should extract the rest of them into a .iso file"
,critters30,2011-05-03T21:19Z,"Game works perfectly with Dolphin r7501. Thanks for the upload, great game!"
,XSilentHills,2011-06-11T22:24Z,"Can someone tell me what they did in configuration to make this work? I have Dolphin r7584 and when I set the engine to Open GL I get a notice saying Dolphin has encountered a problem and needs to close. 

What am I doing wrong?

Please help me, I REALLY want to play this game!"
,_4_,2011-07-23T06:59Z,"@XSilentHills Your graphics card needs to support open GL 2.0 im pretty sure. Otherwise maybe another option may also work, but sometimes with certain video cards all you can do is try different options to get the emulator to work the best.

You can also try searching for that problem on google, if that has anything that can help."
,bhutan_6,2011-08-03T20:29Z,Great torrents. Thanks. I have a request to everyone. Can you upload 2 rare Gamecube games (NTSC-U) Star wars rouge squadron 2: rouge leader and Prince of persia: sands of time in Piratebay. Thx in advance. Both of the games are in IGN's all time 25 best GC games list.

for people using Dolphin (DOLPHIN ONLY)

for anybody Missing VCOMP100.DLL
""you need to install Visual Studio 2010""

Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable SP1 (x86) (x86 is 32bit)

if your missing  xinput1_3.dll
download DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer

http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=35

if your still getting an Error then UPDATE your graphic's driver.
before updating your graphics driver make a Restore Point.


for memory card problems 
Step 1: Run Dolphin in ""Run as Administrator""
Step 2: after opening Dolphin go to the tab ""Emulation"" and UNCHECK Read-only mode
Step 3: then run your ROM or .iso 
if it says FORMAT memory card then DO IT. if it fails. restart computer and redo steps"
