Date decisions amongst a few songs
that had multiple circulating video sources
from shows prior to 1/1/01 were made to
try and include as many different show dates
as possible. Sources were very limited thus
this is in no way a best perfomance disc.
It's only intended to be an example of how these
songs looked around the time of the release of BTCS.

Avoided Using Pro-Shot Sources
Except When Necessary (Spoon)

There's a 5 to 10 sec video drop towards the end of Crush. This was on the master source.  Also one spot of diginoise (audio) for 2 seconds at the beginning of The Last Stop.
