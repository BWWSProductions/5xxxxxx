[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-18T01:56Z,"@ Everyone - Would anyone like me to upload a Lil Wayne music video pack, cuz I plan on encoding about 6-10 of his music videos for a friend and myself for G1, PSP, iPod, iPod Touch, iPhone, Zune.

I will re-encode The IT Crowd S01 and S02 in a 1-2 weeks with my new settings. Also I will do S04 of The IT Crowd later this week.

I will also re-encode some of my older stuff other the next couple of weeks. 

I just finished encoding Sons of Anarchy S01 and have tested it, I will upload it to the seedbox tonight. I have S.O.A. season 2 and plan on encoding it in the next 2-4 days, so evewryone can be ready for S03 which starts next month. 

I just tested Seinfeld S01 and it works, so I will upload it tonight to the seedbox.

I am about to encode Burn Notice S01 or Eureka S01. 

Right now I am uploading Castle S01 to the seedbox, cuz I encoded it last night."
