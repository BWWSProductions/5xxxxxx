Another set of hopeful entrepreneurs pitch to the multi-millionaire investors. Northern Irish mum Jacqueline McKay thinks she has the stress-busting accessory for travelling parents everywhere - a suitcase that turns into a cot. Businessman Stephen Maher has a shattering pitch that he hopes will grab the Dragons' attention and an investment in his emergency escape invention. Plus, Ralf Klinnert thinks his musical cones have money making potential, and the world's smallest car is in the Den.
