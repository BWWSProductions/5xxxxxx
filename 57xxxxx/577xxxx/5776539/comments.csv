,Reqrezentin,2010-08-20T08:12Z,"THIS ONE DOESN'T WORK!

I think he messed around with it when trying to make it NO RAR.

This one works, try it out http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5776543/Jersey.Shore.S02E04.WS.PDTV.XviD-aAF"
,PhilLesh12,2010-08-20T08:41Z,"This is becoming way too common with TvTeam torrents.

For whatever reason, they have been playing games with torrents.  Throttling them, or allowing peers to download 99.9% but then somehow withholding the last couple hundred kilobytes so everyone is stuck with a partial file.

TvTeam is defective and deceptive.

FUCK THEM!"
,PhilLesh12,2010-08-20T08:44Z,"@Reqrezentin,

That link just goes to TvTeam's other account that posts rar file torrents.

If you look closely, scenebalance always posts at the same time as TvTeam, the only difference is that they post the original scene torrent with rars, and TvTeam posts the no-rar version.

I haven't tested this, but I have a feeling the same games are being played with scenebalance torrents that are being played with TvTeam torrents.  

They are one and the same."

,ScottdMac,2010-08-20T17:59Z,"This the second torrent stuck at 99.9&  (mayby more from tvteam...)
Anyway - I loaded the file up in VLC player and it repairs it.   Watchable."
