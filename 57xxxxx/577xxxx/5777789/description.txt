A strong live set recorded at the Unity Temple near Chicago, this performance
was released on the adventurous Swedish label Ayler Records as a precursor to
saxophonist Noah Howard's first tour of Sweden. Working with pianist Bobby Few,
bassist Wilber Morris, and drummer Calyer Duncan, Howard leads his tight and
exciting quartet through five original compositions, some, such as "The
Blessing" and "Schizophrenic Blues," are very much identified with the
saxophonist. Howard's playing is crisp, melodic, and clear, a tad less intense
than decades past, but nonetheless compelling. His alto retains the mournful
wail of Ornette, but with a distinct identity. In an interesting twist, Howard
blows on tenor sax on "Lightning Rod, Pt. 1" with the same power and
forcefulness, but with a naturally deeper and more gutsy tone. Somehow, he seems
less restrained on tenor, perhaps not as concerned with tone and more with pure
energy. Bobby Few and Wilber Morris are two of the best accompanists in the
business, and neither disappoints, although the bassist is a bit weak in the
mix. Few, in particular, takes numerous solos, his vision and individual style
etched in the sand. Duncan, too, is a lesser known, but equally worthy sidekick,
spurring Howard forward like a race driver in the midst of heated
competition. Howard has made a few recordings through the years, and most are
worth hearing. This may not be his best, but it nonetheless clearly reflects his
stature as a giant in the genre of free improvisation.
