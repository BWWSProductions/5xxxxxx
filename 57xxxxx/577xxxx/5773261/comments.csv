,T0MF0073RY,2010-08-19T12:42Z,"Hmmm... I keep getting the message ""No input file specified"" when clicking on the download link. And no, I don't mean the giant green [DOWNLOAD] button, but the actual one to download the torrent. Any help on this?"
,astroblak,2010-08-19T17:25Z,please check this file.. getting the same error
,Elwood42087,2010-08-19T18:03Z,"I am also getting the screen with just ""No input file selected"" text when clicking the download link. If you could re-upload the torrent that would be great, I haven't seen it anywhere else all week.

Thanks in advance"
,plizken,2010-08-19T22:02Z,Use the magnet link.  
,Yondering,2010-08-19T23:43Z,"I too, am receiving that error message.  Likewise, the Magnet Link isn't working either.

I don't believe it is a problem with this specific Torrent, as some other Torrent links are also resulting in the same error message.

Thank you for uploading this show.  I hope you are able to re-submit this torrent, or ThePirateBay fixes their internal errors."
,T0MF0073RY,2010-08-20T01:08Z,Thanks plizkin. I'm actually surprised that I haven't thought of that myself.
,johnny_carnage,2010-08-20T03:59Z,USE MAGNET LINK.  Confirmed working. 
,Elwood42087,2010-08-20T23:56Z,"Yup, used the magnet link and it worked, just had to hit the setting in uTorrent to associate it with magnet URIs"
