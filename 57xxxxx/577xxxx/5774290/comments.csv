You must have him confused with Klaus Dinger, who founded Neu! and was Kraftwerks drummer for a time in the early days. Get your facts straight.  "

This is NOT a complete discography..."
,ImrtlSaij,2011-08-16T21:07Z,"hey it's totally awesome to just see everyone bashing a torrent. the das boot error is humorous, but really? ""it's not complete!"" it says right in the title 15 albums, so even if the poster doesn't know of other albums, you still know what's going on here. the other torrent for Kraftwerk is missing tags. completely. it would be nice to see in the description or your comments some information, like what albums are included, bitrate, if it's tagged properly, artwork, etc. instead of just reading comments of whining."
