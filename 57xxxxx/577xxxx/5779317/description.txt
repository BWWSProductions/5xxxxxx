This pack includes some useful software for the Nokia n70 and any other compatible phone.
The pack includes:
Flashlight 1.1.0 - FULL version
Allows you to use your N70's flash as a lintern(constantly powered on, ot just for a moment)

Blacklist PRO
This version didn't work for me but I included it in the package because there might be people who know khow to make it work by modyfing it a bit.
It's a program that allows you to filter the calls you receive, so that you only receive calls frm numbers you want to.
It works somewhat like the Adblock Plus in Firefox.

Bluetooth Remote Control
Control your PC using your phone, via Bluetooth

Alarm Manager
You can set alarms for each day of the week without having to activate them and they will just start at the time you set them to.

Anamwhite
Simple white skin for N70

Best Desk - main screen replacement for N70
CallFilter(same function as Blacklist PRO)
Call Recorder->record your calls
Camera FX -> allows you to modify , transform the aspect of an object before you take a photo of it.(not FULL version, will post a comment when I find it)
XviD Codec
DivX Player
EZScreenLock->allows you to set a timer after which the phone locks(like a self-locking keyboard configuration but this also gives you the option of setting a photo as a background while the phone's locked and of course, put a password protection so no one can access your phone without your knowledge)
FaceWarp->allows you to modify the aspect of someone's face in a a funny way
FontViewer->allows viewing the phone's currently installed fonts
HairStyle->allows you to change someone's hairstyle by using one of the available styles,after taking a photo of that person.
