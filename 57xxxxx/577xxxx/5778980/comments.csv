,noman4747,2011-03-06T04:05Z,how is this a 720p when the res is 1280 x 544? Am i missing something  here or  ? :/
,slicedt,2011-03-12T05:26Z,"@noman4747
The original was 720p, this is it's rip."
,view.askew79,2011-03-12T23:28Z,"@norman and sliced, it is the same as the original, this is 720p, it doesn't have to be 1280x720 to be 720p due to having the black bars on the original. Read up on it before commenting."

,BMPRIZ,2011-04-16T07:47Z,if the video is in 1080p then why is the quality only rated 7 and 7?
,hauntnut,2011-04-16T21:40Z,"@ BMPRIZ: The quality votes you're referring to is not a reflection of the video/audio quality on a number scale, but simply the number of votes given by users that this is a good torrent. If you like the torrent, you either vote on the ""+"" side, or you vote on the ""-"" side if you didn't like it. "
