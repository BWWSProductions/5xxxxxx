Notes
2 disc reissue of the 29 track original and Greatest Hits Collection. 

"Funeral Pyre" was remixed in August 1983 as nobody was completely happy with the original mix. It was decided to use the demo version of "That's Entertainment" on this collection. Although technically not as good as the later version recorded for Sound Affects, the demo has a certain quality that was never captured again.
