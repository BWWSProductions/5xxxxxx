...................................NFO:.................................................History.Channel.Gates.of.Hell.HDTV.XviD-MOMENTUM

Legendary volcanoes, geysers and faultlines found in Iceland, Mexico, Greece, Italy and Japan 
appear to descend into another reality -- an underworld deep within the earth. In some cases, 
they have been seen as 'hellmouths'. We will investigate each of these places and reveal the 
geological reasons they evoked such fear and awe.We will also launch a larger exploration into 
the history of the concept of the underworld: civilizations have often conceived of a physical 
world within the earth that operates with its own structure and rules. From Dante's Inferno to 
the Mayan Gates of Hell, each legend speaks of a portal divided into a series of steps. We 
will decode the symbolism of each passage, identify the unique elements from each civilization, 
and reveal the universal truths to the timeless concept of the underworld.
