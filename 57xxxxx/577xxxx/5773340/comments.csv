Enjoy!"
,Fruster,2010-08-19T20:48Z,"Now this is a favourite!
First of all, it's got Luciana Paluzzi! And that's real quality (think James Bond Thunderball).
The rest of the quality is genuine schlock! The effects are spectacularly unspectacular, and the acting is, shall we say, not spectacular. And the monsters! Daleks whithout protruding bits, but with tentacles and some strange greenish skin.
I Like It!"
