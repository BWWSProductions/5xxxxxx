           In your typical family, the father is not a magnetic,          
           amoral and womanizing genius; the deceased mother is not       
           immortalized by a 12-metre metallic replica; the youngest      
           son does not have electricity literally crackling through      
           his veins; and the older son â€¼ together with his         
           robotic wiener dog, Pickle - does not pledge to overthrow      
           the entire family order. The Edison family, however, is        
           far from typical. And Edison & Leo is far from your            
           typical stop-motion animated feature film.
