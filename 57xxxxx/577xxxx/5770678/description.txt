Celestial Dragon Records is now out with their latest compilation titled Vital Signs and is the project of Tyler Smith of Androcell and Distant System fame. It's definitely his personal pet project as half of the tracks are his: three Androcell tracks and a Distant System. He's also gathered four of the biggest names in the genre to round out the album.
