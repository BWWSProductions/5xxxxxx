Throwback Game
Dec. 16, 1979
Fittingly, Roger Staubach had one more comeback win left in him as he guided the Cowboys to a thrilling win over the Redskins in his final regular season game.

The schedule makers could not be more pleased with how the Ã¢ï¿½â€šï¿½ï¿½â€žï¿½79 season turned out. Dallas and Washington met in their season finale in Irving, Texas with the division title on the line. The game proved to be one of most thrilling games in this long rivalry.

Roger Staubach, playing in his final regular season game of his Hall of Famer career, capped the dramatic comeback finish by finding wide receiver Tony Hill on an 8-yard touchdown pass with 39 second left in the game. It not only gave the Cowboys a 35-34 win but also the NFC Eastern Division title. Furthermore, the loss knocked the Redskins out of the playoffs.

Washington seemed well on their way to capturing the division crown after jumping out to an early 17-0 lead. Dallas fought their way back but Washington put 17 points on the scoreboard in the fourth quarter to again take control of the game. The team was all but ready to celebrate victory after running back John Riggins raced 66 yards for a touchdown to give the Redskins a comfortable 34-21 lead with just under seven minutes to play in the game.

But that all changed as Roger Ã¢ï¿½â€šï¿½ï¿½â€œThe DodgerÃ¢ï¿½â€šï¿½ï¿½Â capitalized on a turnover by Washington and drove the Dallas offense 59 yards for a touchdown. After the defense held the Redskins, Staubach guided the Cowboys 75 yards in seven plays capped by his game-winning throw.

Staubach finished with 336 yards passing and 3 TDs while the Cowboys had a pair of 100-yard receivers in Hill (8-113) and Preston Pearson (5-108). Washington was led by RigginsÃ¢ï¿½â€šï¿½ï¿½â€žï¿½ 151 yards rushing.
