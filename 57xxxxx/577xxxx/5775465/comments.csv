To all the seeders: thanks a lot, guys, keep up the good job!"
,keleieke,2011-01-07T05:21Z,"Metal1Dead, do you remember posting to a TPB member concerning a certain private torrent site...  I tried it again and got in; no invite code needed; leave it blank.  If you see this message the moment I hit send, I'd say TRY IT NOW!  Otherwise try it periodically and you might get lucky.  Note: I've been a member for an hour and already have an issue with ratio...  what if you pick an old, not so hot, torrent with no leachers; does that mean I'll have to keep seeding to no one until my ratio is 1:1; that may take years.  Doesn't seem like fresh torrents with lots of leachers should be the only rule abiding option.   "
