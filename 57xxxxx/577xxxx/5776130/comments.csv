,TPBSPY,2010-08-20T10:46Z,Bout bloody time... :(
,superscot81,2010-08-20T11:15Z,Where are the English subtitles? I downloaded the movie and played it. Great video and sound but no subtitles on the movie when I played it.

Well now I admit I'm technically clueless but once someone walks me through a process I can usually pick it up.
You on the other hand are simply intellectually bankrupt and a foul mouthed idiot and will be that for life.
With a mouth like that you must be a lonely insecure person."
,jew_green,2010-08-21T09:49Z,There's some serious teenaged rage going on in this comment section.
,dudew8,2010-08-21T14:38Z,"Thanks raymondhome , IP man is a awesome movie :D"
,transc3nd,2010-08-22T02:47Z,where is the love?....
,kenjamen,2010-08-22T05:16Z,"@MrGundIsMyBitch

HAHAHA I really enjoyed reading your comments.  You're right on about everything.  Maybe a little too wordy but still right on.  Cracks me up lol.  Imagine what a better world it would be if people would learn how to figure shit out themselves.  "
,bcapelli1,2010-08-22T06:23Z,all this shit talking about how to play the subs but no word on subtitle quality...are they understandable? when ip man 2 came out the subs confused me more than the cantonese audio. i was inconvenienced to have to invite a hot chinese girl to translate...sub quality anyone or do i have to get laid again?
,GSArora,2010-08-22T15:25Z,"@AvaMonKir
Although yeah, he was a little harsh, he's totally right. You have search engines literally at your fingertips, but you don't use it? If I need to look something up, I just move the mouse to a corner, click, and type what I need. He also did tell the guy how to use the subs, he just added his own opinion on top of it."
,GSArora,2010-08-23T06:58Z,"@MrGundIsMyBitch
You're comments are awesome. They give all the necessary information, and than some. It's the little touches that really get to me, like ""u liking touching kids"", and ""massive brain damage causing retardation."""
,GSArora,2010-08-23T10:46Z,"oh yeah, thx for the up raymondhome"
,Arvaez,2010-08-23T12:30Z,"MrGundIsMyBitch, Highfive.  I thought I was alone in this sea of idiots.  You said everything I would have said and even questioned these fools sexuality to the very end.  Good show.  And by sea of idiots I mean the world in general, not this thread or site or an actual body of water.  This torrent looks interesting and I originally clicked on it thinking it was Internet Protocol Man, some interwebs super hero.  It turns out that MrGundIsMyBitch is our true interwebs superhero.  I'll have to check this series out on IMDB and see what it's about rather than ask here like some douche bag.  I thank the uploader as you have exposed me to what seems like an interesting foreign film without having to brave any seedy rental shops in Little Asia.  High fives all around for the interwebs superheros of the pirate bay.  "
,roybott,2010-08-25T00:16Z,I wonder how MrGundIsMyBitch can be so angry. maybe bullied as a child or he simply is a child with adhd

,sbale,2010-10-24T07:54Z,"It appears raymondhome has upoaded this torrent in several formats. In the one which is 733 mb the uploader comment: ""QUALITY IS BETTER THAN PREVIOUS RELEASES"" which i presume are this one (973 mb) and another one (1.4 Gb). So i suggest to download and seed the 733 mb torrent"
,awitch,2010-10-25T08:52Z,Downloaded this movie several times from different sources hoping that i'll eventually have English subs.Still no luck! Can anyone help please.

,martian_neighbour,2010-10-30T16:11Z,Seriously can somebody post a link to an accurate  english sub? Seems like the subs I've downloaded so far are translated by european fuckheads.
,Bhak2k12,2011-01-12T07:09Z,how do you play the subtitles on the movie it self on a ps3 
,IMMG,2011-01-17T22:07Z,will it play for iTunes

,Onlythebest2011,2011-03-08T01:36Z,"Another awesome foreign film!!!  I was slightly confused too why they reused some actors from the first and second films as new characters....but I guess authentic Chinese martial artists/actors are few and far between.  All in all this was a awesome torrent. 
Thanks Raymondhome.

Audio= 10
Video= 9"
,camo12345,2011-04-01T06:55Z,"2.5mb download speed!! Fantastic, it's downloaded in about 12 minutes :) I wanted to watch this movie straight away and I thought i would have to wait an hour or two for it to download but it was freaky fast! Thanks alot raymond"

,mangosploosh,2011-06-22T10:43Z,"To RoweAlex and Onlythebest2011 and anyone else who might be confused, this is not the 3rd part to the movie nor is it even the 3rd part in a set. This movie is not related to the other 2 ipman movies starting Donny Yen. It is a completely different production all together made by different directors and producers entirely. The only relation is that it is also about Ip Man..."
,LZX1846,2011-07-27T05:36Z,video quality's not that good...but at least the seeds are good
,Powerzeh,2011-08-06T01:23Z,"i liked, thxx"
,Russian23,2011-08-08T22:48Z,Thank you... this is great
,JinJuice,2011-12-11T09:25Z,"Great! this is in Mandarin! the other version I downloaded is Cantonese, and Cantonese sounds like nails on a chalk board to me.

About the English subs, they were great overall except for some of the names are spelled kind of weird."
