Storyline: 

After a horrific car accident, Anna (Ricci) wakes up to find the local funeral director Eliot Deacon (Neeson) preparing her
body for her funeral. Confused, terrified and feeling still very much alive, Anna doesn't believe she's dead, despite the 
funeral director's reassurances that she is merely in transition to the afterlife. Eliot convinces her he has the ability 
to communicate with the dead and is the only one who can help her. Trapped inside the funeral home, with nobody to turn to 
except Eliot, Anna is forced to face her deepest fears and accept her own death. But Anna's grief-stricken boyfriend Paul 
(Long) still can't shake the nagging suspicion that Eliot isn't what he appears to be. As the funeral nears, Paul gets closer 
to unlocking the disturbing truth, but it could be too late; Anna may have already begun to cross over the other side
