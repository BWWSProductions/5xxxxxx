,Manpower777,2010-09-11T11:34Z,Please anyone have a product key for the starter editions? I can't find a working one anywhere... Thank you in advance.
,SmokeShadows,2010-11-20T02:00Z,When i install in VMware it says XP Home Edition....

For the people said this is XP Home Edition, that's normal during setup but when you complete installation you'll find is Starter Edition, this is because Starter is based on Home."
,UltimateGTR,2011-02-06T07:45Z,And btw thanks prathaprabhu a lot for this rare material!
,goldlen,2011-03-05T11:29Z,Any serial for starter edition ???
