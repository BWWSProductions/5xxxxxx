Charles Williams - 21 Novels (epub, pdf)

In the US, Charles Williams is best known today--if he\'s known at all--for his suspense novels, probably because Dead Calm was made into a successful movie starring Nicole Kidman, Sam Neill, and Billy Zane and because Francois Truffaut made The Long Saturday Night into a movie called Confidentially Yours.

I too like his suspense novels, but I like his comedies better and I like his noirs best of all. You might be wondering what the difference is between a suspense novel and a noir novel. Well, it\'s just my way of categorizing Williams\' stories. In the suspense stories the hero finds himself in trouble through no fault of his own and there\'s always a happy ending. In the noirs, the hero makes his own trouble and the endings are Dantesque--that is, they\'re like the punishments dished out in Dante\'s Inferno, always perfectly fitting the crime. In my opinion, the best of these noir stories are Hell Hath No Fury, A Touch of Death, The Big Bite, and Girl Out Back. They make Williams the true heir of James M. Cain, author of The Postman Always Rings Twice and Double Indemnity.

The One That Got Away

The only Williams\' novel missing from this collection is a comedy, Uncle Sagamore and His Girls (1959)--a book hard to find at a reasonable price, unless you speak French. It\'s never gone out of print in France. One reviewer said it\'s funnier than Diamond Bikini. If so, it\'s very, very funny.
