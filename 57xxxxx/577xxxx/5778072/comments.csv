Like many .MOV files this file is a pain in the ass.
Audio but no video.

Vlc, Quicktime, WMP it doesnt matter...

If anyone manages to play this or convert it to a more reliable format plz tell me how to play or post the link here to the new file..."

,ottoskorzeny,2010-08-21T02:15Z,"The video is just the straight up H.264 from the original FLV inside a QT enclosure, because I didn't want to transcode it.  If you can play the original streaming web version, you should be able to play this, but if you want I can re-upload in a different format, just tell me what you prefer."
,WRobN,2010-08-21T15:36Z,"I can play the streaming web version but my pc sucks at showing it nicely without stuttering.
Normal i burn it for my dvd player.

If you can, and if its not to much im asking i would like a other HD version.
It doesnt matter wich format.

Play upload it in another format.

Thanks"

Sorry the file size is larger - I tried uploading a 1MBps DIVX that was about the same size, but I kept getting a weird ""File Size Error"" from TPB.  I think it might be related to the many errors on TOB right now such as not being able to edit torrents.  Anyway after trying a number of things that didn't work (including a text file, putting in a folder, etc.) making the file size larger seemed to do the trick."
