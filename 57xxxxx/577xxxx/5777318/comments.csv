Sorry Mate .... won't be doing Austin Powers

@ arun 

Staxrip & Megui

@ mysassywiz

When bluray is out ....... I will do it

@ devkills

I don't change the aspect ratio ...... It is same as Source. Also no encoder would delibereatly change the aspect ratio, so if my upload has 2.40:1, other similar movies would also have the same Aspect ratio as the source used is generally the same"

,robbaa007,2010-08-21T14:48Z,"btw, where can i find the non-eng subtitles for your rip???"
,wira020,2010-08-21T15:25Z,"Audio: 10..perfect!
Video : 9.5 ...  there's a few loss of detail  but it's just minor... still very watchable IMHO.. plays fine with MPC.. turned on a few shaders and it looks very good... totally better than most 1gb low res avi rips... thanks for this riddlerA!..

The movie is good.. I watch this as someone who admires karate kid's old movie... so it makes it hard for me to like it.. in the end I kinda like it... totally worth watching.. and I'm gonna burn it to dvd for my niece and nephews.. it's very hard nowadays to get a movie suitable for the whole family.."
,wira020,2010-08-21T15:45Z,"Here's some image sample... taken with MPC with enabled Combine Shader : Sharpen complex 2, denoise, 16-225 -> 0-225... there's not much difference with enabled shaders, i enabled it to make my monitor color better...
