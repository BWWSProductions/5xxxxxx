From the Fugitive Audio Restoration Team (F.A.R.T.)
comes this excellent quality video with the original soundtrack restored!

As you probably know, DVD's of season three of The Fugitive were
released with a completely new, synthesized music score, and
incidental music was also replaced.

Now, thanks to the Fugitive Audio Restoration Team, you can
enjoy the show in top quality as it was originally intended to be experienced.
