Place Android Widgets and Shortcuts on your lock screen. Long-press to move items just like in Home. Many settings to config, such as volume keys allowed at lockscreen or trackball unlock.  Optional Easy Wake, use any button 
(volume/camera/trackball) to wake Incredible trackpad may have mixed results. I'm investigating.
