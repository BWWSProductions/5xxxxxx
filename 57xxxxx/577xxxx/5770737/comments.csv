BTW thug do you post for productivity or for leisure or random?  I'd like to find some useful tools that have benefits when you go for paid for versions like titanium backup.  There's only a handful of GOOD apps where you see a benefit when you switch to paid for, or so I think.

Thanks"

,Artificial_Madness,2010-08-25T02:04Z,not saying what you do is crap THUG tho
,Artificial_Madness,2010-08-26T02:20Z,"just a side note, the ad says ""four ways to god"" i think, and if you press it you go to that internet page, i'll uninstall until this is fixed somehow =("
,martinnnemo,2010-08-30T06:05Z,"I'm getting the same ""two second delay for pirates""... that's ok, It's worth the $2 for the app."

,kenmystro,2011-09-30T12:45Z,"have been searching for a media player with the functions in this app, i didnt get that it was seperate thing to get, was so disapointed that it had to be bought, but so happy to find it on here, if this works i will be over the moon. If sum1 can buid it another will crack it!!  As for the guy who had the suggestion of lockbot well if its better why you still searching?? and it cant be because i dont see it on PB!!"
