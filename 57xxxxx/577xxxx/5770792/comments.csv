I really found it quite boring for an action film,
with possibly the worst wigs ever used in a hollywood film. Not that I know much about wigs...other than the fact that they should'nt really look like wigs!
The story was pretty poor and she doesnt half kill a lot of the so called 'goodies' while pretending to be a 'baddie'. Maybe she really is a 'baddie'...as they say ""who is Salt?""... I say that I dont really care."

,umarnawazkhan,2010-09-02T09:07Z,"change your upload video's to MP4 or MKV
for high quality
720p - x264

What is x264?

x264 is an open-source encoder for the H.264 codec used for High-Definition movies on HD-DVDs and Blu-Ray Discs. It has a high compression which is way superior to xvid. That means you get more quality at equal bitrates. A 700MB x264 rip will be sharper and more detailed than a 700MB xvid rip from the same source. x264 is the future in DVDrips!

What is a .mkv file?

MKV means matroska video and it is a extensible open standard Audio/Video container (AVI is a container, too!). This file format combines several video streams, audiostreams, subtitles, chapters and information in only one file. It supports new standards like 6-channel AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) audio or x264 video "

It's too bad that when we try to read the comments on the uploads we have to sift through such BS and childish ignorant language. It makes it harder to find out whats good and whats not.
