I have the standard release, so look forward to the demos, etc. too."

 I have this, and the demos are indeed well worth listening to. However, they made a big mistake in not including the hidden track ('bag lady') which was one of the best songs on the standard edition (and the perfect closer), so get that if you can!

Cheers"
