+[NOTE :: I have included the "Bombshell" article in .pdf form with this torrent.  In spite of Infowar's description, above, the article seems to have been written by Wayne Madsen.  Jones and Dykes appear to have written a 2 paragraph preface to it.]+




Alex also welcomes to the show Joel Skousen, a political commentator non-fiction Survivalist author, retreat consultant and is the founder and chief editor of World Affairs Brief, a weekly news analysis service. Mr. Skousen will talk about Chuck Baldwin's article, Top Secret America: The Rest Of The Story, and the dark side of America's army and secret police.

I have edited that segment out of the "gkjrrs" upload of the whole show in one file at Demonoidand included it as part of this torrent. The net runtime is 37:23. Unfortunately it is 32K bitrate.]+

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
