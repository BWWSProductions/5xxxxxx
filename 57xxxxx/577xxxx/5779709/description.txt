Man, how to get passed the fantastic (but lets face it: really overplayed â€“ thanks Smallville!) â€œSave Meâ€? That song is not only the central piece of the album, but the obvious highlight. The rest of it is a nice yet a bit generic alternative rock album. Sure, there are very interesting moments spread all around, but that central piece makes me loose the focus on the remaining songs. Hell, I will keep on listening to it and maybe Iâ€™ll skip â€œSave Meâ€ to try and get a better perception of the album as a whole.
