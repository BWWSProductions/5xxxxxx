The Boondocks, I am sure that I will have it up in 2-3 days, as long as I dont run in  to any problems, I hope you can wait.  (^_^)"

[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-20T15:24Z,"@ xiphone - It is already on my list, dont worry I will do it, but I am going to start from the beginning with S01 cuz next week is the finale. BTW, last nights episode, I did not see that coming just yet, that is messed p how he found out. 

@ htctouch - I will do it. 

@ haznii - I will do the final season of Lost and I will do Heroes S04, it might take me up to 1-2 weeks, cuz I dont have either of those yet.

@ whoever asked for Dirty Sexy Money  - So far I have episodes 1-7 of S02, I will hopefully get the rest in the next few days and then I will upload S02.
