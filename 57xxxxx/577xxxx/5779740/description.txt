PrisM NOTES:
Well....late on this aswell, but a few have asked so here it is ... for an r5 it was ok ... colours were way off, pretty dark and lacked some other things, started by making a avs script fixing the noise, sharpness and brightness, changed the contrast to balance it all out ... then it was onto the colors, now some may of noticed but it had a heavy green tint over it :(, so i lowered the green a fair bit, increased the red and increased the blue slightly ... to me the colors
look alot better ... chose a bigger size due to keeping a better bitrate...Check sample :) Enjoy !!
