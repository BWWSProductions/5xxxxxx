,artemisdreams,2010-08-21T08:31Z,"Thanks so much for sharing.  I've loved Anne McCaffrey for eons.  However, I downloaded the collection and the second Dragonriders of Pern book (Dragonquest) came through as a .lit.tmp file which I can't seem to open.  (I use Calibre to organize and convert my ebooks.)  Is it possible that you included a temp file rather than the full .lit file for that book?  And if so, any chance you can put up the proper file for that one?  I would be hugely grateful.  Thanks!  In the meantime I'll still keep seeding."
,Sprat3370,2010-08-22T17:21Z,Oops sorry - I've fixed it - if you re-download it should get the second book okay now - it's still got an extension of .tmp dunno how to change the torrent hehe ... so just change the extension and it works fine. Enjoy.
,faeruszorander,2010-08-26T15:21Z,"@sprat3370, hey gr8 upload thx ive been searching for these for agez, i have the same problem as artemisdreams tho, i cant seem to get dragonquest to work, i have redownloaded it twice, tried multiple extension changes to no avail, is there a special version of microsoft reader i need for .tmp files? thx in advance for any help anyone can give me"
,Sprat3370,2010-08-26T20:55Z,"It does work - just make sure Windows is set to view extensions of files - then remove the .tmp at the end of the filename.  If Windows isn't set to view them then it just renames the file without removing the extension.  
To check if it's set this way open My Computer, get to folder options:
Windows 7 it's under the Organise menu
I think it's there too under Vista
XP is under the Tools menu.
Then click view ... you'll see 'hide extensions for known file types' untick it - then you'll be able to rename the offending file properly.
If people are still struggling even with these instructions I'll re-up the torrent for you all."
,Sprat3370,2010-08-26T20:58Z,It does work - you simply need to make sure that windows isn't set to hide file extensions.  I'll re-up the torrent instead.
,Sprat3370,2010-08-26T21:05Z,I've re-upped the torrent and have stopped seeding this one - I will seed the new torrent as much as possible.  Enjoy.
,faeruszorander,2010-08-26T21:40Z,"hey i think my microsoft reader is probs just fail, i already knew what an extension was, and have already done your above fix, just cant seem to find a different version of mr for this:S"
,Sprat3370,2010-08-26T22:12Z,"http://www.microsoft.com/reader/downloads/ppc.aspx

That's where to get it and the version I'm using to view the books.

Get the new torrent instead and that download - it should work fine for you."
,faeruszorander,2010-08-27T02:16Z,"hey i redownloaded the fixed version upload, it works fine, dont know why i coudlnt fix it, must just be my stupid 64bit windows playin up again, ty once again for upload, your a legend"
