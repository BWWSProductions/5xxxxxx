IMAGiNE NOTES
Well here we are with a nice DVD Screener of Twilight Eclipse. Now we had the xvid that was released onto demon yesterday, but before that was even finished downloading we were sent the original dvd vobs by a good mate... Cheers mate you know who you are... ;)
On to the video, its a very nice scr so we just needed to do a few touch ups on it. First we cropped of the timer and watermark that was on the bottom which was not much at all so nothing will be missed, then it was just a matter of a few rgb color changes and a few other small things. The audio is very nice AC-3 audio for a nice crisp sound. All together this is a nice release.

UPLOADER NOTES
IN MY MOST HUMBLE OPINION...IMAGiNE & Rx ARE BEST RELEASES SO FAR...ONLY DIFFERENCE IS IMAGiNE HAS AC3 AUDIO...PLEASE COMMENT :)
