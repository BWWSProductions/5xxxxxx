,stu8975,2010-08-20T08:49Z,Best so far? how is this possible when IMAGINE rsl  been widely reported as missing 3 mins from the end of the film? should be 1hr56min up to when the credits roll..not 1hr53min. Full inc credits 2hr.3min.
,noface77,2010-08-21T06:07Z,Audio and Video are great but i think it is missing some last few min. of the movie.
,unfeddog,2010-09-29T03:34Z,The best would be uploading an ISO of the source....why do they just do a reencode and post xvid. Some people like quality.
