this movie is bad on so many levels. so many story/plot holes so much bad acting from great actors so much political innuendo... i am very disappointed as i usually love Forest Whitaker but this was just sad and painful to watch. "
,Asphalt-Man,2011-02-22T10:15Z,"noklus, NO ONE CARES WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS MOVIE!!!!!!! Just keep your opinions to yourself. Why go on all the different torrents for this movie and complain. SHUT UP! I'd understand if you paid for it but its F@#king FREE. Your Just as bad if not worse than the idiots that place a comment to seed. Like thats gonna make anyone actually go into their files and put it back in their DL/UP list just cause someone thinks its not downloading fast enough. Get real! 99% of people upload and the SECOND its finished they remove it. Bottom line this SH!t is free any we ALL should be thankful someone took the time and risk of uploading for our enjoyment. 

THanks to the uploade
