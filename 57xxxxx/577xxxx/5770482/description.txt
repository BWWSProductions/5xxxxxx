I'm not much of a fan of Gospel music or any sort of music which exalts the lord or God. The only way I could appreciate it is when the voice singing these songs is truly special. Fortunately, Patty sings with an angel's celestial thrust. She lends these songs with grace that allows the songs to breathe from whatever cage they are in. The fourteen songs in this album are examples of adult contemporary music that feels present and modern that even someone like me, who usually cringe at the thought of Middle of the road sap, can listen to it and get swept away into its strong current. I guess, Patty believes there is a power in these songs, in these topics and I think her belief, prominent in her voice, transcends religion preference. That said, this is her weakest album for me although technically, it has a subtle, solemn sound and it gives her voice a perfect place to roam. I just can't accompany her in the journey thoroughly because a force pulls me away from listening blindly.
