Also I want to author the movie myself, not you to do it. I may not like how you authored it, but once you do this, it can't be undone.  Technically it can be undone, but the quality goes down the toilet. Your efforts are appreciated, so don't get me wrong. Look around on TPB, very few up-loaders PRE-Author movie files. LOOK at the seeders..... NO ONE is even bothering to mess with your uploads and the reason is THIS: 
One obvious reason is that many people have players that can read a XVID file from a DVD and those people do not want there movie files to be altered at all,  You can fit 4 2 hr movies in XVID format on 1 DVD. MANY newer players can play XVID and DIVX movie files as-is (until you changed it all around)  AS for the REST of us at TPB, we want the option to decide for ourselves the settings when authoring a movie file to play in a regular DVD player. settings like these: 
The average bit rate, the max bit rate, MOTION ESTIMATION SETTINGS, Video field dominance, ASPECT RATIO, Audio Format, Audio data rate, audio dynamic range compression, and there are many more settings. Settings that may work best for your home theater set up may not be the best settings for mine, or anyones set up for that matter. Again, no ill will to you at all, just my view on this topic. Many thanks, but I'll wait or find this film else where."
