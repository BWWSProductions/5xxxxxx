,DL_King,2010-08-18T05:59Z,"Funny fact: A recent study that the majority people who are homophobic, turn out to be self-loathing homosexuals themselves....

Now That's Funny :D

Don't believe me, then believe the US National Library of Medicine:

,arsenic1016,2010-08-18T06:32Z,BrooklynD - what are you the gay TOP who fucked him last night?  Who cares.
,hox07io,2010-08-19T00:54Z,SEED PLEASE! It's a little hard to download at a s/l ratio of 3:1101. (I will continue to seed for 48h when Im finished downloading this)
,another_dude,2010-08-19T15:33Z,"It would be great if someone could seed the last missing 512kb. I'll continue seeding afterwards, as will probably many others."
,kaizerzero,2010-08-19T18:02Z,"Best to toss this one....switch over to the other 720p:

,kaizerzero,2010-08-19T19:29Z,"Crap....sorry about that. Woke up half asleep, found the torrent below this one in the list, wrote the comment, and went back to sleep.
I'm an ass."
,Ool,2010-08-20T06:04Z,"I'm not sure the torrent is fake, but it's utterly useless because something is preventing the first and the last packet from being seeded, containing the non-video files and a chunk of the video.  Recently there was a torrent stuck at 99% with only the end of the video missing and that one could still be played, but this one I can't even repair using any of the MKV tools I know..."
,Ool,2010-08-20T06:19Z,"My guess is, someone who has the complete video file but not the text files inserted the video file and started leeching the torrent, thus seeding all the parts they had minus the parts containing files they didn't have.  And the person who made the torrent never even seeded it in the first place.  My suggestion would be to that person who has the video to make another torrent file without the text junk and seed that themselves. because this is helping nobody.

Or maybe the original seeder accidentally deleted the text files before they were finished seeding.  Either way, this sucks!"
,OlinaDeLaHoya,2010-08-20T07:50Z,"This newly released torrent's is impossible to download, can you release it again thx ?"
,noname408,2010-08-21T20:40Z,"SEEEEEEEEED!!!!
stuck at 99.9 for three days now!"
,OlinaDeLaHoya,2010-08-22T03:33Z,"To all !

There is noting wrong with the seed, the big problem is with the upload, they most upload it again for it to work, until then nobody will be able download it.
TvTeam released several torrents on the 17:e and 18:e and this problem is in several of them.
I really hope they release this torrents again ! "
,Waratteta,2010-08-22T12:28Z,"Would TVTeam like to share the last .1% with the class, or are they keeping this episode to themselves?"
,another_dude,2010-08-22T14:56Z,"Seems like someone at last added one of the two missing chunks, containing the video header.
Now MPC could play the file, even if there are still 256kb missing somewhere - I didn't even see any corresponding artifacts during playback.
Will continue uploading somewhat..."
,Cwluc,2010-08-23T08:06Z,I'd kill for someone to fix this torrent...
,KnightOwl70,2010-08-26T07:12Z,"It took some creativity but I recreated the nfo file by using an IMMERSE nfo from another torrent, the partial nfo posted above, and some guessing.

That and I got the show from a cyber locker.

Your welcome."
