Includes:

Everyone's A Little Bit Gay (early version of a track that appeared on the 2010 edition of 21 Concepts), Hall Pass [I get what he's saying on that track, for sure], Gopher Guts, Reaping Beauty, Dreidel Playa, Nerdcore Hiphop Is Fun, and Watch Out I'm Doing Cocaine And Running The Country In Twenty Years

Also includes the 'Eviction Notice' diss tape aimed at Lars after the nerdcore drama.
