The classic cartoon chase involving forever frustrated feline Tom and mightily mobile mouse Jerry got spun in new and deliciously inventive way when animation legend Chuck Jones set up shot at the team's home studio and produced the 34 wonderful shorts in this Collection.

Tom got furrier cheeks and thicker eyebrows, Jerry got larger eyes and ears and a more sweet natured expression, but Jones and his collaborators put them through their hilarious misadventure with renewed personality and style and also cleverly parodied pop culture as well.
