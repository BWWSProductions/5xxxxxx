I'm still using 2.5 i cant get the mik4 or 5 ""demos"" to work. any chance of an upload. in return i can supply lots of old skool also recent fidget and even older funk and soul. mostly from here and there but I run every track through tagscanner - mp3 gain - mixed in key  for perfect digital DJ use.  PEACE OUT BRO!"
