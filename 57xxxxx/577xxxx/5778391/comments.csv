,punk420,2010-08-21T18:52Z,i've uploaded nearly 2gb for this fucking torrent i'm not doing it any more.....
,]eep,2010-08-22T00:55Z,"I think first a THANK YOU would be in order. It is perfectly possible to make a more than decent 720p in 500MB. It is allready proven by ~PlutO~, YIFI and RiddlerA.  

But now my question: why go to all this trouble when there are 3 other good 720p ~500MB versions around that are still seeded?
