Any chance you could reseed or reup the Part 4 of Ozric Tentacles. I have managed to retrace everything else. You would remain my number one fave pirate if you were able to see your way to it. Thank you, my brudda and keep up the good work. You may remember me...my previous handle was MT_Head, but that seems to have gotten lost with the changes to TPB."
