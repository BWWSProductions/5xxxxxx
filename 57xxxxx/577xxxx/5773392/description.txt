Ive had re-occuring comp problems,  it sucks for me, this is why im late! Sorry some of you couldn't play the MP4s, your frusterations are understood after a large download.  But this era of pre-releases has sadly came to an end.  The source server has efficiently destroyed my way to grab the files, even if they are posted.  Best thing possible, I find a work around, Possible, I can grab from website once its 100% publicly on the webs, or the worst, The Scene rips will have to do, once they come out, days later in most cases.... :(

For now here is the 480p of s10ep17, enjoy...

Xvid up soon...  ep 18 still needs to be encoded, so I make no promises, but I want it up tomorrow....

(the worst part about this is, Im turning on my tv,  I tend to avoid those mindwashers)
