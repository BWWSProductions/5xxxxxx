,shauwy,2010-08-20T21:18Z,works!!! thanx man but the city are very very many BUGss but you can explore the city and it's always good thanx
,anuzbitt,2010-08-21T12:22Z,hmm steam seems to have released a fix that makes the time unlimited useless :/ dont use steam :D i guess 
,anuzbitt,2010-08-21T12:32Z,oh and btw if anyone of u guys didnt knew the trick with the Physx on the game characters clothes that they make your pc lag with unnecessary force !!! u can go to the mafia 2 folder/edit/APEX/ and remove the entire cloth folder = mabye back it up! but nothing will inflict with the game all is still working and the game runs 10 times more smoothly ! try it out 
,xiIix,2010-08-21T13:18Z,"Remove the ENTIRE cloth folder? WTF guys... All you need to do is remove the long dresses and the slowdown in front of the house is gone. Just remove the files that have CPROS in their name. Like CPROS1L_CPROS1L.aca. And .acml.

And that's if you're even having slowdowns that are that bad. I'm not having any game-breaking slowdowns at all with all the cloth enabled. The only time there is a slowdown below 40fps (GTX460 1GB) is when you're right in front of your house, and that's because the developers made a BUNCH of ladies with their long dresses spawn there. There are no other areas in the demo that are like that. Once you leave that immediate area in front of your house you'll never see another area where they will spawn like that.

But, if you insist on getting rid of it, go ahead and remove the dresses like I explained. Just don't remove the entire folder, that's overkill."
,xiIix,2010-08-21T13:26Z,"Fuck, steam did fix the time limit patch. This sucks balls. I hope someone fixes this bullshit."
,anuzbitt,2010-08-21T13:56Z,oh well i got it off a nvidia forum site so i just went with thier instructions remove the entire cloth folder but anyhow i got a few silly lags at high speed when i go thru the area with the gun shop and of course in front of the house... so the fix with deleting is a life saver :D but for the steam fix patch im downloading a demoniod mafia 2 demo which i hope is the old steam demo :D not fixed with silly steam patch :P
,korlaeda,2010-08-21T14:37Z,"Steam just updated your mafia demo. All you need is to disable autoupdate in steam, repleace the new mafia2.exe with the old one(22.9MB), and patch it."
,anuzbitt,2010-08-21T14:55Z,"i sadly didnt save the mafia 2 exe :( but i found this newly cracked trainer check this out
