 http://www.TruthKnights.com. This is Ahmad Deedat's excellent debate with Dr. of divinity and philosophy Anis Shorrosh, labeled "The Qur'an or the bible, which is God's word?"

The debate tackles the pros and cons of the 2 books, their origins, authors, claims and fruits.

This debate is 3 parts. The main part, the Q & A part and the third part which is a sequel of the debate. On the debate Ahmad Deedat challenged any and all of UK's priests and clergymen to a debate the following day. This was a no-show on the Christian part, so shaikh Deedat delivered a lecture as a sequel to the debate with Shorrosh.

A must see for all Muslims and Christians.
