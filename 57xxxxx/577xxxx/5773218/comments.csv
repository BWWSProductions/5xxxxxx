Only one problem: track 12 - 2:1 is missing (probably because of "":"" in file name?)"
,matriarchies,2010-08-30T03:38Z,"kris_jag, thanks for the feedback.

Track 12 does exist in this torrent, as you can verify by clicking the ""50"" right after ""Files:"" at the top of this page, but your torrent client might not be showing it, or it might not be saving it correctly.  For now, try to find a way to change your local file names from within your torrent client, or try a torrent client that will let you do that (or one that will replace/strip characters that your OS doesn't support).

In the future, I'll be more mindful of special characters.  Sorry for the inconvenience."

Yes, it was fault of my torrent client - track 2:1 has been actually downloaded, but with some strange file name and I missed it. I changed extension to flac and now everything is OK.
Thank you again for share!!!"
