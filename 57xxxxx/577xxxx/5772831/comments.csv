,thunderbum,2010-08-19T06:20Z,"JW - would you or anyone here know where I can find a torrent for Sean Hannity from this past Monday the 16th. I've looked everywhere I can think of and Googled until my eyes got blurry. No joy.

I heard that it was one of his best radio programs yet... Thanks in advance for any/all help."
