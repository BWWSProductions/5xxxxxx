This is all of season on in iPad format.

I have a slow connection and this is 13GB so it will take time.

If you have season one already, you would be better off downloading the free converter and doing it yourself, it is pretty easy to do.

Aleesoft Free iPad Video Converter 

Just google it and you will find it.

Its what I used to convert these, the best bit is its free.
