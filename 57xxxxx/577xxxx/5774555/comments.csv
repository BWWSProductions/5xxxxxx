,tbraybrook,2011-08-26T21:06Z,Well it is a no brainer how to do this but this didn't work for me. I am using Windows 7 and copied it into several places. I now have files all over the place and it does not work. I am now forced to uninstall the whole FN Ashampoo and reinstall it because of files all over the place now and not know which ones will mess up the program if I delete them.
