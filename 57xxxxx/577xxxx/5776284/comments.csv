I had to finish this off from an alternative source.  I renamed it to get 100% now I will switch the names back to help all you useless n00bs that are stuck at 99.9% and don't know what to do..."
,QborT,2010-08-20T16:11Z,I spoke/typed too soon.  Can't be done.  TvTeam screwed something up with the rip.  doesn't look like it will ever get to 100%
