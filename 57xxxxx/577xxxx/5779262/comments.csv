,EZ123,2010-08-21T07:52Z,"Yea I Love These, I Believe I'm Seeding. Once I Upload It Doesn't That Mean I'm Seeding?"
,pixiesmiles,2010-08-21T11:47Z,"Yes, and no.  You need to have your torrent client (like Utorrent, bitorrent, etc) up and running, and the torrent you are seeding active. So... you want to click on this torrent in the list of torrents visible in your torrent client, and then click the button to start it, the same way you would if it were a torrent you were downloading from someone else. If you don't do these things, nobody will be able to connect to you in order to download.  You'll need to seed your torrent at least until 1 or more people have downloaded it completely and are allowing others to download from them by continuing to seed it.  

I hope this makes sense?  If not... just say the word and I'll try to clarify.  

Again... thanks for sharing! :)"
,EZ123,2010-08-21T20:24Z,"that makes perfect sense, no wonder no one is really downloading them thanks i'll start seeding now"
,EZ123,2010-08-21T20:26Z,Idk If My Comment Showed But Thanks I Will Seed
,pixiesmiles,2010-08-23T01:20Z,"Yep, your comment showed.  Sometimes they don't appear until the page is refreshed.  Glad my explanation made sense!  Happy seeding.. :)"
