I instantly fell in love with Laura Veirs' voice the first time I heard her singing (that was on "Yankee Bayonet", from The Decemberists' The Crane Wife). She's got a little extra something that appeals to me in the most peculiar way, and the fact that she's also a great songwriter doesn't hurt either. Yet, I've always felt that her previous albums (well, those I own), although very good in their own right, never really achieved to fulfill the potential of greatness I could see in her. That's exactly what July Flame does: it's an inspired, focused, and constantly great album. Laura's vocal melodies attain such a level of brilliance ("When You Give Your Heart", anyone?) that's mesmerizing. The scaled-down arrangements are also a treat, as they add some kind of mystical atmosphere to the record, which reaches its peak with the haunting "Little Deschutes" and the gorgeous "Make Something Good". July Flame actually reminds me of another favorite of mine, Patty Griffin's 1000 Kisses. Maybe it all comes down to the fact that both were crafted at home?
