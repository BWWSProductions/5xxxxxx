Ripper's Notes |:

The dvdrip from Miyagi has no English subtitles for the Chinese
speaking  scenes, moreover, it is actually not from R3 DVD, instead,
it is "castrated", as Chinese people say, by the State Administration of
Radio, Film, and Television of China, which results in the fact that a
total length of 8 minutes scenes were cut out to accomodate laws and
regulations in China.
Hereby we proudly present a full length theatrical cut release and hope
you will enjoy.
