Bobby Brown's follow-up to the groundbreaking Don't Be Cruel isn't as innovative or consistent as his previous album, but that doesn't mean it's without any charms. The singles "Humpin' Around," "Good Enough," and "Get Away" are strong and memorable, which makes any of pleasant filler forgivable, and the seamless production makes it all listenable. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide
