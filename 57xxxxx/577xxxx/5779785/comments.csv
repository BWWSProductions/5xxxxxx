,ddawg,2010-08-21T12:06Z,It appears as if all tracks have been transcoded
,skepticsheep,2010-08-21T17:11Z,Why is that? Maybe I've done something wrong during the ripping process.
,ddawg,2010-08-21T18:02Z,"I don't know... I ran audiochecker on them and they all came up with 90# MPEG and I was getting a strange null error on the time when I checked them with Medieval CUE Splitter.

I rip with winamp.  Please check your files with audiochecker and if you're getting the same errors I am please reup as this is one CD that's difficult to find.

Thanks for sharing"
