,Xiahagh,2010-08-21T22:32Z,"Works fine, thanks.

How to install:

1. Run Setup.exe. This will install Steam if you don't have it installed.
2. When setup asks for activation, simply minimize it and run steambackup.exe.
3. Select your Steam folder (C:\Program Files\Steam by default).
4. Wait until steambackup finishes, it may take up to 10 min.
5. Press Cancel in Steam setup.
6. In your Steam folder you'll find subfolder named ""Kane & Lynch 2- Dog Days"". Open it and copy crack from Crack folder on iso there.

That's it.

Few more tips:

- You don't need any serial number.
- You don't need to uninstall Steam before game setup if you have it installed.
- You may uninstall Steam afterwards if you don't need it as the game doesn't require it running."
,Xiahagh,2010-08-22T11:11Z,"Looks like I've fucked up with my tutorial. 

You just want to run steambackup.exe and tell it where to install — like D:\Games or something. You don't need Steam for this at all."

Advice: You have to put your antivirus to sleep before the installation otherwise steam-backup will not work. 

As much as I loved first one, Dog Days is a complete shit. It suppose to be realistic action shooter but this is some kind of sick experiment from Eidos. Shooting - crap, graphics crap etc..."

There was no climax to the story, Lynch's insanity wasn't even PRESENT in the damn game, nor did it cause any problems for Kane. All he did was kill some high up dude, but that was revenge ANY of us would've sank out teeth into, not insanity or instability. This is just horrible and lazy, and I would be so flaming pissed off if I had spent fifty fucking dollars on this game. Holy shit am I glad I tried it here first.
