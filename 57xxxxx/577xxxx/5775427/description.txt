For a while now I've been wanting to do this So here it is the first
 of many to come: A complete Oblivians discography!  This will probably 
take a few years and cost me about 500-1000 more(I just spent 325 on
a test pressing) before I am finished.



All of these rips are original presses unless noted. Also the only reason I will 
rip a reissue is just for being a fag about it and I already have ripped 
the origianl!
