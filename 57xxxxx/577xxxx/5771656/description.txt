Welcome to Good Music Episode #2! 

This one sure should get you going, special uplifting episode containing old and new trance tracks!

In this one i use a different mixing technique using lp/hp filter sweeps instead of the normal filters and it works great on uplifting tracks that are in key.

I managed to squeeze in 6 trance tracks on 10 minutes, enjoy

Tracklist: 
Ronski Speed & Sebastian Sand - Sole Survivor (Ronski Speed Mix)
Oceania - Squares In Boxes (Suncatcher Remix)
Suntacher - Wildflowers (Original Mix)
Juventa - Sapphire (Suncatcher Remix)
Plastic Angel - Try Walking In My World (Daniel Kandi Rising Mix)
Phillip Alpha - Sudden Changes (Original Mix)
