[T],solstars,2010-08-19T20:48Z,NOTE:  59.940 fps version.
[T],solstars,2010-08-20T05:00Z,I will also up a 23.97 fps version if anyone wants it.  I know some have had issues playing the higher frame rates on some equipment.
,mco,2010-08-20T14:31Z,Would love to se a 23.97 fp version. Love the move and if you could upload the lower fps-rate version that would be awsome. Thanks in advance
[T],solstars,2010-09-10T04:36Z,24fps version at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5821950/
[T],solstars,2010-09-10T04:47Z,23.976 fps version at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5821950/Tron_(1982)_-_HDTV_720P_-_Dolby_Digital_AC3_-_NO_LOGOS_24fps
,gnomad,2010-10-29T16:05Z,A/V sync issues on playback.  :(
[T],solstars,2010-11-05T16:19Z,Where are the sync problems?  I don't see it in my copy.  I still have the source so I can fix if you tell me where to look.
,e114612,2010-11-11T02:24Z,"yeah, def sync issues starting at the 5 min mark. Tried MPC and WMP. I'm using the latest CCC pack and I also tried it on my powerhouse of a desktop with the same problem on the same time"
,jeanphilt,2010-11-15T02:02Z,which version should I download ?
[T],solstars,2010-11-27T19:17Z,"I'm playing in VLC and in Mediaportal.  Not sseing the issue, but I'm going to assume this is a problem with the 60fps framerate.  The 24fps version I posted is identical source and same quality.  No complaints posted there about the A/V sync problem."
,Zucrham,2010-12-28T02:42Z,Could you upload a subbed version? English or Norwegian subs if possible :)
