,MitsEvX,2010-08-21T11:32Z,"@Jan-Bertil: Trance music is the best genre of music to put your emotion in, in my opinion. A kid generally isn't able to do that, (that much) so that's why I think kids don't like trance in a same level as older people! So, what's your age? :P

Thanks again and again Inspiron :D"
