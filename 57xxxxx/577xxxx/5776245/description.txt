Switched OS to 7 and now one of the steps in encoding is fucked, audio isnt getting encoded, it may be lack of drivers installed, idk atm, but the last steps worked, thats why I was able to post the last few xvids.

I will fix this, but again like the last whole week, I can\\\'t fully promise when...

Anyway, want to watch this, so Im gonna let you go! :P
