I love this show, I cant wait for the second season to air, which is scheduled for November 2010.

This show has one of the guys from The Tudors in it.

Show Nfo - A group of kids doing community service get struck by lightning during a storm, and begin to develop superpowers. 

Review - Never have I laughed so much at a bunch of snotty, revolting weirdos who should be deserted on a remote island for the sake of the rest of us. Have just finished watching episode 6 and am dying for another series to be made. Episode 2 made me snort my tea through my nose with laughter/horror/revulsion, it was epic.

I don\'t get the comparisons with Heroes - other than the \'superpowers\', this bears no resemblance to the \'save-the-world\' schtick and good-v-evil piety Heroes is full of. This is definitely black (with a collection of mottled stains that it\'s best not to ask about). I\'m still undecided about Simon (sweet underneath or fundamental embryonic psychopath); I\'d have to throttle Nathan if he were my offspring, but he\'s a joy to watch, I look forward to the series\' \'ressurrection\'......
