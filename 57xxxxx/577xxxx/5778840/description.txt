Music : Classical : Lossless


This set has become, in the minds of many chamber music enthusiasts, the definitive modern recording of the Beethoven String Quartets.

I cannot disagree with this endorsement. The playing is sublime, the interpretations profound and the quality of the recorded sound is excellent throughout.

In this landmark series of recordings
the Takacs Quartet manage to supplant the Quartetto Italiano as the benchmark
Beethoven series for the 21st century.

A must for anyone's collection.


Enjoy and Seed!!
