As a boy, Tommy (Fredric Lehne) swore to his dying father he would never fight, a promise he kept, even refusing to join the military during World War II. But when Tommy's fiancÃ©e is raped, can he remain a pacifist -- or will he violently avenge the wrong? Based on the hit Kenny Rogers song and co-starring the silver-maned singer, this compelling film explores the tensions that arise between ideals and passion, between promises, duty and honor.
