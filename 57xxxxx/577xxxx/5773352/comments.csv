Needed way better casting and a whole of a-lot better script."
,theRealKarmine,2011-02-22T05:32Z,"it needed massive explosions that blow holes into the ground and wipe out cities.  and of course the famous ""crapping your pants"" powering up scenes."

,frumpypanda,2012-06-03T03:50Z,"honest impression from a non weaboo;
i liked the end, it was very dbz esque. the first 3/4 of the movie was stupid. white goku? well he's saiyan, so he's not asian but he's probably not white either. the actor made lil sense in a racial way.
i'm yarrring this one so i can watch the last 1/4 of the movie. that's about it."
