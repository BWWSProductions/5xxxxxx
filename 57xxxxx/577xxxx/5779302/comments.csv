Well it's a biatch to download but through no fault of yours my dear, I appreciate your efforts, but there are not really many helping the cause and assisting us in the re-seeiding for other users. It's nigh on impossible to get the 1st series online except from your good self so I just wanted to say I'm in for more than a penny my lovely and once downloaded as many ep's from series 1 as I can get, I will give you the thumbs up and goody feedback and let you know that I do appreciate the time and effort you have taken out of your life to cheer me up in the bits and bobs gaps of mine that can only be enhanced by laughing. Hopefully this message will encourage other users with earlier, current and later episodes to re-seed, as opposed to just leech so that new viewsers just starting out on the second series screening can back watch and catch up without forking out so big up to you and thumbs up from me-I AM chuffed for one :) Cheers!"
