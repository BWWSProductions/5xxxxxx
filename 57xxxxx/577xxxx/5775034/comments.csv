Thanks to enriqo"
,alex0008,2010-08-21T08:06Z,"Audio and video look good, but one problem -- the aspect ratio is off a bit.

I fixed it easily:
Download MP4Box (very popular free app).  I get most of my video progs through Videohelp -- http://www.videohelp.com/tools/mp4box

Put 'libgpac.dll' and 'MP4Box.exe' in same dir as this torrent.
Open a command prompt to that dir and enter:
MP4Box.exe -par 1=64:63 -add The Twilight Saga Eclipse 2010.mp4 -new output.mp4

THERE ARE SPACES IN THE FILE NAME SO YOU MUST PUT QUOTES AROUND IT, but Pirate Bay if messed up right now, so if I had included the quotes the command it would have looked like this: ""The Twilight Saga Eclipse 2010.mp4""

This will LOSSLESSLY rewrite the file with an almost 1:1 aspect ratio.
I compared the Eclipsed sun a 2min-20sec, to an image of an Eclipse poster to figure out
what the correct ratio should be.
The output will be called 'output.mp4'

A faster way is to ALTER THE ORIGINAL FILE instead of creating a new one:
(THE FOLLOWING COMMAND WILL ALTER THE ORIGINAL FILE,
MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SEED WITHOUT DOWNLOADING THE WHOLE TORRENT AGAIN)
(you'll need to quote the file name).
mp4box.exe -par =64:63 The Twilight Saga Eclipse 2010.mp4


Also -- I read on another one of these DVDscr's that the bottom was slightly cropped out.
Twice during this video there is a text message about ""this screener has been uniquely
watermarked so if you share it we'll know it was you"".
I assume that any pirate worth his salt has cropped out his watermark, so most/all off
the screeners will have a slight crop.

Thanks to uploader :)"

VLC v1.1.3
MPC Home Cinema x64"
,honeybaby,2010-09-14T12:04Z,"hmm you know what alex0008, you are right.  Tested on VLC on computer and it plays thru.  When I play it on the media player, it stops 3/4 of the way.... I wonder why.  "
,alex0008,2010-09-15T10:45Z,"@honeybaby
I don't know.  Perhaps try doing what I suggested in my first reply to this torrent.
IIRC the file changes size so I assume it changes more than just one setting, and maybe mp4box.exe writes the file better than whatever the uploader (or his source) used.  It's lossless, so can't hurt."
