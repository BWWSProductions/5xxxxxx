Sunshine Official OST - FLAC

This is REAL. I converted the .m4a files (original files from iTunes) into lossless wav, then from wav into FLAC.

I also included an alternative version to "Sunshine (Adagio in D Minor)". This alternative version doesn't have any vocals like the official iTunes version has. I am not sure of the source of it, but it's lossless.

Enjoy...a simple thanks would be nice :)
