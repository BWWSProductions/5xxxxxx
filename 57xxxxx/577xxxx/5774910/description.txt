    Professor Robert Bartlett explores the impact of the       
    Normans on southern Europe and the Middle East. The       
    Normans spread south in the 11th century, winning        
    control of southern Italy and the island of Sicily.       
    There they created their most prosperous kingdom, where    
    Christianity and Islam co-existed in relative harmony     
    and mutual tolerance. It became a great centre of        
    medieval culture and learning.                            
                                                               
    But events in the Middle East provoked the more           
    aggressive side of the Norman character. In 1095, the    
    Normans enthusiastically answered the Pope's call for     
    holy war against Islam and joined the first crusade.       
    They lay siege to Jerusalem and eventually helped win     
    back the holy city from the muslims. This bloody         
    conquest left a deep rift between Christianity and        
    Islam which is still being felt to this day.
