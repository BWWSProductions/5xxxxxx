          Release notes:
       
          FileMaker Pro is powerful enough to handle most database
          jobs yet easy enough to create simple solutions in minutes.
          This practical "how to" course by FileMaker expert John
          Mark Osborne, starts from advanced level and uses a single
          invoicing example to demonstrate FileMaker Pro 7, 8, 8.5,
          9, 10 and 11 features and techniques including the Ultimate
          Find, saving a found set of records for future retrieval,
          saving find criteria for future use, text parsing to create
          features, making new requests easier for users, parsing web
          form generated emails, five methods for deleting duplicates,
          recursive phone filter, creating preferences in a single-user
          and multi-user scenario, web-like back and forward buttons,
          conditional buttons, custom form letters, changing text
          attributes with scripts, script triggers and many more
          techniques with an emphasis on adaptive scripting and
          calculations. Examples of the invoice file are provided at
          every stage of the creation process so the user can easily
          review one section without starting from the beginning.
