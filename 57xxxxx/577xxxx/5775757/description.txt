The Big C S01E01

Enjoy and please help me seed, so I can release more stuff faster! (^_^)

This comes on Showtime. It has the girl for Precious.

Tagline - Time to grab life by the balls. 

Show Nfo - A suburban mom, diagnosed with cancer, tries to find the humor in the disease. 

Review - I'm giving it 7 because from the pilot it has a lot of potential, and hopefully will mature nicely. Some bits were very very funny, some bits tried hard but weren't funny.

The son and husbands characters need to be refined because they were not quite there, but Laura Linney was very good and plays the lead role well. The the emotion and reactions seemed believable, i hope that it doesn't try and jam morals down the viewers throat (eg. scrubs) because it is clever enough to do more than that.

I'm going to watch the next one with interest and hope it goes up to a 9/10.
