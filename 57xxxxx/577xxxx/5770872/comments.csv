,dontfearreaper,2010-08-18T20:49Z,"other commenters this is the second day yesterday was the release date and this is the same copy i got on demonoid last night the quality on the video is kinda poor but it is designed to be watched on an ipod that is why it looks so poor i already put it on my ipod and it looks pretty damned good... no offense is meant to you wikkid but i actually read the info you posted and thought that these kids need to learn what they were talking about just like any icp fan you need to know what you are talking about and find the true meanings in the lyrics remember ""the baseball bat symbolizes our shattered childhood"" (squidbillies reference comes in handy because it is true)"
