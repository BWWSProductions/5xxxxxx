,donki,2011-03-29T18:46Z,"The fact that MKV & TS are NOT listed as input formats should have been a big enough clue to tell me that this piece of crap is useless for editing such. BUT it does say HD??? 

I guess this is for home recored HD movies and shit and not for editing rips. :(

My search continues."
