,MINZEZ,2010-08-18T02:38Z,"@ steo05
This is in avi format.
But for any video not in avi format window media player, media player classic, VLC and other video playback programs should be able to play them.
Windows media player may require a codec but that can be found in the k Lite codec pack.
The latest version of VLC should play everything.
If the video does not play and asks you to subscribe to some shit to get the codec then its a scam. DELETE it and download another version.
If the video still does not play then it is probably not a video format or is corrupted. Download another version.

Hope that clears things up for ya."

,jimmycrackcorn45,2010-08-19T00:37Z,"It's goes out of sync because MP3 audio tracks do not contain synchronization information found in audio codecs that are designed for use with video. A word to encoders - stop using MP3 audio it will ALWAYS go out of sync. Always, no exceptions! In this respect even MP2 audio is better!"
