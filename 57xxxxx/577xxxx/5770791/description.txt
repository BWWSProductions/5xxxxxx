This has become one of my favorite episodes, 
in which Trampas is falsely accused and convicted of murder.

Then again...any story in which one of the regulars 
is accused of murder is interesting! 

Guest Stars Victor Jory, Parley Baer, Kent Smith, 
Bill Quinn (as the judge), and Harrison Ford 
in a minor, non-speaking role. Ford had some lines 
and bit more to do in the previous season episode 
' The Modoc Kid ', in which John Saxon played The Modoc Kid.
