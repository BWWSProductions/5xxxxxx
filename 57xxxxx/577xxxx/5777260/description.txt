KÃ©t fÃ©lido a pokolban / Two Half Times in Hell (1961)

The Hungarian movie KÃ©t fÃ©lido a pokolban / Two Half Times in Hell by renowned director Zoltan Fabri is simply the finest football movie ever made, be it the themes it represents using the game or the manner in which the final match it done. For a movie made in 1961, nothing today can match up to the mastery with which the entire movie is brought together. Its own remake by John Huston in 1981 Escape to Victory couldnt touch it with a ten-foot pole.

During World War II in German occupied Hungary, a labor camp made of Hungarian nationals is asked to form a football team & play against a German army team to commemorate Hitlerâ€™s birthday. The Hungarian team is led by former star footballer Onodi II (Sinkovits Imre) whoâ€™s affectionately nicknamed Dio. Dio regards the game as sacred & the only way heâ€™d play the match is if he & his players are given proper equipment & extra rations which causes quite a lot of friction between the non-players & some other prisoners in the camp. The players are glad that they are getting the extra ration & do not have to work either till the match takes place. Some even would like to attempt an escape but Dio, suddenly reunited with Football, which he loves more than anything else in this world, would only want to play the game & win it. 

The story is supposedly based on the true story of the Ukrainian football club Dynamo Kyiv whose players defeated a German army team while the Nazis had occupied Ukariane in World War II and further rumors say that the team was shot dead after their victory.

The climatic encounter between the two teams is a nail-biter assured to have you on the edge of your seat. The best part about the movie is that unlike most other football movies, the director chooses not to shoot the match like a live match but rather play around with different camera angles only possible in a movie; this also helps keep the camera steady while providing us with a more coherent view of the happenings on the field.

In all the movies one has seen, rarely has one come across someone as naturally charismatic as Sinkovits Imre who plays Dio. In a scene towards the end while everyone lies on the ground to avoid detection by a group of Russian bombers flying overhead, the camp supervisor begs of him to miss a penalty so that the Germans do not get enraged and so does a teammate in hope that their lives would be spared but all Dio does is give a wicked one sided grin, looking straight ahead and you know heâ€™s not going to listen to anyone or even to reason. 

The movie maintains a downbeat and somber tone that begs to be lifted by a successful match where you want to see the Hungarians pulverize the Germans and when Dio does start scoring you will surely be cheering. The movie is a natural crowd-pleaser that will stay with you long after you are done watching it.
