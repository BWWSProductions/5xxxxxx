,shitfuckpiss,2010-08-19T12:16Z,are these extra missions for campaign or coop ?
[V],globeplus,2010-08-19T12:37Z,"This mextra missions are the arcade mode on the menu of the main game , it is called like that ."
,shitfuckpiss,2010-08-19T13:05Z,i love me a fast response thanks. not all arcade missions were unlocked tho maby somehow i did it wrong 
,lilipop,2010-08-19T13:09Z,"one question. how can i extract the file?
i tried with winrar and with stuffit...did not work -.-"
,lilipop,2010-08-19T13:26Z,ok...sry....freearc is the solution ^^
[V],globeplus,2010-08-19T13:31Z,"the single player mode is 2.6 gb and this extra missions file is 735 mb , this is a innivative method for game with nice extra missions that of course are separated of the main game , foe the 1st time you can play only the extra missions while waitig for example for the main file and you can still integrate them on the main file in a easy way , for the 1st time is possible to play only the extra missions of a nice pc game , to download the main game have shorter size with the extra missions in other file and because is not too much size to extra missions , you can start playing in a nuce way the extra missions waiting for the main file , this is a new fantastic conception for games with nice extra missions , i  just hope to be possuble to use this conception more times in other nice pc games ."
,FoxKnob,2010-08-19T23:53Z,"Globe could you please help me, i have 27 gigs so that isnt the problem but im getting a bluescreen everytime i try to open k&l2.exe i dunno why. it says may not have enough space but do."
[V],globeplus,2010-08-21T12:12Z,"To FoxKnob : i think the computer maybe is interpretating the use of normal space for the normal funcionality of the operative system and in that perspective everything that you can save on discs help getting more space then you just use the discs when you need , another nice suggestion is a not too expensive external hard drive , for a really nice price you get 150 , 200 or 300 gb at least extra space and that donĂÂ´t interfere or prejudicate anything on the computer and certainly you feel more free to go , the blue screens are borring and i understand your perspective because you still have the space but having some really free space helps in the fluent work of the operative system , so i hope you run the game soon as possible and if you want follow my suggestions becaise i think you will be a more happy guy using your computer if you do that ."
,FoxKnob,2010-08-22T02:58Z,"Ya i deff need to get an external. I downloaded a diff torrent, installed full game and when i try to run it its givin me the same bluscreen. i know my system can handle it too. have a decent 9400 nvida gt, dual core proc. 4gig. Why would it give me a blue screen?"
