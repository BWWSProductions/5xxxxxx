               So for every comment i will seed an other full ratio = 100%
                and for any thanks it will be = 50%""
Why even bother if you aren't going to seed.
You seem to be getting all upset about leachers, but that comes with the territory, either get over it or don't bother posting at all, then you don't have to worry about whether others help seed or not.

50% for thanks, for what? if you aren't sharing, who should give you thanks?
100% for comments, well here's one, the only one, and it's negative, cause you're not sharing.

Seed and stop crying or just stop posting."
