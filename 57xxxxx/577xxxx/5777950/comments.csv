,Green-Banana,2010-08-29T19:45Z,This would seem to be an older version.  Interesting.  Why upload an older version of the program?  I'm genuinely curious about this.  Does it manage to get around Trillian's invasive auto-updates which render each new release moot after a brief while?  So we don't actually need to wait for 4.2.0.22 and can instead use this version which you have provided here?  I'm just interested in the release of an older version if old versions generally are forced into updating into non-cracked versions by Trillian.

Because newer does not always mean better.  Heh.

Incidentally, this is the last released version of Trillian 3.1 and Trillian Astra is forcefully outdated at this point, despite Trillian 5 still being in BETA.  Also, Pro subscribers of Astra get a discount on 5, but no free rides.  Weak sauce."
,Green-Banana,2010-09-08T16:27Z,"I see, so what you're implying is that this version won't automatically update like later versions will.  Because later versions (such as 4.2.0.22) are unusable due to the fact that they automatically update to an unusable version as soon as you try to log on.  

""Because newer does not always mean better. Heh.""
So therefore this version is usable as explained above, as ""usable"" would be the first step in ""better"" compared to the later versions.  Thanks!  "
