,samsmomie24,2010-08-20T06:32Z,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!  I have been WAITING for this!!!!!"
,samsmomie24,2010-08-20T07:56Z,When I try to unzip it asks me to install a disk or it says the file is corrupt.  Suggestions??
[V],MAFIAA.,2010-08-20T17:00Z,@samsmomie24 Try WinRAR latest version..
,samsmomie24,2010-08-20T22:20Z,Downloaded WinRar and it worked like a charm...thanks!!!
,MosaicM,2010-08-21T20:05Z,Got winrar 64-393 (latests as of today) and will not extract. Says it needs unl-acad.r00
,Stapel,2010-08-24T20:43Z,I have the same problem as Mosaic. Are we doing something wrong or is there a piece missing from the torrent?
,dandare00ukPirate,2010-08-25T01:20Z,"2nd copy I have download (in case 1st was corrupt) and it still doesn't un-archive. Not sure how others have got this to work but get the same issue as MosaicM. Even downloaded latest WinRar.
Wouldn't download this until it's fixed."
,kinjiromifune,2010-08-25T10:23Z,"I've managed to extract the files but when I tried to launch it it give me an error saying: the application failed to execute(0xc0000135)

any help would be appreciated."
,kinjiromifune,2010-08-25T11:15Z,"YAY! i've installed, turns out it needs dotNet framework....

but now here's another problem, it crashes after launching the app.

help anyone?"
,kinjiromifune,2010-08-26T06:33Z,"Finally got it to work, it needs the fully updated dotNet 3.5 for the game to run.

Thanks for the upload!!!!"
,Myrk,2010-09-06T02:10Z,"yeah, its missing a volume of the rar, can you upload that?"
,Myrk,2010-09-06T04:33Z,"so maybe its not missing a volume, but something fucked up when this was packed, even manually renaming every zip to .r00 to .r32 produces CRC errors for each archive. "
,eviction,2010-09-08T03:51Z,"/facepalm

You need to extract every zip file to the same directory. For some reason Stun archived each piece of the rar archive in a separate zip archive.

Thanks for uploading it and all, but seriously, what were you thinking?"
,soak314,2010-09-08T18:42Z,"Not exactly sure, but I think he put each part of the partitioned rar file into another, separate partitioned rar file. If that makes any sense.

Just extract each one individually (select all, extract here). Then extract the first file in the new ""unl-acd"" set of rars. Hope that makes sense.

,jimmann2,2010-09-24T06:50Z,"So this works, but it was literally the most confusing way to do anything ever. Whoever packed this torrent has absolutely no idea how compression works. You have to unpack it three times before you are at the conent you need to play."
,lani9,2010-10-27T07:12Z,"Alright... so I read over all the comments, still can't figure it out. I'd really appreciate it if someone could explain how I install this? "
