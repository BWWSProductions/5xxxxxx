,tpb_Monk,2010-08-19T06:15Z,"Thingy, couple of questions:
Which button(s) in the activator do you push to do the automatic run?
When I used the ""Activate Office 2010 and Install the KMS Activator"" button, I got a message recommending I make a task schedule to re run the activator. Is this the automatic run you are talking about?
If it is, wont that just prompt me to run the activator again and again and again ever 180 days?
Thanks ;]"

,kittyboat,2010-08-19T08:47Z,"kmsact.exe originally created in c:\documents and ttings\username\local settings\temp when you run ""Office 2010 Activation and Conversion Kit 1.6.exe"", it puts a copy of itself in c:\windows\ and TRIES TO CONNECT TO THE INTERNET, I guess the repeated ""false positives"" of TROJAN are actually correct... If anyone knows how to decipher Wireshark or other packet sniffer might help determine if this is really totally guilty as it is probably best to stay clear..."
[V],thethingy,2010-08-19T09:09Z,"kittyboat, well its a kms server and that IS WHAT IT DOES, it dont connect to the internet though but it does add a virtual server to your pc to keep you activated as thats what kms is, if you are not happy then dont use it, the virus total link is in the description so use your own judgement, I use this and it does not connect to the internet although it does copy itself as thats what it is supposed to do, try to learn about things before posting comments. Try to learn about how your firewall works also then you wont need to decipher packets as your firewall will ask you to allow an application or not and this just does not try to connect to the internet dipshit."

Just FYI to everyone, I did get that windows firewall prompt when I ran the activator, I understand how the KMS system works so I permitted. I figured it was just looping back and connecting to the local KMS server daemon.
Thingy I didnt see any services running. Any idea what its call so I can see it in Task Manager on my Win7 box?"
[V],thethingy,2010-08-19T10:09Z,"tpb_Monk, its called KMSservice in the services window of task manager, I use comodo firewall and set it to ask for each and every internet access inbound and out and got no requests for this, ""I figured it was just looping back and connecting to the local KMS server daemon"" think you may be right there"

[V],thethingy,2010-08-21T04:59Z,"newbie111, the activator is for all office, what you need to do is use the activator to change your edition to volume, the first button, then once changed use the second button to activate"

@ mrlegit: I got that message too. Just kept trying different buttons and finally got it to work. Cant remember which buttons I tried--all of them I think.
Just my recommendation, even if you have Win x64, you should still use Office x32 for features and compatibility purposes."

Mount the ISO onto a virtual drive, such as DAEMON tools, or whatever blows your hair back and the MSO2010 

should autorun.  Allow it to completely install and close the application when complete.

Next open the Office 2010 Activator and ensure that you run as administrator if you dont already have UAC turned 

off.  Click on option 1) ""Convert Retail Office to Volume License (Add Lic)"" and Select ""Professional Plus"" 

option top/right.  Then a prompt asks if you want to continue, select ""YES""  Then  allow the CMDs to do their 

thing.  Once done you will be offered to also remove the retail key.  Select ""CANCEL"".  Then close that CMD 

prompt window.

Then click the ""BACK"" button on the Activator (Top/Right).  Then click option 2) ""Activate Office 2010 and 

Install KMS Activator"" and allow the CMD window to process the commands.  It will expand from 1 window into 2

REMAINING GRACE: 180 days  (259200 minute(s) before expiring)

,Theblackswordsman,2011-01-21T23:01Z,"Works like a charm, thank u thethingy"
,dangeraus,2011-01-25T11:18Z,"this was the right advice to follow on windows 7 64 bit for me. i tried in vain a few times even clicking ignore on AVG when the false positives came up but it still wouldnt work. had to disable the resident shield.

Worked like a charm. Simple steps.

1. Disable AVG Resident Shield.
2. Run Activator As Administrator.
3. Install and Activate KMS Activator.

And have to do it again every six months. 

MUCHOS THANKO TO thethingy FOR THE UPLOAD AND MAN LIKE RuLeXDM FOR THE ADVICE"
,sinand99,2011-01-28T20:28Z,"I activated Office 2010 VL using thingy serial ""828CH-G4FPY-HMH4R-32GCK-6D9BH"" and later i installed Visio and Project. But they were not activated, so i used this tool to fix it but instead of activating visio and project pro, it fucked up my Office Plus licence. I tried many times but it didnt work. Then I found EZ-Activator 2.0 which works better:

If you dont want headaches, use EZ-Activator and avoid this tool."
,SaltSlasher,2011-02-07T23:55Z,"Dude this f#$^ing thing, just fu&$ed my whole computer up! 
I clicked it open and it asked what I want to open it with, and it recommended adobe reader, because I assumed it was instructions.

Well it just told every last file to open with adobe, and so every thing has the adobe A on it, and when I go to open anything, it trys opening it with adobe reader!

I can't believe this sh#t, I would of never expected this from thething. "
,Dorficer,2011-02-16T06:43Z,"@SaltSlasher

Don't blame thethingy or his torrent because you don't know how to use Windows, did something incredibly stupid and now don't know how to fix it."
,ld357,2011-02-19T14:53Z,"Ok, I read all the comments and took all the steps. I have tried all the activation methods and numbers but nothing succeeds in activating the product.

The only thing that works is the ""ReArm"" function of this crack, and I get 30 more days, but it says it's only good for 4 uses, and I still get the activation dialog every time I run one of the products in the Office 2010 suite.

The ""One Run"" office activator tried twice and eventually reported success, but it did not succeed.

This product, now that I have become dependent on it, will eventually stop working.

Any ideas?"
,twoonbay,2011-02-22T12:46Z,"As usual your work is well presented.  No problems with installing (Win 7 32 bit). @sinand99 provided a link for Easy Activator 2 and it too was without fault.  Those complaining need to think about their hardware as this is a 2010 release and needs more than the minimum the system requirements to be fully utilized.

Make sure you do study the readme.txt files or you will most likely cause yourself problems every time."
,spidergoo,2011-02-24T19:49Z,"Excellent! Works perfect 32bit windows 7
Thanks again for another great torrent the thingy!

,grizzmo,2011-03-01T11:17Z,"I just fully activated my office 2010 professional plus.
Here is how:

I entered the serial from sinand99's post:
828CH-G4FPY-HMH4R-32GCK-6D9BH

Installed and tried to activate over the internet which failed, so I tried the activate through phone option and called microsoft.
Before entering the ID from the screen, first choose you are a home user and you are installing on 1 PC only.
Then they generated my confirmation ID which I wrote down, so when ever something crashed I don't have to call again. Restarted Office and now my product is fully activated."
,grizzmo,2011-03-01T11:35Z,"Just activated my office 2010 professianl plus fully and here is how I did it.
Install this version and enter the serial from sinand99's comment: 828CH-G4FPY-HMH4R-32GCK-6D9BH 
Now I tried to activate over the internet which failed, so I tried to activate through the phone option. Here is how.
1. Call your local microsoft and give the following answers: you are a home user and you only use your copy one 1 PC. This will be accepted and you can enter the installation ID.

They asked me a few extra questions, so listen carefully, because otherwise you can't continue the process

Then they will generate a confirmation ID which you enter, which I did. So, i restarted my PC and my office is fully activated, no trial or test period anymore.

Maybe a hint: When you have the confirmation ID write it down, so when something craches you don't have to call them again.

Hope this works for someone else too."
,grizzmo,2011-03-01T11:48Z,"check the last numers off the key, so you can see I activated with the key from sinand99.

,Salriah,2011-03-02T03:58Z,"Thank you very much indeed [thethingy], your hard work is very much appreciated. Activation is working just fine, can not see the 180 days though. Where can I see the number of days? BTW, I chose to create a KMS monthly schedule but I have no idea where this KMS was saved. Any ideas on where to find it? In case you provided a permenant key, then I want to uninstall it as you suggested. I am using Windows 7 Home Premium."

I am Norwegian, so I found a Norwegian version of Office Proffesional Plus (this one; http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5899368/Microsoft_Office_2010_Norwegian_32_amp_64_bits_Version_with_key.) I downloaded you iorrt activator thing, and now i have a everlasting trial version. Every time i open an Office programme, i get a pop-up asking me to activate the product via internet or by phone. Is there any way to remove that message? It's kind of annoying.. Will this activator do the trick?

Please reply.

,Horror17,2011-09-22T14:58Z,"Works absolutely perfectly, took literally 10 seconds to activate and set up the process to keep it updated.

If Norton 360 is driving you mad, just turn off the auto-protect for 15 minutes (that's just what Norton gives you), then download this again. It will be up and running in less than a minute then Norton switches itself back on and you're ready to rock and roll

Thanks! x"

,viralintruder,2011-12-05T23:00Z,"---------------------------------THIS IS THE REAL DEAL---------------------------------

Downloaded thethingy's office 2010 torrent. It expired. Entered non-working codes until it rejected any more attempts.

1) Download this activator.
2) ReArm Office 2010 Products (says it can only be done four times, so click it once. DO NOT SELECT IF THIS IS A FRESH INSTALLATION, ONLY IF OFFICE HAS FAILED TO ACTIVATE BEFORE).
3) Convert Retail Office to Volume License and select your Office installation type (I had professional plus).
4) Check Activation Status... It should be 30 days remaining.
5) Activate Office 2010 and Install KMS Activator.
6) Check Activation Status... It should be 180 days remaining.
7) Allow it to install the task scheduling process.

If you are prompted to allow internet access or administrator privileges at any time, do so. This is a clean torrent from a trusted source. 

You should now have an activated Office 2010 suite. Do not update it or perform some other act of stupidity. Have a productive future (yeah right...)."
