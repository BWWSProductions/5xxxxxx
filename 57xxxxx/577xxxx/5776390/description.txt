          Release notes:
       
          FileMaker Pro is powerful enough to handle most database
          jobs yet easy enough to create simple solutions in minutes.
          This practical "how to" course by FileMaker expert John
          Mark Osborne, starts from beginner level and uses a single
          invoicing example to demonstrate all the features in
          FileMaker Pro 7, 8, 8.5, 9, 10 and 11 including field
          creation, finding, sorting, layout mode, container fields,
          auto-entry, validation, printing, scripts, calculations,
          importing, exporting, interface design and new FileMaker
          Pro 11 features including charting, snapshot links and the
          inspector. Examples of the invoice file are provided at
          every stage of the creation process so the user can easily
          review one section without starting from the beginning.
