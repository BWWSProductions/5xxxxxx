IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:Russian DVDR........ Thanks 
AUDIO:Rx ............ Thanks

Ok bit late bring this to the table, but better late then never i guess :P
Well used the russian video like everyone else ... source files were nice but looked too dark and dull looking and lacked some colour.
Audio was nice we prefered it to laps so ...
Video we did our normal stuff and wrote a script using crop, resize, white balance, brightness, contrast, rgb colours and sharpness.
Then it was just a case of muxing Rx's audio over the video ... no syncing was needed as Rx had already did all this, so thanks guys :)

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
