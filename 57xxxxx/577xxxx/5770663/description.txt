Lost Colony of Roanoke

In 1587, over 100 settlers landed in the New World to establish England's first permanent colony. Three years later, they had vanished. Investigating America's oldest missing-persons case, Josh Bernstein flies high above Roanoke Island in a powered para-glider; climbs and cores a cypress tree to study the climate conditions the settlers faced; participates in an American-Indian powwow; and learns to cook as the local 16th-century natives once did. Finally, Josh travels back to England to trace the roots of a family whose DNA suggests that at least one of the lost colonists may have survived.
