,FRANKFKA,2010-08-20T03:52Z, Hey raybob..thanks again for your work that you have put in this..I appreciate it!!  
,raybob4321877,2010-08-20T07:26Z,"Correction:

Sorry, this doesn't include the MD81, but it does include lots of MD83s.

My mistake."
,raybob4321877,2010-08-20T07:37Z,"OK, correction:

There are a few MD11's w/o a VC.  There are a few with a VC, and they are labeled 'MD11 VC'.  Also, there is one MD88 included with a custom 3D cockpit.  The MD83s are all FSX default models with freeware repaints, and use the FSX default VC from the 737."
,raybob4321877,2010-08-20T07:42Z,"Last correction I swear:

The MD88 apparently does NOT have VC although I do remember it being there . . .  Meh.

Also, the MD83 got its flight dynamics from the Captain Sim 757, so they're very realistic.

Enjoy!"
,raybob4321877,2010-08-20T08:08Z,"To everybody who downloads this:

As a thanks to me, don't download and run, but at least try to seed back what you took.  :)

Thanks."
