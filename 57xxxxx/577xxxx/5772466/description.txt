- As GOP and Some Top Dems Unite in Opposing N.Y. Islamic Community Center, a Roundtable Discussion With Mother of 9/11 Victim, Rabbi, Muslim Lawmaker and Islamic Scholar

We spend the hour on the controversy around the proposed construction of an Islamic community center in Lower Manhattan, which has turned into a national issue. Opposition to the center first started among fringe, right-wing blogs but has swept into the mainstream, with some Democrats including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid coming out against it. Republicans have vowed to make the controversy a campaign issue in the Fall. We host a roundtable with four guests: Minnesota Representative Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress; Rabbi Irwin Kula of the National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership; Islamic scholar John Esposito of Georgetown University; and Talat Hamdani, whose son Salman died on 9/11 in the attacks on the World Trade Center.
