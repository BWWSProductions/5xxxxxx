This band is the ultimate answer to those who are asking, what canterburian music deals with. Richard Sinclaire (Caravan), Pip Pyle (Delivery), Phil Miller (Matching Mole, Delivery) and Dave Stuart (Egg) established a supergroup that existed for only two albums.

It is not easy to describe in one sentence what the so-called Canterbury Music Scene stands for. To mention first are the musical similarities, secondly the geographical proximity of the involved musicians. Ideally both aspects are fitting, but this genre provides a big diversity of styles that can be best characterised as a blend of often catchy songs with jazz and classic influenced improvisations.

Key-bands for the Canterbury scene are: Soft Machine, Caravan, Egg, (early)Gong, Hatfield And The North, National Health, Henry Cow, Gilgamesh, only to name a few. They all emerged from the British, late sixties music culture and succeeded till the end of the seventies.
