,billybobaloo,2011-01-13T01:00Z,"I had the same problem as aryan6102.

The video pauses and seems frozen for almost a minute half-way through the movie.  Very unfortunate as otherwise is an incredible rip.

I tried it on VLC, Media Player Classic and XBox 360 after muxing in 2 channel audio.

Why have only 2 of us commented on this?  Is there a fixed version planned in the future?  Otherwise have to start looking elsewhere."
,vivatpb5776,2011-03-14T10:19Z,"I can confirm what aryan and billybob stated. I downloaded the movie and immediately went to the portion of the movie in question. It froze at the exact time point aryan mentioned.

As both of them indicated, the video quality is excellent. However, because of this flaw, I will look elsewhere for this movie."
