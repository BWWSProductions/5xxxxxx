,wira020,2010-08-19T12:22Z,something wrong with the video... a lot of artifacts that makes the pictures fills with blocks of colors... used mpc to play it... can somebody point me what i'm doing wrong?.. havent had any problem with mkvguy's rips before...
,muk0690,2010-08-19T19:24Z,"@wira020: Try closing all other programs and just run the mpc of vlc alone.....

Memory Usage too can bring up blocks in the video...."

@spottykid, yes let's wait for the DVDs and Blue-rays come out first, expect them in Oct..

@sreeja, two more days buddy..

@DSIN, you are welcome, m kinda busy, can't list a specific list..

@jobinpkd, yep, just got the BRRip for ""The Karate Kid"", for ""Who am I"", got the source, ripping is in progress, ""Prince of Persia"" is in R2 and R4 versions, waiting for the BRRip..

@ashbey1975, Thank you..

@muk0690, yep exactly - use VLC Player.."

[V],MKVGuy,2010-08-20T04:58Z,"@Marmaduke, 1 day.. or may be in few hours.."
,wira020,2010-08-20T14:39Z,"@muk Thanks for the tip, it played fine in WMP tho.. i guess i'm using the wrong codec with mpc or sumthing.. i hate vlc tho.. lol... the weird thing is, every other mkvguy's rip played fine with mpc... 

Thanks for this movie mkvguy, it looks great on WMP with ffdshow... the movie itself is very entertaining.. it got everything from comedy to drama... it's the kind of movie that i'd definitely keep for later viewing... I just hope people wont watch this with their family... some scenes are extra gross.. seriously only for matured audiences... Thanks again mkvguy!"
