,omegafox84,2010-08-24T04:27Z,"@ctang: checked it out again. there are two files that give the errors. VTS_04_4.VOB and VTS_04_5.VOB. the first gets hung up around 75% in and the second about 2% in. they're the very last two files. after you burn a copy, see if you're able to rip from it.

on a side note, if you don't have The Sandlot available at the moment i can up it. let me know."
,omegafox84,2010-08-24T22:32Z,just wondering if you tried ripping from the copy you made?
,ragtop69,2011-01-03T03:27Z,Hope this is the one I'm looking for. Thanks mate.
