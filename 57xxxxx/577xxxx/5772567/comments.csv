,remedyVenom,2010-08-19T12:57Z,"This was a sure remake candidate, the story is THAT good. 
However, if you can, watch the german original adaptation, because it feels much more authentic.
"
,stritte,2010-08-19T18:37Z,Of course must the Americans make a copy of the brilliant German move. Out of ideas again Hollywood?
,bigunit,2010-08-20T04:13Z,"give it a rest, stritte.  Hollywood puts out more quality movies in a month than your entire continent does in a year.  "
,remedyVenom,2010-08-20T05:12Z,"@bigunit:

and why is that? 

Give me a 200Mio. USD... and i`ll make you the best movie you`ve ever seen and will ever see....hell, i`ll do it for 40mio. and still put Hollywood to shame...     

it`s because, and dont take it personal, most americans are nationalists who wouldnt even bother with subtitles..... not to mention every foreign movie for some reason gets the worst american voice-actors/dubbers there are if dubbed for the US-market.

And a few years later...oops, Fox, Universal or Columbia makes a remake..ha! Coincidence?

And btw, just because you dont know there are tons of good movies out there, doesnt mean there arent any ;)      Blade Runner (UK) Das Boot (GER), The Fifth Element (France) and so on and so forth....    it`s all about the corporate sharks and the big pennies....   nothing to do with 'Hollywood is so creative...' ;)

cheers"

As someone else stated it does go black and white every so often, but it's not really a big deal. Almost seems to be part of the show.

The movie was fantastic. I almost want to see the original to see how different it was. Definite A+ on this one."

this movie is bad on so many levels. so many story/plot holes so much bad acting from great actors so much political innuendo... i am very disappointed as i usually love Forest Whitaker but this was just sad and painful to watch."
,Mattytha01,2011-02-12T11:32Z,"@remedyVenom haha. Your kidding right? subtitles suck so bad, and so do dubbed movies it borders unberible. The reason why these 'american' companies have so much money to spend on movies is because they make shit loads of money on movies because there sweet plain and simple. They have A list actors, amazing special effects and so on and so forth... Its honestly amazing the things you will see and read on the internet and what people believe.  "
,Asphalt-Man,2011-02-22T10:17Z,"noklus, NO ONE CARES WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS MOVIE!!!!!!! Just keep your opinions to yourself. Why go on all the different torrents for this movie and complain. SHUT UP! I'd understand if you paid for it but its F@#king FREE. Your Just as bad if not worse than the idiots that place a comment to seed. Like thats gonna make anyone actually go into their files and put it back in their DL/UP list just cause someone thinks its not downloading fast enough. Get real! 99% of people upload and the SECOND its finished they remove it. Bottom line this SH!t is free any we ALL should be thankful someone took the time and risk of uploading for our enjoyment. 

THanks to the uploade

,Totbot3000,2011-04-04T05:54Z,It may be a remake but its based on a true story. Google Stanford prison experiment
