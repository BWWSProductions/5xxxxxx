I still haven't watched, but I don't think this cropping will affect something.

On the good side, the quality is superior compared to all the other releases I downloaded."

ALLWAYS go for 1400Mb releases (2 CDs), higher bitrates 1100-1500

700Mb allways have 600-800 bitrates and picture is blocky and crapy. Not worth downloading unless there is no other options.
