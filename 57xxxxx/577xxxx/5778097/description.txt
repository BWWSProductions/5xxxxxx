Notes:
The low level on the album is ment to get listeners to max their volume and let
the thunder in the end of "Skoghens Minnen V?kks" crack their speakers. "Et
Sorghetog" was originally recorded with low pitched vocals. Photographies taken
by Fredrik Backar, under Shamaatae?s direction. Logos, pencil drawings and hand
writings by Shamaatae. The wooden staff is hand made by Shamaatae, it took him
two weeks with a soldering iron to burn all the sigills, texts and pictures
into the staff (only (dumb) perfectionists does these kind of things!!). During
the time this album was recorded, LP III "Kampen" and LP IV "Faunaz Samgang"
were completed. "O?egar?r" and "O?er Trulhoyghda" are the parts two (Del II)
and three (Del III) in the manifesto of the secret village of Tribalerna.
