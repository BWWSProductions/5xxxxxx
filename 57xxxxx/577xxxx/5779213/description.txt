When a brutal car accident takes place in the desolate backcountry, the only onlooker is Clive, a lonely man who lives nearby in an isolated shack. As he approaches the scene, he sees the girl of his dreams, dead among the debris. Certain that she is "the one,â€ Clive will do whatever it takes to keep her by his side. When the victimÃ¢Â€â„¢s sister and boyfriend arrive, they quickly become unwitting hostages.
