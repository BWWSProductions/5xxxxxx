How To Train Your Dragon 2-D HDTV 720p RiP READNFO XViD - IMAGiNE

NOTES :

Now got to be totally honest with you and say we are unsure WHAT this actually is....video wise.The detail on it
looks like a screener,but then now and again you see a border on the left side appear and then disappear and also
on the end credits you can see a pulse on the yellow background.....which neither of then some be one a screener but are
more often or not found on cams.....
Anyway we've tagged it how the source we used was which was a 5.20gig 720p mp4 file so.....
