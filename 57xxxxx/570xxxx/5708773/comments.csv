,Gspx599,2010-07-23T13:28Z,why make rar. it hardly reduces any size. and deprives me of a chance of checking out first few pics before i download the lot.

When you can match Marcco for uploads, then you can criticize him.
Me? if Marcco uploads with LhArc I'll still download the torrents becuase I'll know it's quality and worth having."
