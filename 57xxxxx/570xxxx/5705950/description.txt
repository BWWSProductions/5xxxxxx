J L Bourne - Beyond Exile (Day by Day Armageddon, book 2)


"J. L. Bourne is the new king of hardcore zombie action!" - Brad Thor



START INTERCEPT
Armies of undead have risen up across the U.S. and around the globe; there is no safe haven from the diseased corpses hungering to feed off human flesh. But in the heat of a Texas wasteland, a small band of survivors attempt to counter the millions closing in around them.
INTERCEPT COMPLETE

Survivor,
Day by day, the handwritten journal entries of one man caught in a worldwide cataclysm capture the desperation - and the will to survive - as he joins forces with a handful of refugees to battle soulless enemies both human and inhuman from inside the abandoned Hotel 23.

But in the world of the undead, is mere survival enough
