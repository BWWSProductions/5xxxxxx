CAM version. So you know some of widescreen cut off and it's that acceptable level of blurry, due to lighting.

But, hey, I'm not complaining over a FREE movie that gives me the idea of what the movie was about. Thanks TvTeam."
,Zatenkai,2010-08-02T01:35Z,Downloading now i will report once i've completed the download.
,pacong_bakya,2010-08-06T12:27Z,"A-7
V-7
I recomend use Gom Player for clearer viewing."
,Loki_uk,2010-08-08T13:39Z,"Final: 
VLC : 6
GOM : 2
BS Pro Player : 3

If you donât care about streaming, the choice would really be between bs and vlc, but with vlc being better, and free, it should be a no brainer. I am honestly going to uninstall GOM and BS as soon as I finish this post."
,rokridge,2010-08-08T21:26Z,"here here! VLC is king. The full list of options is overkill & itâll play almost any file type. I would also recommend WINAMP if you want quality visualisations to accompany listening to music.

,jahberry,2010-08-15T14:00Z,"i swear by winamp :) awesome stuff.

be sure you use 'Mikdrop 2' for your visuals tho. beautiful. 

VLC all the way baby!"
,kenjamen,2010-08-17T06:23Z,Totally.  As a computer technician I generally install winamp and vlc on everyone's computer.  Along with divx of course
,Lucky13s,2010-08-23T09:05Z,"DivX, Winamp, Winrar, VLC, all musts on someones computer. He'll you should grab spybot S&D if you need some good free anti virus.

Id slap people who dont even have winrar on their computers."
,jake1977,2010-08-26T00:12Z,thanks man!
,fuSIoN187,2010-08-26T02:24Z,"Ive tried every media player suggested, the last 45 minutes of the movie is almost completely unviewable. 
A 8
V 5

Cant complain for it being free though. Thanks for trying. My suggestion, turn off the auto focus. Good try anyhow. 

Thanks."
,ransomboy,2010-08-27T11:30Z,"Spybot S&D (the S&D is important if you're googling it) is an anti-spyware programme, not anti-virus. It's damned god at what it dos though so I'd agree, get it. Can't recommend a free A/V though as I get a paid for version for free through work"
