Complete season one of Archer, the animated tv show on FX.  Specifically kept in HD and resized for Motorolla Droid users.  Don't fret, works on the iPhone, just the aspect ratio is a little skew.  Also runs fine on the computer and MP4 is a typical format that WMP reads so you won't have to do go run around for codecs, but if you do I CCCP and Kazaa Lite Codec Pack (Standard) work just fine.  Who doesn't have codecs after all?

Show Info:
At ISIS, an international spy agency, global crises are merely opportunities for its highly trained employees to confuse, undermine, betray and royally screw each other. At the center of it all is suave master spy Sterling Archer, whose less-than-masculine code name is "Duchess." Archer works with his domineering mother Malory, who also is his boss. He also has to deal with his ex-girlfriend, Agent Lana Kane and her new boyfriend, ISIS comptroller Cyril Figgis, as well as Malory's lovesick secretary, Cheryl.



Thanks to Lil'Dick, Dimension, and eztv, for their 720p releases, even though none of them release the high def version of Training Day.  I have no idea where the hell I found that.
