,FearCain,2010-07-19T00:53Z,"I am seeding on two computers, so go ahead and feel free to start downloading.  I verified it is working."
,FearCain,2010-07-19T05:31Z,"If those downloading now are interested in any other Droid releases let me know.

Secondly, anybody know if there is anything else out there like Archer or something I would like?  I know about Sealab 2021 and Frisky Dingo, all three were made by Adam Reed."
,FearCain,2010-07-31T22:38Z,"I am going to ask for those downloading to help me seed, officially hit 50.000 share ratio yet I only have 1 other person seeding.  Availability is just over 2.4.  I just need one or two more seeders, I am currently uploading it to 13 more people.  Please seed with me."
