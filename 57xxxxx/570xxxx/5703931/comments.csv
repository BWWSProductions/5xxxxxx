There were exactly three parts in the entire episode where things got a bit fuzzy for about a second and a half, but none were during important parts and the rest of the episode was fine. It's a good quality episode with good subs. Great torrent, thanks for uploading."

,JackRipped,2011-01-29T00:46Z,BTW I didn't mention  it but these are excellent quality really superb.
