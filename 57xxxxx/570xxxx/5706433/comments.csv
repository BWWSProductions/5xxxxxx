,sbale,2010-10-24T07:58Z,"It appears raymondhome has upoaded this torrent in several formats. In the one which is 733 mb the uploader comment: ""QUALITY IS BETTER THAN PREVIOUS RELEASES"" which i presume are this one (984 mb) a 1.4 Gb and another 973 mb torrent. So i suggest to download and seed the 733 mb torrent "
