On September 21, 2000, bassist Mark Helias and Open Loose took the stage at
Manhattan's New School University as part of an annual concert series produced
by the Jazz Composers Collective. Happily, the tape was rolling and this superb
CD is the result. The aptly named trio features tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby
and drummer Tom Rainey. Helias pilots the group with a selfless spirit; his
compositions walk a fine line between structure and freedom and any of the three
instruments can take the lead or recede into the background at any
time. Lurching unpredictably between stirring cacophony and wily precision, Open
Loose rewrites the rules of jazz trio interaction even as they summon a sound
rooted in jazz tradition. Highlights include the driving quasi-funk of "Mapa,"
the unison themes and frequent tempo shifts of "Startle" and "Pick and Roll,"
and the moody ballad "Gentle Ben."
