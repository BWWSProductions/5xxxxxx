A RIP of the Aerosoft Mega Airport Amsterdam X v1.0

It is the 2010 FSX only Release. No installer and therefore no options. Don't like it? - I don't care.

Installation:

1.Unpack
2.copy files to the correct FSX folder using common sense
3.Add scenery manually to your scenery library using common sense

Don't know how to do that? - I don't care.

Not my own release, not tested either but found.
