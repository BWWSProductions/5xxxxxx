Unpacked this packet is supposed to be 285MB.

TBP search sucks when I uploaded it the search did not find the release by 32bit.
Probably and supposed to be because I never tested it.
I only posted it because that shithead that knew that there is already a release requested it again and I stumbled over it a few minutes earlier."
,kwensi,2010-07-19T00:33Z,"Hi 1sh1g4mi,

Thanks for the upload, I just want to let you know that your upload is actually the real fsx version of Asmterdam. The one be 32Bit is does not work. Thanks again.

Anymore good scenery will be appreciated."

I installed the version from 32Bit and it works perfectly well (W7 64). One has to add the scenery manually into the scenery.cfg and thats it."

,irikimoss,2010-10-01T03:13Z,"Is it just me, or this airport is not the real deal? 

The textures' buildings are very very low in quality, and I can NOT see any bridges on the gates. 

Can you please post your impression on this? Thanks in advance."
,vliegtuigmonteur,2011-06-25T14:48Z,"I dont think this scenery makes any sence, or i am a noob :P if i install/place the maps on the right directory, FSx load this scenery but if i enter the world to the airport, i will see a lot of trees across the taxi and runways, anyone can explain why? too bad, it's a nice addon pack.. anyways, check this screeny: http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/692/treesw.jpg/"
