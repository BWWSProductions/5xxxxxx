Although one issue remains. The campaigns still do not work! If you try to restart a campaign or continue, an error message pops up. Any ideas? "

I thinik it's worth it to make them keep up the good work (it's not as good as Falcon 4 though) but flightsimulators arnt released every day, nowadays.. "
,Skyrat70,2010-07-19T16:36Z,"taloncg, I had same issue with different torrent. Just go to your install directory... \LockOn Flaming Cliffs 2\Missions\Campaigns\LOP and change \en to \ru. That worked for me. Good luck!  BTW - Is this torrent all in EN like the non-working Skidrow one?  I currently have a mix-match between Skidrow and Artist combo."
,taloncg,2010-07-20T02:25Z,"Renaming the folder worked perfectly. Thanks Skyrat!

@piglet666. I agree with you to an extent, however... I only try before I buy now. Wasted too much money over the years on crap games. IF I like it and it's a quality program I will buy it."
,HushemFlupskluk,2010-07-24T18:22Z,"I Don't get it working on vista x64 ultimate.
The crackfix didn't solve the problem.

Can I get a folder for x64?"
