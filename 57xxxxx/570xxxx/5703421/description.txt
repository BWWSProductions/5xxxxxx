This was apparently a television broadcast concert in Bulgaria.
I got this copy from a friend in Sophia!
The quality of the audio and video is not awful and not great.
My gripe with this is the narration over the music in the beginning
(which is in Bulgarian!).
Plus the video freezes for a second or two between songs.
I'm assuming this originated as a VHS recording
and was duped to DVD. There is no authoring here.
(Been Busy Lately) I'm just sharing what I have.
Nonetheless, it's a must have for Planet X fans.

I welcomed all you demonoids / pirates who perhaps can
remastered, redit and perhaps add subtitle over the narration.
