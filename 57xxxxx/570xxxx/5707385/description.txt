Alex talks with writer, director, and producer Brian Kraft and Robert DiNozzi about Kraft's The Fall of America and The Western World, an 8+ hour documentary. The video explores the current economic crisis, the Federal Reserve, the emerging police state, the globalist agenda, and how political agendas in media have destroyed our ability to get real news. Robert DiNozzi was the executive producer of Flightplan, a 2005 feature film starring Jodie Foster.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
