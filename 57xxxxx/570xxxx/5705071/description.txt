    PROPER REASON: SRP got lazy with their audio and took the easy way out 
    and just muxed in the DVB-Audio, and a DVB intro mixed into CDDA with 
    no sound effects. We also had the same trouble with our source audio  
    being sub-standard as the dynamic range was obviously very different, 
    if you replicated, reversed channels, compressed and eq balance it    
    was somewhat nicer, but still not nice enough... at least not for     
    FRAY. What we opted to do was search/find a nice audio source from a  
    web music video which had similar dynamic range to that of our        
    replacement CDDA and also at 44.1khz, and we found it. So we used     
    this in conjunction with OMA's nice CDDA release and tah-dah... a     
    very nice ending result that is CDDA quality and contains all sfx.    
    Seeing Ozzy Osbourne is a long standing music artist, we only thought 
    that this video deserves our respect, and to do it right the first    
    time, with great video and great audio. p.s we even included a        
    screenshot of our audio, just incase you dont believe us :D           
    
    REASON = bad.audio.replacement_get.FRAY.proper
    
    fuck you SRP, and for all the rest... enjoy :)
