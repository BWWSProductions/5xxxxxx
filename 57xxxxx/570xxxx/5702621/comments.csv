first off, thx!
I was looking for some feedback on my install plan, mainly will it work:
-Acrobat Pro, Pro updates
-CS5 Design Premium
-CS5 32bit support package 
- and this Elearning Suite 2.
If I install all of this, following the instructions to the letter, should I be ok? thx for fielding my questions, my ""measure twice, cut once"" approach can be annoying at times. :) thx again for all you do!"

,segankure,2010-11-10T10:57Z,serial number?
,hamu786,2010-12-30T07:19Z,"thethingy, I have installed elearning suite 2 and followed the instructions but whenever i captivate 5, it tells me that the serial number is not correct..please help.Thankx"
,hamu786,2010-12-30T07:21Z,"thethingy, thx for the suite.  I do have a question about install. it keeps on telling me that serial is not valid.....any suggestions. thanks"
[V],thethingy,2010-12-30T19:33Z,"hamu786, your hosts file wont be set, there is a video in this;

that shows you how to set it, you can copy the dll files also to fix that issue."
,TOMWALK,2011-01-23T05:46Z,"I second oyvind67's question:

Will Adobe Updater work with this? I already have a paid version of Acrobat Pro on my system, and I need to be sure I can still update that if I install this.

Also, will this eLearning Suite, as it is, work with Powerpoint 2010?"
,TOMWALK,2011-01-23T09:00Z,"Ok. Installed ok. It says it's an invalid serial number, so it could not start a Creative Suite Live subscription, but the software seems to work.

ONE BIG QUESTION:  It looks like there's a separate installation that has to be done for Adobe Presenter. It asks for a serial, and the ones given in the instructions don't work. Can you help?"
,donaldo11,2011-02-10T23:30Z,"hi, spend hours downloading it to find there was no Part 1.rar. Also when i compressed the other parts there was problems with deamweaver, soundbooth, and one other app.

In miro one part shows up with no file size and says contents are part 4 and 5. (part 2 to 7 show up ok)"

students, beginners and all ""stand alone designers of fortune"" have chance to learn, test, work and feel like ( usually overpaided ) corporated-agency employes.

Every one, every enterprise can have web page and quite nice advertisment.

With available efective, profesional tools small group, one-man-business can make competiotion with rich-big full suported companies.

Proper prices shouldnt ""pay"" for ""big financial games"" the richest.

Did Adobe feel not enought big design-software-developer? By buying Macromedia they made small monopoly. such a situations never were good for customers."

I for one really appriciate having the oppurtunity to use products and gain experiance without having limitations on ""trial"" software.  Now, any chance on getting ELEARNING SUITE 2.5 or captivate 5.5??   Thank you again.  "
,pyvonner,2011-07-12T23:05Z,"thethingy,

Your uploads have truly helped me during my undergrad courses. I don't know how to even thank you for all your resourceful uploads pertaining to Adobe's Creative Suite. 

I really don't know how I could ever thank you for taking the time out and doing this for others. Seriously, I needed these programs to complete my school work and even with the discount Adobe gives for students, I couldn't afford the cost. Thanks to you, and the programs and learning modules you've uploaded, I've completed my undergrad and now I'm in grad school, still using the Adobe CS4 suite I downloaded from you about a year ago. 

Thank you for all that you do and if there is anything I could do for you... I certainly would. 

Thank you once again...
