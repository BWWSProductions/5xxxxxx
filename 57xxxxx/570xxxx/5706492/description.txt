Species is a 1995 American science fiction horror  film directed by Roger Donaldson, and starring Ben Kingsley, Forest Whitaker, Natasha Henstridge, Michael Madsen, Alfred Molina and Marg Helgenberger. It was given an R  rating for "sci-fi violence, strong sexuality, and some language".

This film produced one theatrical sequel in 1998, Species II, which had Henstridge, Madsen, and Helgenberger reprise their roles. It was followed by the direct-to-video Species III in 2004 and Species: The Awakening in 2007, which stands as a separate film, not as an official follow-up to the previous three.

The film is about a group of scientists who try to track down and trap a killer alien seductress before she successfully mates with a human male.
