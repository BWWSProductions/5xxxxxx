Opie and Anthony 2010-07-19-O&A-CF64K-Incomplete
Sirius XM Satellite Radio Show
English, MP3
Spread the Virus!!

As the title states, this is not a complete copy. The boys went extra long today and through various circumstances there is not yet a full copy of today's show. If one surfaces, I will post it...eventually.


The kid comes through again!

Patched together from an external source, because I failed today. Missing the final couple minutes because they went over.

Stats:
Opie at Yankee Stadium, The disgusting summer heat, Other weekend stuff, Patrice O'Neal in-studio, The death penalty, Conspiracies!, More sports talk, Old timey racist ads, More Mel Gibson remixes? Movie talk, Randy Couture & Terry Crews in-studio

Original Upload by Inflammo. Thank you Inflammo for making my job easier, and getting out these early Up's!!



Anyone seen Goosey?"

Besides inflamo, I think you are the only           opie & anthony fan uploading. Much thanks by the way. Mother goose has not uploaded in like a month."
,KungFuKane,2010-07-19T23:57Z,"I guess goose has flown the coop.

[T],shuazien,2010-07-20T02:25Z,"The bay here won't let me upload the complete file, so go check out one of the alternatives. Kick ass torrents or demonoid."
[T],shuazien,2010-07-20T04:18Z,"Hey everybody! Heads up! I am going to stop using The Pirate Bay this weekend. This coming Friday July 23rd will be the last day I post OnA on the pirate bay. I'm not going to discuss this with anyone sooo.... Don't ask.

I'll post links to the other sites that I will continue posting on."
,tobu24,2010-07-20T04:48Z,thanks for the heads up shu
,makaveli89,2010-07-20T17:08Z,"hey, what time do you usually upload O and A at m8? "
[T],shuazien,2010-07-20T17:42Z,"Hey tobu, I might have spoken too soon. I only seem to have about a third of January '09.  I recall having a hard drive crash a while back, now I see what I have lost.  I am busy looking for another source for the rest of the month, but it isn't looking too good. Also, the day in question, I don't have.  So, I'll continue trying to get a hold of it, but I don't think I will get it by this weekend. Sorry 'bout that.

Makaveli, I usually have the show up by 9AM PST. That is a good time to start checking."
,makaveli89,2010-07-20T17:44Z,"no prob, thanks your doing a great job.appreciate it."
[T],shuazien,2010-07-20T18:23Z,"So, now I can't upload anything to the bay.
Nor can I post a link here.
Go to kickasstorrents, or demonoid."
,Thomas1002732,2010-07-20T20:36Z,"Just added all shows from Jan 2009.  Get them here:

,Thomas1002732,2010-07-20T20:37Z,"Oh, and thanks to Shuazian, Mothergoose and all the others who make it possible to listen to the show when we aren't near an XM."
,Thomas1002732,2010-07-20T20:39Z,"One last thing, any other shows needed from when the boys were suspended after the Homeless Charlie bit I have, so feel free to ask, plus I have a bunch of older WNEW things on file I uploaded once before but I am not sure that torrent still exists.  "
,go_yukuri,2010-07-21T00:41Z,No worries.  Cheers for the ups and look forward to the new site.
,tobu24,2010-07-21T02:51Z,"Thanks Thomas and Shu, your efforts make life tolerable =]"
