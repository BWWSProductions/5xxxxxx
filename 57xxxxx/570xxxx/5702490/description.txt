This cd and "Matador" are two of Grant Green's best cd's. Both were recorded with Coltrane's rhythm section, and both are classics. "Matador" and "Solid" are to Grant Green as "Live at the Half Note" and "Full House" are to Wes Montgomery. Really inspired playing by all. ~ Ben Fernandez

"Solid" shows one of the greatest occasional sextets i've ever listened to. Grant Green in top form, Joe Henderson fabolous and versatile as usual, James Spauding with his great acid alto (too often underrated!), and a rithmic section that doesn't need superfluous words! George Russel's "Ezz-thetic" literally burns of an urgent fire(compare it with Roach's hard bop version in "Plus four"), as well as Henderson's "The kicker". Cook & Morton defined it marvellous, waiting for the CD edition. Really it is. ~ Christian Garaffa
