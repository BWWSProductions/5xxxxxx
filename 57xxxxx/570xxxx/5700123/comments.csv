m:6 or 7 well befor watching it i wasnt expect much. jus maybe a bunch of girl picking up guitars and and magically getting together and becomin famous, in away it was just that. sometimes it was to cheesey for my taste. sometimes theres good part, like the lesbains scences lol and dakota fanning is a full women now lol. and twilight girl is a bad actor,sayin fuck to much, it seemed lik if she was pushin it out but u see her tits in it so see the movie for that reason alone i guess. 

favortie line: ""ur nothing but a dirty pussy"" and ""im thinking with my cock""(fanning) idk y i felt lik i had to say it"

,lolimlal,2011-02-27T10:38Z,"i watched the movie its average 
but the band really isn't good.They didn't have great songs except some covers.But it was one of the first girl bands so respect that."
,kickedoff5,2011-03-10T06:26Z,"OMG I like Dakoda Fanning, but I love Joan Jett.  I had every album she made with the black hearts.  Prolly the first in my gang of boys.  I was 17 when I heard her fell in LOVE. 
I still love ya Jett.  Gonna replace the albums now.   Great movie for fans of the Blackhearts, wish I could give you more +'s at the top of this page.  Thank you"
,wraththefurious,2011-04-08T01:17Z,"frd420,

Acting is an art form, so the pleasure you take from it is subjective. I can't tell you that Kristen Stewart is a ""good"" actress, as if that could be a ""fact"", because it's not, it's just my opinion...but I really thought she did a great job in this movie. I really think you were a little harsh. She's playing a foul mouthed, degenerate rock star. She's supposed to say ""fuck"" a lot.

Anyone familiar with Joan Jett would concur, I believe. I think Stewart's one of the best talents out there, and I'm pretty hard to please. She really became the character, and if you see her during the release of the films you can see she's still playing the part, like it was hard to shake off. I admire that kind f passion and dedication.

But that's just my 2 cents. 

Thanks for the upload, FXG Team."
