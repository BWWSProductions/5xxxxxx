,rob4209,2010-07-19T07:33Z,"The first time I downloaded a torrent from eztv, it was a total phishing scam.  I was trying to get the 4th episode of true blood season 3, and then I found out the episode hadn't even aired yet.  So I was like FUCK EZTV!  But then I tried again and it was a little different, I think the first one was a fake.  Since then I've had no problems from EZTV...well, except for this torrent downloading slow as hell when my internet speed is like up to 15/mgb a second!  Mgb?  Is that right?  Megabytes, mb or mgb?"
,bear1986,2010-07-19T08:26Z,2600+ seeders and only a few comments?
,deadspaced,2010-07-19T08:28Z,Do not download. Contains a cyber police man who will pop out of your computer and arrest you for premeditated piracy of the internets in the first degree. 
,arildus,2010-07-19T08:29Z,Thanx;)
,SlayerX09,2010-07-19T08:29Z,"damn, still no subtitles for the episode...anyone has any idea where to find the subtitles more ore less when the shows come out?

Still, thanx Eztv, great job as ever."

..once i d/l movie torrents in .avi format what is the best/simplest way to convert and burn to a dvd playable by dvd players and any other video players such as xbox 360?"
,les907,2010-07-20T04:21Z,"Why do you complain if we don't comment? This isn't Clash of the Titans where EZTV loses god-like powers if we don't give thanks. Pirates don't fight for glory, we fight to rage against the machine, man."
