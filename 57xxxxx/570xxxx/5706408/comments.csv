,SamLT,2011-07-08T05:57Z,"Don't bother with this torrent.
Four season two episodes are missing.  The episodes are miss-numbered and out of order.  One episode is here twice.  Some episodes have a partial commercial or two left in.  At least one episode is truncated before the finale.

This one seems better: https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4841288/Airwolf.1984.Season.2.DVDRip"
