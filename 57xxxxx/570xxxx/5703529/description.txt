Kiss - The Making of DYNASTY (S.I.R. Studios - New York City - February 1979)


KISS jams with producer Vini Poncia in New York's S.I.R Studios in preparation for the Dynasty recordings. Witness the birth of song ideas while different takes are being recorded.

There's lots of talking and joking from Gene, Paul, Ace & Peter... very interesting stuff as you join them while developing songs step by step... The quality isn't perfect as it has some hiss but it's always worth hearing!
Please notice that these are rough recordings without any post production (6 CD's in all).
