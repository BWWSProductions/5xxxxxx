,andrelle,2010-07-19T17:20Z,"Lovin the downloads, keep up the good work."
,blahblahxz,2010-07-20T23:59Z,"Thanks again, you hero :)"
,thunderx7,2010-07-21T01:06Z,"PT, since the source is a 1.45 mkv file, why not make a 550MB x264 720p mp4 file? 1.3 GB is still too large. "
[V],poppedtart,2010-07-21T02:23Z,it just so happens that the source is encoded at very near what my normal encoding bitrate is.  My objective isn't to halve the size of things.
,jehoke39,2010-07-21T12:29Z,"Keep up the good work poppedtart, lovin the true bloods. Will you be doin the whole series as it airs?"
[V],poppedtart,2010-07-23T22:59Z,"probably, less i get really bored."
,jehoke39,2010-07-27T14:18Z,"I suppose I'll just have to pray that you don't get bored then :-)
poppedtart is the best!!!  (worth a try I suppose)"
,MCH78,2011-07-17T08:09Z,Thanks PT!  DL was slow but I think my network is being a punk but all worth it for the quality!
