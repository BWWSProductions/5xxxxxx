Srcds allows you to to serve an online game in a virtual environment. If you have a good connection and computer available, you can simply install the software and prepare your virtual battlefield to be entered. srcds will serve all Half-Life 2 ("Game of the year 2004") based games, including Counter-Strike Source, Day of Defeat Source and alot more modifications!

If you run your own Source Dedicated Server, you have control over most of the settings.
For instance, you have control over the amount of gravity, the current map and the mapcycle and alot more.
You also have full control over the players. When a player misbehaves, you can simply permanently or temporary remove the weak link and continue the game.

This is SRCDS ONLY, steam version.
