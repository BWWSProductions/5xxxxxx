Review	by Richie Unterberger
The dozen tracks on obscure Australian rocker Mike Furber's 1967 LP were, as was often the case for the time, culled from a variety of sources, including two 1966 singles that saw some Australian regional chart action, ""Just a Poor Boy"" and ""You Stole My Love."" It's fair British Invasion-styled rock, though it doesn't stop with just imitating overseas trends, as most of the songs are themselves covers of British and American tunes. Some of the British ones covered, in fact, are quite obscure: ""You Stole My Love"" was first done (and handled much better, to be honest) by Graham Gouldman's mid-'60s band the Mockingbirds, while ""Stop"" was an early Moody Blues original. Furber was an okay but uneven singer, and in fact sounds rather horribly off-pitch on ""Stop!"" He also seemed to favor fairly tough R&B material that was actually a little too tough for his ordinary range, rather in the way British singers like Neil Christian and Dave Berry recorded some hard R&B that was a little at odds with their mild, pop-oriented voices. The moody, tuneful Merseybeat-ish beat ballad ""You're Back Again"" and the similar (but harder rocking) ""Love Talk"" are the standouts, both because they're not overly familiar songs and because they're more suited toward Furber's voice than the soul-R&B stuff. [While it's good to have a CD reissue of this rare album available, as packaging goes, this makes even the skimpiest bootleg look good. Not only are there no liner notes or original release labels or dates; there are not even any song titles listed. (There are, however, two photos, each of them printed three times in various places on the cover and inner sleeve.)] 

Furber, born in London in 1948, emigrated along with his family to Australia in the '50s. A chance meeting in 1965 with two members of the fledgling garage band, The Bowery Boys, resulted in Furber joining the group as singer. At this point, the band was definitely a single entity, but when they were spotted by impresario Ivan Dayman and subsequently signed to his burgeoning Sunshine Records label, the emphasis shifted to Furber, who Dayman intended to launch as a solo act. Although Furber had a limited vocal range, Dayman saw his little boy lost teen-girl appeal and so the group became Mike Furber And The Bowery Boys. Just A Poor Boy (the band's first and only album), achieved modest chart success but brought theunwanted attention of the music press. Three more singles followed until, at Dayman's behest, Furber parted company with the highly-talented Bowery Boys to pursue a solo career, which, despite the patronage of Barry Gibb, failed to materialise. In October '67, Furber released wbat many believed to be his finest single, Bring Your Love Back Home, but the record-buying public failed to concur, and the single disappeared without trace, an occurrence which prompted the first of many nervous breakdowns. A single penned by the Easybeats' Harry Vanda followed, along with a few recordings for EMI-Columbia which were never released. And that was almost that. Furber's career stumbled along for a few more years, but following his sacking from the stage musical Nuclear, he lapsed into of this sorry little saga is that The Bowery Boys themselves were an extremely tight and accomplished band which, bad it not been overshadowed by Furber, would undoubtedly have gone on to greater things, as this superb album amplattes. Radio-Active. 2005.
