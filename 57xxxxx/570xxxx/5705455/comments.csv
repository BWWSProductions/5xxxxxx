,freakyman19,2010-07-28T17:32Z,"what should I do with the metafile?
my tomtom say: tomtom map can not be used.
help please."
,MrJinky,2010-07-28T19:46Z,"Works perfect with ""Easy Map Activation Tools"".
But...

TomTom 7.910 / 7.915 / 7.918 dossent ""see"" this map.
I cant choose it from the maplist.

Whats wrong?"
,Omswiender,2010-07-29T21:36Z,"1)	Install TomTom Navigator 7 with the TTN_7.450.9028.cab provided
2)	Copy the folders RASTER and VOICES to the root of the storage card
3)	Copy the folder of your map (e.g. Western_and_Central_Europe_V720_1803, not included in this package) to the root of the starage card
4)	Start TomTom and look up your DEVICE ID from TomTom, which can be found in the file ttnavigator.bif on the starage card under DeviceUniqueID
5)	Copy the file *.meta from your map folder and put it in the folder where you saved the downloaded files (I recommend C:\TTN7 for an easy use)
6)	Open a command prompt on your pc and navigate to this folder
7)	Execute the command 	
	tt7_keygen.exe ?path to the *.meta? ?XXXXX-XXXXX?
	where XXXXX-XXXXX will be your Device ID found before	
	Example:
	tt7_keygen.exe ?C:\TTN7? ?XXXXX-XXXXX?
	If everything succeeds, the patcher should return an ""OK"" message.
8)	Now copy the new file *.meta.dct from this folder to the folder of your map on the storage card
9)	Open TTN7
10)	Enjoy!!!!"
,Omswiender,2010-07-29T21:37Z,doesn't work on PDA TomTom Navigator_7.450.9028
,gvp2612,2010-07-30T11:05Z,Ik heb een TomTom One XL T Europe met TomTom Home software. Zal de werkwijze van Omswiender bij mij werken? Ik heb bvb geen TT Navigator.....
,MrJinky,2010-07-30T11:42Z,"gvp2612: Dont think so.
I believe that this is for PDA."
,gvp2612,2010-08-01T11:09Z,"@MrJinky : That's what I thought also, tnx!
Anyone know any torrent for One XL T => no PDA?
Tnx a million."
,andzejek,2010-08-01T13:37Z,it works fine on GO 720 with navcore 9.026 and corresponding SE tt system.
,Pulverman,2010-08-03T01:48Z,"Works perfect on my TomTom 730, with navcore 8.351."

,matz8916,2010-08-09T00:44Z,"@Omswiender your instructions cant be used with this torrent....

There is no ""TomTom Navigator 7 TTN_7.450.9028.cab provided""

There is no ""raster and voices folder""

all you get when you extract this is the ""western europe folder"" with a bunch of .dat files.

@Stun

There are no instructions, does this even work with a tomtom one, nobody fuckin knows. What a waste of time this torrent is..."
,Obelix:(,2010-08-09T21:33Z,"Used this one with Easy Activator.
Installing + patching works perfect (no errors)
But in the end my TT-One doesn't see the map.
i'll stop seeding this since it looks pointless.

-Scott me up Beamy-"
,bojanban123,2010-08-09T22:37Z,waist of time
,Obelix:(,2010-08-10T23:38Z,"better go with this one:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5628109/tomtom_europe_850.2801_meta_inside

But use this key instead:

; Europe_2GB_850_2801
9C 7C CD D8 7C 00 47 85 A7 44 2B 3A 7C 17 CF 7D Europe_2GB-162.meta

It works for my old tomtom one :)"
,glalufc,2010-08-15T22:48Z,Does anyone know if this will work on a Go710?
,nauriceprivat,2010-08-31T18:50Z,great torrent
,bitdevil,2010-08-31T22:20Z,"Works fine with my TomTom ONE !

To activate the map I used 'Albert's Easy Activator v0.57.21 ' :

Thanks Stun!"
,stimpy1984,2010-09-06T12:21Z,"I couldn't get this map to work. Activating the meta with the specified one returned ""OK"", but when starting TomTom Navigator 7.910, it informs me that no maps are installed.

This (older?) map worked without any problems:

,IchiTheKiller,2010-09-11T14:20Z,"This works on my Tomtom XL 2 IQ Routes Edition!
I used 'Albert's EasyActivator5' to make this work.
I accidently formatted my tomtom, but it works again! thanks to the uploader!"
,SomeOne02,2011-07-07T01:09Z,"If this one does not work for you on a Tom Tom One v3 this is because you are using an outdated version: NavCore 7903.

Install an navcore version 8.5 or higher (use google to find this version) on your SD card."
,zutmanuk,2011-07-15T20:11Z,"sorry new to this i have got the new map files but its in vdc format i have been trying for 4 days cant do anything with them have tryed to mount them tryed to burn to dvd with nero please help me with this it must be simple (bit like me)
