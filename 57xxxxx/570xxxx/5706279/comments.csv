,breeson,2010-07-21T18:40Z,"Thanks raymondhome!  I love your posts and your comments too!

Theaters where I live charge an extra $2 for 3D glasses, but you can keep the glasses after the film.  Or, say a person was inside a theater showing a 3D movie - they usually have large display boxes where many people place used glasses to be ""recycled."" "

,aikidy,2010-11-14T16:30Z,Scrennshots not working.. :-S
,inkyjam,2010-11-17T11:05Z,"Original source was a Chinese Side-by-Side Screener.
English cam-rip audio added.
Converted to Anaglyph with Stereo Movie Maker.
Original anaglyph size is 1280x720...
This is a shrunken version of the original...
The glasses you get at the theatre won't work with this. You need the Red/cyan anaglyph's.
Cheers!"
