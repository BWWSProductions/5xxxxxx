This is a 3.15Gb Divx file of Suicide Club [Jisatsu SÃ¢kuru{Original Title}].

54 high school girls throw themselves in front of a subway train. This appears to be only the beginning of a string of suicides around the country. Does the new all-girl group Desert have anything to do with it? Detective Kuroda tries to find the answer, which isn't as simple as one could hope.  

Amazing movie if you don't mind reading subtitles.
Recommend to anyone looking for a good movie that's just off the beaten path.
Its very intimidate and draws you in quick.
Don't expect much closure in this story. In my opinion, the best movies leave you thinking.
