"Our Kind of Love" is the title of a song recorded by American country music group Lady Antebellum. Written by the trio along with Michael Busbee, it serves as the third single from their second studio album, Need You Now. It debuted at number 50 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts dated for May 24, 2010.

The lyrics discuss the kind of relationship a couple has as they go through life, they keep it fresh and fun and donâ€™t take themselves too seriously. They describe their love as "just like drivin' on an open highway/ never knowing what we're gonna find." It is a mid-tempo to up-tempo song.

The song received mainly mixed reviews. Matt Bjorke of Roughstock stated that ""Our Kind of Loveâ€ recalls both the trioâ€™s debut albumâ€™s hits (like â€œLove Donâ€™t Live Hereâ€ and â€œLookinâ€™ For A Good Timeâ€) and the other more textured stuff found on the double platinum Need You Now, the single features an interesting sonic soundscape and finds Charles Kelley getting his first â€˜leadâ€™ of the singles from this album and like moody title tune, this one comes off as a true duet."

The song debuted at #80 on the Billboard Hot 100 as a digital-only single. Upon its release as an official single it re-entered the chart at #94 and is now at #69.

Need You Now is the second studio album from country music group Lady Antebellum. The album was released on January 26, 2010, via Capitol Nashville.
