     new vid, take note this was completely progressive (no            
     dupes/ghosting) as it had been sped up from 23.97 to 25fps.       
     Since the CDDA proved this (source vs cdda didnt match), the      
     source audio had to have a time stretch to speed back up with     
     the cdda, for the additional sfx (at start and end) to sync       
     with the rest of the video. The CDDA was edited with the sfx,     
     and not effected by the time change.                              
                                                                       
     Also the video had to be assumed back to 23.97 to sync            
     properly. A stunning high quality, video, shame not all           
     converts can come like this.. :( enjoy!
