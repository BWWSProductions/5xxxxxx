,dlarrym,2010-07-19T23:20Z,"MANY THANKS!! I LOVE this show. It was made with some of the guys involved with Aqua Teen Hunger Force. ""Granny's"" voice, is made by the same voice actor that is the voice for ""MASTER SHAKE"" on ATHF. There was even a episode of SPACE GHOST COAST to COAST where MeatWad, and Early Cuyler were his guests. ANYWAY. Thanks again, I am a HUGE animation fan. Also, can you find the 9th episode for season 5. I do not have the means to get it off the Adult swim website or I'd upload it. PLEASE if you can, I and many others would be very grateful."

,rmffb,2010-07-20T02:35Z,"no,,Dana Snyder does granny and shake,,,and gazpacho from chowder "
,dlarrym,2010-08-07T19:58Z,"@ElmoHatesMudbloods: rmffb is absolutely right. He also does the voice for ""The Monk"" from the Venture Bros. 

You know who I mean, the guy in a Brown Robe, his head is bald on top with a ring of hair around the side of his head, Rosary Beads around his waist. . .all of the above is EXACTLY Like a Monk would wear. ABOUT the character I called the ""Monk"", ( I now see that he IS labeled an ALCHEMIST by an article at WIKIPEDIA. However, I am unsure if the writers of the VENTURE BROS call that character an Alchemist.

 Dr. Byron Orpheus, (the character I was thinking is the Alchemist/Magic User/Wizard guy is voiced by:  Steven Rattazzi), His character is a parody or ""rip"" of vintage comic book magic-users such as Doctor Strange and the even older (and cornier) Mandrake the Magician.

 Jefferson Twilight (voiced by Charles Parnell) - The black guy that sort of looks like ""SHAFT"" but also looks sort of like the Marvel Comics character ""BLADE"" with the 2 swords mounted on his back. These 3 characters form: ""THE ORDER OF THE TRIAD""

Lastly, I know it is just a cartoon, but to be accurate, any person claiming to be an ALCHEMISTS were PUNISHED and PERSECUTED by the Church, The Catholic Church to more precise. So It makes no sense that a MONK, with his Rosary Beads, his MONK hair cut, His Dark Brown robe he wears, etc, would be labeled an ALCHEMIST. To call him a CLERIC, or a DRUID, makes a lot more sense to me. But we are saying the same thing, that DANA SNYDER does the voice of (1) Master Shake from ATHF (2) The Alchemist from the Venture Bros.(that should be called a Monk, Cleric, or Druid in my opinion) (3) Gazpacho from the show CHOWDER. (4) LASTLY, the voice from the Squidbillies: Ruby Jean ""Granny"" Cuyler. I seldom post BS, I would never post bogus info on purpose. Sadly somw enjoy posting BS, just to get a reaction or to send people on a ""wild goose chase"" or on a SNIPE hunt! Walk Well All."

ALSO, I just read that NEW VENTURE BROS. are coming out in the fall!!! I can't wait. Another of my favorite Animated Shows. Take care all."
