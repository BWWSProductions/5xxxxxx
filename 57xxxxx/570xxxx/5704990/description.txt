           "Godspeed" is an intense, dramatic thriller set in the         
           lingering light of the Alaskan midnight sun. Charlie           
           Shepard is a modern day faith healer, a man who claims         
           that if you let go and believe, then his power to heal is      
           very real indeed. Living a hand-to-mouth, blue collar          
           existence with his wife Rebecca and young son, Charlie         
           ekes out a meager living from his "healing" sessions.          
           With his marriage failing, and an old drinking habit           
           coming back to haunt him, his family is brutally murdered      
           by unknown assailants for seemingly no reason whatsoever.      
           Six months later, Charlie has abandoned his former life        
           and the house his family lived in, moving through the          
           days' slow existence more like a ghost than a man. But         
           then a young, mysterious girl named Sarah appears in           
           town, and seeks out Charlie. She will become the link to       
           his family's killings and to the murderers themselves,         
           ultimately leading to tragic, violent consequences for         
           all. "Godspeed" is a film that explores faith, grief, and      
           the dark, violent nature that may very well exist in all       
           of us -- where man is still truly lost and at the mercy        
           of the Last Frontier of the great Alaskan landscape.
