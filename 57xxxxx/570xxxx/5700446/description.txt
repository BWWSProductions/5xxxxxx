A Russian teen escapes his country due to religious persecution only to find the same in the USA.
At 17 Peter Smyslov performs a daring escape out of the Soviet Union that frees him from the religious persecution that still imprisons his family. Eventually, Peter fulfills his dream of living in the United States, and begins the amusing struggle of adapting to the lifestyle of his new American host family, the McBrides.
Peter learns some tough lessons about being a Christian in America when he experiences persecution instead of freedom at his new high school, and compromise instead of the convictions for the Christians he meets. This is an excellent film with a challenging message for all age groups.
