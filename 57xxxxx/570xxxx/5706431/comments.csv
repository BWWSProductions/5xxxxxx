[V],thethingy,2010-07-21T23:59Z,"rcnsit, no its its own installer"
,cweb512,2010-09-03T06:47Z,Does this work with Powerpoint 2010
,cweb512,2010-09-03T07:03Z,I don't think it does because the installer says it cannot detect powerpoint even though I have the 2010 version installed
,Steerage,2011-04-05T18:17Z,"How do I get this to work if I have office 2010?
Without that is, dlng another version of office and then deleting all but PP?"
,LuckyDD,2011-04-09T15:05Z,"Hy!

First of all I  would like to thank you for ALL your great torrents. They're the best! I look for your stuff, first of all, any time I need something from Adobe or Microsoft. Thank you!
Now... the reason for which I'm writing you: I would like to install/use Presenter 7, but I kind of got stuck.
I have installed licenced Windows 7 Proffesional, MS Office 2010 Proffesional Plus (torrents), your Flash, Photoshop, Captivate and Acrobat Pro Extended 9, I've installed just PowerPoint 2007 trough a custom install from a torrents' Enterprise version that I've used for a long time without any problems and, because I('ve) use(d) PowerPoint a lot I'd like to install the Presenter.
The instalation works without problems up to finish and opening that ""Getting Started"" presentation.
When going in the Presenter tab, any button I hit (click) gives me an error message saying ""Adobe Presenter failed to open because either it is not licenced or there is an error in the licensing system. Please close and re-launch PowerPoint and enter serial number to license it. If this problem persists, reinstall this product and try again."" And, trust me, I've tryed them all, several times each!
Also the Presenter icon says ""Adobe Presenter Sample"" and exactly - exactly! - the same happens if I download and install the trial version from Adobe's site.
Could this be from my version of Office 2007, even though I've used it for years and installed it on more than 30 PCs over time, all without any problem, including using it along with Office 2010 Beta as long as it was available.
I know you have your own life and problems, but if you could find the time, whenever you can, to answer my post it would be of great help. :)

Have a nice day and thanks again!"
