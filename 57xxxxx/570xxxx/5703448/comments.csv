,nhprm,2010-07-20T04:01Z,"Ok, I understand you wont share how you make them look so good, but at least tell me what I can do to make the iPod setting compatible with PSP?  I'm dying here.  I made it with AVB 720, and size about 480x208 and it won't play on iPod... Any ideas why?"
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-07-20T04:21Z,"@ nhprm - I would be more than happy to help you. I think OOO & I use the same program, based on several things, but I can't be 100% sure unless OOO will confirm it. (^_^)    Do you have a hotmail account?  Anyways just leave a comment on my latest torrent, and I will do my best to help you. "
[T],on.off.on,2010-07-20T04:33Z,@nhprm if you lower the birate to like 500 and keep the sound at 128bit.. and same resolution as mine you should be good for psp. Also try the ipod touch profile maybe theres better luck with that one for you :-) coding movies is all about trial and error u just got to keep trying mate
