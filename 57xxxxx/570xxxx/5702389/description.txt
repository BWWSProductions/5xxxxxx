actual errors: In a common Hollywood mistake, Captain Sossa is demoted to 1st Lieutenant. Military Law does not allow for the demotion of commissioned officers (Lieutenants, Captains, Majors, Colonels, and Generals in the Army, etc.; Ensigns, Lieutenants, Commanders, Captains, and Admirals in the Navy) even after a trial by General Court Martial, never mind the nonjudicial environment seen in the film. The worst that would typically happen in the events of the film is a Letter of Reprimand (LOR) for Dereliction of Duty which would probably end the officer's chances for promotion, and effectively her career. Using the LOR and having it torn up at the end of the film would have been a more accurate portrayal of military justice and kept the plot in place.
