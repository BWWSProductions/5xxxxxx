,ron916,2010-09-11T22:05Z,12 potential viruses is more than just false positives: http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=471c55d6cbd7b265c2c8cfc3d627182b95c2ff86014b8a815b04b903c5b4d7e2-1284235343
,italianskill,2010-09-13T12:44Z,Scanned it with a-squared and it found: Trojan.backdoor.agent!IK (high risk). Trusted member my ass
[T],JugzG0nn4G3tY4,2010-09-14T21:40Z,"Well from the virus scan, 12 out of 40 is pretty good if you ask me. And with 338 seeds and 2 cryers, not a big deal... You say 12 potential. how do you know yourself unless you try. Besides, most cracks and keygens for programs are technically trojans because they change the program to make it a full version. So, @ron916 and @italianskill, make sure you know how to use the piratebay before you go and complain."
,iiipm,2011-03-31T05:31Z,the crack works but the key gen  does install 3 different torjans/viri  so be prepared to clean your system  if you get this and amke sure you check your firewall settings  after you install

I've been using Alcohol 120 1.9.8 for a long time and I forgot what crack I used for that one. So I was weary on which torrent I should get for the latest version 2.0.1. I installed a virtual machine and decided to test out the various cracks.

Everything is going to require you to first install the program. Directly after you install it, don't bother running it yet because it's not going to work until you use a crack.

1. ""Cracks\keymaker"" -- It sounds like Alcohol will simply find some way to invalidate any keys you make, so don't bother with this.
2. ""Cracks\AutoLoader_LdR_Alcohol Retail"" -- The RmK-FreE auto-loader. I think this loader works for 30 days and then the trial nagging window comes up and you have to push the Register button on it. That is UNACCEPTABLE, in 30 days you are going to forget about the register button fixing the program.
3. ""Cracks\ChVL"" -- This installs itself as some kind of background process to your windows and I guess that background service is supposed to crack Alcohol 120. Fuck that shit, it's too suspicious.
4. ""Cracks\Loader by Cheerpipe v1.3"" -- Requires you to go into ""C:\Program Files\Alcohol Soft\Alcohol 120"" and rename your Alcohol.exe into Alcohol__.exe with TWO underscores. Then you slip the new alchohol.exe into it's place as a loader that will use the file you just renamed. Now you just use your regular Alcohol 120 desktop or start menu shortcuts. You don't have to modify your Windows Hosts file or any bullshit. Minimal effort.

I looked this up on my PC with Alcohol 1.9.8. Turns out that I've successfully been using the Cheerpipe crack since 2009 since I have that double underscore file in my machine. It has never nagged me about registering."
