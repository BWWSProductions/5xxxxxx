The undead are among us and livelier than ever when Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, and a talented group of young-bloods star in Interview with the Vampire, the spellbinding screen adaptation of Anne Rice's best seller. Award-winning box-office favourite Cruise stylish plays the supremely evil and charismatic vampire Lestat. Pitt is Louis, jured by Lestat into the immortality of the damned, then tormented by an unalterable fact of vampire life: to survive, he must kill. Stephen Rea, Antonio Banderas, Christian Slater and newcomer Kirsten Dunst also star. One lifetime alone offers plenty of opportunities for the savage revelries of the night. Imagine what an Eternity can bring. Hypnotically directed by Neil Jordan, Interview with the vampire offers enough thrills, shocks and fiendish fun to last a lifetime...and beyond.
