Scheduled Guests
................

NOTE :: Today's 4 HOUR show consists entirely of previously broadcast material.  The Infowars web site describes the show this way:

Alex welcomes talks with English writer, public speaker, and former media personality David Icke. Additional guests include the producer of the landmark documentary The Money Masters, Bill Still, and Gerald Celente, trend forecaster, publisher of the Trends Journal, business consultant, and author who makes predictions about the global financial markets and other events. Rocker, former guitarist for The Amboy Dukes, and advocate of the Second Amendment and hunting rights, Ted Nugent, also talks with Alex.

The only live portion of the broadcast is when Ted Anderson [owner of the GCN radio network] comes on to plug his gold business, Midas Resources.


----------

The David Icke interview is from July 8.
The Bill Stills interview is from July 2.
The Gerald Celente interview is also from July 2.
And the Ted Nugent interview is from July 9.



In the closing seconds of yesterday's [Wednesday, July 21] show, Alex said: "Powerful broadcasts coming up tomorrow and on Friday and back live on Sunday, 4:00 to 6:00 p.m.."
So I think it is likely that tomorrow's show will also be repeat material.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
