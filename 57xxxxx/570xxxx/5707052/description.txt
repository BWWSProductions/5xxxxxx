Heavy digital work-outs from the first
Brainfeeder operative to not hail from Los
Angeles, Lorn. Cut together with acute
precision, Lorn's drums sound as clean and
crisp as any one currently surfing the
beat-wave while the microscopic, intensely
detailed patterns flicker like the best of
Nosaj Thing's output. Elsewhere we are
treated to fractured minimal-synth and
exotic hip-hop instrumentals lathered in
psychedelia and spat out more mongrel than
ever. Massive record for followers of this
vivid strain and featuring a mastering job
by Warp's Chris Clark.
