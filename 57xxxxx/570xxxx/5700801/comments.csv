Yep...some of these flicks are pretty poor in quality...=(  Most were ripped 15 or more years ago by various people.  Make sure you notice the description I provide and also try a search for a better quality rip before you download.

Otherwise, thanks for the comment and enjoy!"

Who would dare to watch The Things From Outer Space in clear picture? Your eyes would melt in HD!

Also, fuzzy pixels obscure the zipper on the Creature from the Black Lagoon."
