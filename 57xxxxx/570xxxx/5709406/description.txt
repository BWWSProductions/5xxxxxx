The original game opens on the evening of July 24, 1998 in the fictional Midwestern town of Raccoon City where a number of grisly murders had taken place on the outskirts of town. Victims were attacked in their homes by a group of assailants with evidence of cannibalism. Baffled by the strange nature of the cases, the Raccoon City Police Department sent in the S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team. Their mission was to investigate a mysterious mansion out in the woods... A mission they would not return from.

After contact was lost with their compatriots, Alpha Team quickly mobilized to find out what happened. Alpha Team located the downed Bravo Team helicopter, but only one body was found- the pilot Kevin Dooley, dead in the helicopter. The other six members were no where to found... Alpha Team quickly spread out to look for clues. As the group fanned out, Joseph Frost located a severed hand clutching a pistol. Frost was quickly beset by a pack of Cerberus and fatally mauled. Alpha Team pilot Brad Vickers panicked and flew off with, stranding the remaining four members: Captain Wesker, Barry Burton, Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine.
