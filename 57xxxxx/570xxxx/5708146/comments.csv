,Lord-Darkstorn,2010-07-24T00:06Z,"Forgot to mention, it's not actually 720p. It's 1280x528. It still looks phenomenal, however."
[V],Team_xRG,2010-07-26T03:10Z,"its 720p but black bars removed.. if there were black bars on top and bottom it would have been 1280x720... they are not needed cos player in wwhich ur playing this file makes them on its own
so by removing them lot of bitrate is saved :) "
