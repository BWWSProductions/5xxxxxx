The London-based Godfathers add guitarist Chris Burrows (in place of Kris Dollimore) to their lineup for their fourth studio album, Unreal World. 
Veteran producer Steve Brown (the Cult, the Pogues, Manic Street Preachers) takes the helm and the results are never less than satisfying. The Godfathers deliver muscular and meaty rock & roll with the energy of the Ramones and the Stooges, and a nod toward '60s melodicism. 
The title track kicks things off with a standard-issue condition of the world lyric over a propulsive guitar-driven sonic bed. Lead singer Peter Coyne is a powerhouse vocalist and the chorus is snappy and infectious. 
The rest of the album, which gets stronger as it progresses, ranges from the sweet, unabashed guitar pop of "Believe in Yourself" and "Drag Me Down Again" to the metallic stomp of the equally hooky "Something Good About You" and "Can't Try Harder." 
Unreal World is a thunderous slab of rock played with passion and sincerity. (AMG)
