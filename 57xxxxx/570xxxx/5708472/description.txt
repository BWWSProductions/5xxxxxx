The Walking Dead #75
By: Robert Kirkman, Ottley, Adlard, Cliff Rathburn

Lines are crossed, rules are broken and the peace and tranquility of the community is shattered. After months of safety and security are Rick and the crew even prepared for what they now face? As an added bonus: A very special back-up story drawn by RYAN OTTLEY in FULL COLOR, a first for THE WALKING DEAD! This issue is not to be missed.
