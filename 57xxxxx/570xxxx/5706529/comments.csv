,Asuraku,2010-07-22T19:59Z,Any way to re-map keys? I'm just looking to do wsad instead of the arrow keys since I'm on a laptop.
,whyse,2010-07-23T23:53Z,"You can change the ""abuserc"" config file to re-map the keys. Path to abuserc: ~/.abuse/abuserc or ~/Library/Application Support/Abuse/abuserc , depends on the version of the game. Please have a look at the manpage to get more info about the config file:   http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man6/abuse.6.html"
