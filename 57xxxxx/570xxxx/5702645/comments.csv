,PukingRabbit321,2010-07-20T18:16Z,"Why can't I watch this on my laptop? It's 100% downloaded, I'm using vista, but only bits and pieces I am able to watch. Can someone help me out?"
,KLEINBEIN,2010-07-21T11:28Z,"EP 6 should be available for download today, right?"
,whapper,2010-07-22T00:17Z,"Chances are you are only able to see bits and parts of it is because it is encoded in H.264 which uses up a lot of computing power to play. Also, it's in high def, which means you need even stronger of a computer to play it without any hiccups."
