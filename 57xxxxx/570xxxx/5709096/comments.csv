Seems You Tried The  >># If you have any sound trouble, like Crackling sounds in between the game or the audio doesn't syncs or similar to that. All you have to do is :

-> Open Console and type the following Command

snd_rebuildaudiocache


And Did Not Let It Complete..

How about you guys expertises concerning The Passing CTD!? "

Maybe Blaze has a hint!? Do others have the same prob!? It is so bad luck since that is the maybe most interesting campaign! :-("
,JnF47,2010-07-28T14:32Z,"Okay, I will try that campain and se if it works for me.

,hitme1024,2012-07-09T01:15Z,The sound is messed up :(
,hitme1024,2012-07-09T01:16Z,I also did try going to the console and putting in snd_rebuildaudiocache though it worked but it happens every time I start the game -.- It would not be a such a big deal if it did not happen every time.
