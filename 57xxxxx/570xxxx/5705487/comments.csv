Great show yesterday - I highly recommend the American Spectator article that was discussed.
Also the discussion @ The Belmont Club site with a very complimentary discussion of it in the 'replies' column.

Good insight into the ""Ruling Class"" which our elected representatives - on both sidesa of the aisle - have evolved into.


Shut Up Maria!"

Tainan: I never did hear yesterday's program. I think I have a kidney stone - my kidney was 'talking' to me for 2 days now.

I used two of my vacation days for yesterday and today. I'm a stubborn old cuss. 

It's so quiet in here - you telling Maria to shut up obviously works!
