,billyboy999,2010-07-24T16:57Z,So i take it then that u/loaders have given up on getting a new source without the 2nd half of the movie being unwatchable -probably have to wait now until a screener or even dvd rip comes out ---CRAP---
,billyboy999,2010-07-25T01:39Z,couple of weeks now and no decent copy out yet? cheers e/body for your u/loads but we r all dying to see a good/alrightish copy of this ...one with at least a watchable 2nd half..
