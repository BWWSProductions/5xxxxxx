Bound in human flesh, inked in blood, and amazingly hard to pronounce, the ancient "Necronomicon," or "Book of the Dead," transports a department store clerk and his '73 Oldsmobile into England's Dark Ages to face legions of undead beasts in director Sam Raimi's (A Simple Plan) outrageously hilarious sword-and-sorcery epic starring Bruce Campbell (The Evil Dead).

Ok,I have an Anchor Bay release of this and now an MGM release(I borrowed it from a friend)and here is the diffrences I noticed:
All Anchor BayÂ´s prints are missing a short 2 second shot: After Sheila is first captured and presented to Evil Ash, he rips Sheila's dress down to her waist. Explaining the next shot of looking her up and down.
The movie is the director's cut and so the original ending is included not the one with the supermarket,and this version is 96 minutes long.I did notice that the Anchor Bay versions look cropped on all four sides in some scenes and even zoomed in others,where the picture quality on this looks far superior.

The MGM version also includes possibly the best 5.1 mix created for this film as well.Enjoy guys!!!
