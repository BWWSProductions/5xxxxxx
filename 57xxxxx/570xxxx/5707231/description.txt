- Sacred Baboon (1976) -


YES meets GENTLE GIANT - crazy?

Daring such balancing act by a US-band in 1976 wasn't the best idea to obtain great publicity. Consequently YEZDA URFA remained almost unnoticed in their home country.

"...although they played and recorded between 1973 and 1981 they didn't release any albums, aside from a demo album in 1975 called Boris.

Their first demo didn't atract any interest from the record labels, so they financed and recorded an album by themselves, hoping it would help them in getting a record deal. They were only offered a bad deal by a small record company, so they declined (they kept the T-Shirts, they were handed out though). They finished "Sacred Baboon" as the album was called in 1976, but due to lack of funds they shelved it, and in 1981 they called it a day, and the band split up to pursue other interests, mostly out of the music scene.

In 1985 a guy called Peter Stoller got his hands on their debut demo album and brought it to the attention of Greg Walker from Syn-Phonic records, and thus YEZDA URFA were finally discovered, which resulted in the release of their hidden gem "Sacred Baboon" in 1989..."
