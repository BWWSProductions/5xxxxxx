,tomytig,2010-07-22T09:03Z,"why do you ""rar"" a file when its only 40 kib big?? You know there is a lot of virus on the net so why dont you just have the files open so we can see.. Much lesser risk that way. I can not trust your files and no one should"

for people not in the us you need to go to acc management then download history and redownload the game

then when it says its finished press the guid button and play(the download should take less then a minute as you all ready have it on your hdd)"
,Raptor2234,2010-07-28T02:05Z,Whenever I go to put the MoH beta folder in the 00000000 folder modio doesnt respond...and xplorer360 says that the file may be too big...is there something I'm doing wrong?
,oNirvashx,2010-07-28T10:11Z,whenever i start the game it says i need to be on an account that purchased it.
,nslewand,2010-07-29T17:58Z,"@ oNirvashx.... I ran into this issue as well, and I found a fix. Log into the new beta account and start up the beta. once it starts and is loading, pull your internet connection so it says not connected to xbox live, 10 minutes remaining. Then plug it back in and switch to your profile and it works. Enjoy!"
,M4JOR,2010-08-01T12:39Z,@ nslewand ... Thanks for the fix I've been missing it since I got the same error as oNirvashx
