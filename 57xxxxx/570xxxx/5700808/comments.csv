,umarnawazkhan,2010-09-02T09:11Z,"change your upload video's to MP4 or MKV
for high quality, small file size
720p - x264

What is x264?

x264 is an open-source encoder for the H.264 codec used for High-Definition movies on HD-DVDs and Blu-Ray Discs. It has a high compression which is way superior to xvid. That means you get more quality at equal bitrates. A 700MB x264 rip will be sharper and more detailed than a 700MB xvid rip from the same source. x264 is the future in DVDrips!

What is a .mkv file?

MKV means matroska video and it is a extensible open standard Audio/Video container (AVI is a container, too!). This file format combines several video streams, audiostreams, subtitles, chapters and information in only one file. It supports new standards like 6-channel AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) audio or x264 video "

You guys are some proper FUCKIN black-bearded eye-patched pirates!

ARR!"
,only1alive,2010-09-06T01:18Z,"@umarnawazkhan

One reason to not change the video format to MKV is this:

Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 allow media streaming from a PC, which requires the file to be in a certain format to play, or the system will not recognize the file.

I, for one, choose to only download .AVI's due to this reason.  Not only is it easy to play media through a device such as the above stated, but many users do not know much about MKVs or different media players other than what their PC came with.

The quality of the video may be less, but the hassle that comes with downloading movies and multiple players for those movies may cause would-be down loaders to look elsewhere. "

,whokilledbambi,2010-11-03T19:28Z,"@only1alive:

what are you talking about?
Try Google TVersity, or even better, download PS3 Media Server. The last one streams/transcodes mkv among other formats."

Thanks for the good quality!"

I only download avi's so I can watch via hard drive reader to tv. Mp4's and mkv doesn't work on it, so glad most people do avi :oD"

,reev3r,2011-07-18T01:38Z,"I am so frustrated with people griping about how ""complicated it is to get a player for each wrapper (.mkv, .avi, .divx etc. etc.)"", go to google, then take a moment to search for VLC.

If you are intelligent enough to forward ports for you torz, then you should be fully capable of finding an adequate player for your stolen video files.

Come on people, think!!!"
