Keenan! here, with his first EP, called 'EP!'. How imaginative.
It's 5 tracks of electronic goodness, ranging from house, to trance to minimal... all with my personal spice.
The whole EP is in 320kbs MP3 format, so it's decent quality to hear my music.
Hope you like it, and if you do, drop me an email at mmjkeenan@gmail.com to let me know!

Happy listening :)
