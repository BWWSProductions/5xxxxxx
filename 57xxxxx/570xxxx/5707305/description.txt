Having gone to such trouble to find a copy of this superb play I have decided to seed and share for the first time so others may enjoy it.

The Video quality is the best I can do, I'd say 8/9 out of 10 and the audio a solid 8 or possibly 8.5 - It's certainly watchable and the content is supremely enjoyable. For those like me who have been frustrated trying to find this gem - enjoy
