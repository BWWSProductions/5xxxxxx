Ray Tango and Gabriel Cash are narcotics detectives who, while both being extremely 
successful, can't stand each other. Crime Lord Yves Perret, furious at the loss of 
income that Tango and Cash have caused him, frames the two for murder. Caught with 
the murder weapon on the scene of the crime, the two have alibi. Thrown into prison 
with most of the criminals they helped convict, it appears that they are going to 
have to trust each other if they are to clear their names and catch the evil Perret.
