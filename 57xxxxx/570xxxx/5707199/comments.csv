Would you believe if I told you that TPB administrators are doing that too. Frequently.
Even very innocent information about the fallibility of their service.
They call it trolling (complaining)
This is how it looks
?Your forum account is currently banned. Ban Reason: trolling
Ban will be lifted: Never?

So, do not dare to complain to the arrogant gods of Pirate Bay.
The ones that (as most gods do) live of our visits and contributions.
Hmmm, should we send them to the ""enlightening service"" course?
Who knows maybe the ""pirate gods"" have the capability to realize that they are just another service company.
Maybe not."
