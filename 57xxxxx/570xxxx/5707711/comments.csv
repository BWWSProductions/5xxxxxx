If you read the definition, it says quote
""Language: None, audio is music only. ""

And the definition and screenshots goes on to explain exactly what your getting so therefore your comment is completely useless and just shows how big of waist of space you are.

Anyways, thanks for the upload, looks freakin sweet in HD on the 60 inch. Trippy visuals, like a hella glorified screensaver. Thanks again."
