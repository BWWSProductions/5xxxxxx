Ripped from the original 1983 LaserDisc

I was ask for a higher res of this LD.  I have an AVERMEDIA video input card and is says it is 720 X 480. I selected "best" quality amd MPEG-2.  The file size reflects the better quality, but I do not know how to varify it.

I uploaded the AVI because of file size.  I did all the LDs originally as MPG2 Best so can upload others if there is interest.

This LaserDisc was done as a documentary of the Beatles.  There is a Lot of early material from Liverpool, Germany and the original trip to the US and the Ed Sulivan as well as the later material.

I have seen lots of the later Beatles clips and material, but never this much of the formative years.

Front and Back Cover art.


Enjoy and PLEASE seed!
