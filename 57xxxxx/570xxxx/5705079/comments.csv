,trymeoutimhot,2010-07-20T22:23Z,"let?s be clear: Inception is a reasonably easy movie to understand?

BUT POORLY DONE
Most people will be wowed by teh film cause of its context narrative, but once you peel off the onion layer, its still an onion. 
this is what happens when you have been force fed shitty films for a long time, and then shown an Average film, you tend to think its golden syrup"

,trolluder,2010-07-21T22:26Z,"titan41462, you stupid troll-fuck...  go away and stay away for gods sake.... Crawl back to what fucking slimy shithole you came from, everyone shoul be glad then!

A simple a/v comment will do it just fine.
Subutex74, got it right from start, look who has UL?ed the damn thing, that in our world meens no bloody maleware, no spamshit or any of that.
TvTeam is as legit as it gets for us moochers.

I know some fake torrents have as many seeders as TvTeam have sometimes, but that just showes how braindead some of the stupid fucks really are here!

Sorry for the off topic guys, just get so pissed off at some of the stupid shitholes here from time to time.

Referinging to it as a cam, Ill give it A3/V3. It all depends on how badly you wanna se it tonight?
You may not see every second of the movie with this copy, as I said, how badly do you want to see it now?  Personally I want it bad so I?ll se it, then I?ll se it again on bluray later....

Thank you TvTeam for putting your precious time into this so that the most desperate of us can see it really fast no matter what quality, you truly are the cr?me de la cr?me of torrents, always!"
,les79,2010-07-22T04:11Z,"The quality... I'll give it a 5 at the very best... But the end cuts off then repeats and goes on for a total of 3:57:41.  It would've been better if it had the end  on it...
Don't waste your time. This is the 3rd one I've downloaded... haven't found anything worth my time yet.
Thanks anyways though."
,Vegas23,2010-07-22T06:40Z,"seriously, this is a movie you should see in the cinema first. download after if you must, but I swear don't ruin it by seeing it in bad quality first time round."
,bballjoey24,2010-07-22T10:41Z,prolly the worse cam ive ever seen
,ronston,2010-07-22T10:54Z,this is not a very good cam copy at all.a/3 v/3 is the most i would give this.wait for a better copy
,bigneilly,2010-07-22T16:48Z,thank you
,lizards_online,2010-07-22T20:00Z,"Sorry TVTeam, I appreciate the effort that you've made but this is pretty much unwatchable.

From what I've read in reviews this is a film you really need to be able to and hear clearly else you won't have the foggiest idea of what's going on.

I lasted less than 5 minutes with this upload - A:4 / V:4"
,tjbro,2010-07-23T02:07Z,"Honestly, Fuck you, this is the New Zealand Film ""boy"" waste of time, fukn bifkin"
