I can confirm that it is working.

1.Install DVD Box
2.Install Update v2.1
3.Start -8i/F Installer
4.When the installer ask you to validate press ?Abort?
5.On the Popup asking you to leave the installer press ?No?
6.Now press ?Back? on the validation page
7.On the page of the user terms press ?next? again
8.Now the installer jumped the validation process and you can install the update
9.Use config manager to switch to -8i/F mode
10.Fly

Very nice model. "

,1sh1g4mi,2010-11-09T02:29Z,"Thats because you did not switch the mode from the -400 to the -8/F in the config manager like I said.

Btw. I'm the leaker. For some reason TBP uploaded three of my leaked torrents as anonymous... "
