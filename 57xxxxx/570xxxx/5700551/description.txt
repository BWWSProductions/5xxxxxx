Extension model for the PMDG 747-400X Queen of the sky to the latest -8i/F variant.

This update may only be applied to the DVD-Version of the PMDG 747-400 that I leaked on TPB.

Installation:

1.Install DVD-Box
2.Apply update to v2.1
3.Install extension model without using enable button or *.dll method
4.During the installation of update the registration window will pop out, the second one with inactive button Next, press cancel and back
5.Pray
6.Play

Reminder: Add reg key always after all installations and updates are finished. Otherwise the updates will bomb your FSX.

As always I'm not the author of the original torrent. And maybe I just uploaded it to infiltrate your network with a Trojan or laugh my ass off while you whine about your broken FSX.
