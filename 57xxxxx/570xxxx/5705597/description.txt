Â°  FYI, Aussies should pronounced Gotye as "gore-ti-yeah", using that    Â°
Â°  inimitably dry and elongated sound they call an 'accent'!             Â°
Â°                                                                        Â°
Â°  Wally can say that because he was born in Belgium (and he speaks      Â°
Â°  English good).                                                        Â°
Â°                                                                        Â°
Â°  Parties from overseas wishing to "name-check" Wallyâ€™s musical         Â°
Â°  moniker should employ a complex system of pops and clicks, or         Â°
Â°  alternatively, engage in a series of hand symbols that represent the  Â°
Â°  following character: Â§                                                Â°
Â°                                                                        Â°
Â°  This is because their accents are even worse than those of            Â°
Â°  Australians, and they do not make English. Good.                      Â°
Â°                                                                        Â°
Â°  Australian music kicks arse. Always has, always will. We're just glad Â°
Â±  that you're all  on board for the ride.  We here at OZM will continue Â°
Â°  to  shove  Australian  music  right  in your  face proving  that it's Â°
Â°  equal  to, and  usually  better, than  any  other  international  act Â°
