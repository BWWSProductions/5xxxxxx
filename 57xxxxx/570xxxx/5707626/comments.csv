,wira020,2010-10-06T22:07Z,"The first movie needs a bit of an adjustment to the subtitle.. I think minus(-) 1700 milisecond (ms) will do fine.. just use remux program like mkvmerge gui.. wont take more than a few seconds... everything else is great.. good image quality and good audio.. thanks alot dude.. you're doing great!

Thanks YiFY"
,southak,2011-11-11T18:20Z,AAC is garbage. I understand people want small files but for me I want a bit more quality i.e. DTS sound and 720p minimum. If I have to wait for it to download then thats fine. Still good job to the original uploader for giving a lot of people what they want.
