About:
This is the loader application thats used by millions of people worldwide, 
well known for passing Microsoft's WAT (Windows Activation Technologies) and is arguably the safest Windows activation exploit ever created. 
The application itself injects a SLIC (Software Licensing Description Table) into your system before Windows boots, 
this is what fools Windows into thinking it's genuine.
