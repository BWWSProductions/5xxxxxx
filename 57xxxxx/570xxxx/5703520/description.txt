NOTE - For the young and for Americans who may not know, NOT ONLY...BUT ALSO... was the infamous pairing of Dudley Moore and Peter Cook that gave rise to all the famous anti-establishment comedy that followed from the mid - 1960s onward. They were particularly inspirational for Monty Python. Sadly, following the asinine BBC practice of the time, most of the video tape saving the series was wiped clean for new shows, and most of the series was lost forever. This torrent contains the remaining shows that have been released on DVD, as well as a 2010 BBC special wherein modern comedians re-enact some of the best of the lost sketches. Thx to the box dot bz for that special. I have also included a couple of their LP albums and short film clip of a sketch that gets cut off part way through.

The show was originally intended as a solo project for Moore, called Not Only Dudley Moore, But Also His Guests. However, unsure about going it alone, Moore invited his partner from Beyond the Fringe, Peter Cook, to guest in the pilot (along with Diahann Carroll and John Lennon, who was to make two more appearances during the course of the series). So popular was the double act Ã¢
