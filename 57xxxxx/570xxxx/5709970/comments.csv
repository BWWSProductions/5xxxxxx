,yurune,2010-07-23T23:15Z,"I love it either way, but I do prefer the mp4s.  I always want the highest quality, regardless of file size or format.

By the way, you totally rock!"
,yurune,2010-07-24T02:34Z,I totally noticed the improved quality from episode 4.  You're doing a great job!  I can't wait for 6! :D
,nickin2it,2010-07-24T08:27Z,"I downloaded this and some how it downloaded Antivir Pro Virus which raped my computer for a couple of hours after 4 hours of frustrating ways of trying to delete it I finally got rid of it.

Just saying this happened to me, not sure it'll happen to others that download this torrent but yeah."
,Paindrain,2010-07-24T08:39Z,"sorry your system had problems, but the files within themselves do not have viruses/spyware, its possible you connected to people with probs..."
,Paindrain,2010-07-24T08:51Z,"100% clean files, if there is problems its from the seeders, not the uploader"
,BrookesDad,2010-07-26T01:49Z,I've downloaded every episode he's uploaded so far and not a problem. If you downloaded a virus through one of the seeders I definitely suggest better virus protection.
