Najah Cruz has infiltrated the entourage of Sam Nachez, head of the international organised-crime ring known as the High Council. Shes an insider, working directly for the White House. And shes been cut off from her bosses.

While corrupt forces in Washington are trying to identify her and kill Project Insiders, Najah goes to Pakistan with Nachez to arrange the sale of French cruise missiles to the Pakistani Air Force. But not everyone in Nachezs inner circle is convinced of her loyalty, and Pakistan is a troubled country in its own right?"
