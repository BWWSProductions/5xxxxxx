,Blind___Mag,2011-10-07T10:16Z,"I downloaded Season 1 from this pack and it was horrible.

Episode 1: Rose - i could heard people talking for the first 10 minutes.
Episode 2 - There was less than 2 minutes of the episode before it changed to Season 6 confidential.
then Episodes 3-5; were all glitchy and unwatchable.

I haven't bothered downloading any more due to the bad quality. I like Doctor Who and the first two seasons are my favourite, shame i can't watch it with this particular torrent. Looks like i'll be going somewhere else."
,muhamadthejew,2012-01-03T03:53Z,resolution is 640x368 at 25fps great quality no glitches will seed
,M1LoN,2012-04-03T20:48Z,I really want to watch this... but i only get a max of 5 kB/s...
,MrEdTheHorse,2012-04-08T00:26Z,I can confirm background talking in the Rose episode.  Specifically at 5:10 into the episode.  It comes and goes a few times.  I haven't had the other problems that Blind___Mag mentioned though.  Episode 2 The End of the World seemed ok and didn't turn into the Season 6 Confidential as he described.  I've only checked a few episodes though but you'll have to get Rose from somewhere else at least to have better audio.  If Rose is the only one with a problem it's still a great collection.
