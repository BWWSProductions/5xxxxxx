,lilars26,2010-07-22T03:47Z,"@dydu28 Please tell  joinforfreefun to stop putting a link to your site on other people's sites I am asking nicely.If it continues we will be putting links here pointing to files that are even smaller than yours.He has a problem with us and he is putting you in the middle.I don't want to have a link war with you but if he continues,all bets are off."
,join4frreefun,2010-07-24T00:35Z,"Well, how cowardly and overzealous!
 You never once told me to stop, in fact it was I who told you I'd said my piece (and I did) before you did this. 

Oh, and for the record, I never said this was better than your dear leader's - I said it was an EQUAL alternative if your users were feeling obliged to donate (which they surely were). 
A less zealous (more secure? even magnanimous?) guy wouldn't have cared, you know. 
I suppose that naturally comes from following such hostile arrogance, though. Have a think about that (oh, and ask yourself why your leader never credits his source files).

You didn't need to advertise your group's as superior re filesize.  I suppose  that claiming I'M 'using' dydu28 allows you then to claim yours as superior with a clear conscience, does it?? 

I'm so glad I shook up your little group now (shamed them into stopping hoarding those torrents...and what about all those MU files;)), but I'm even more pleased I have an alternative now.

See ya, and I sincerely hope you learn think freely..."
,join4frreefun,2010-07-24T09:28Z,"Oh, and btw when I said this was an equal alternative I was actually being magnanimous (remember that?), shall I tell you why?
 Since you diplomatically boasted about your man's*, here it is-

this one's slightly larger because the RESOLUTION IS HIGHER: This is 624x352, yours is only 576x320. Encoding is not magic, you know (or maybe you don't, some of you seem quite dependent on your *Trusted Service Provider(tm)).

Now that really is all I have to say, apologies again to dydu28, hope you keep up the good work!"
,join4frreefun,2010-07-26T18:57Z,"Edit: ignore the above. My righteous indignation was not right. I half-knew I was not being magnanimous at all, lilars, and you were not cowardly at all, I apologize for that,  I was getting carried away with my wrong end of the stick. 
My allegations about the other group were quite unfounded. Always read before posting!

And my apologies to dydu, who must be really confused by now, as he had no part in this at all. Sorry again."
