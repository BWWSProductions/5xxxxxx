Release Notes: Used no grp and TA source thx, pulled all that green out adjusted colors increased brightness slightly,got rid of all that bad pixelation as far as the blurry parts cant do shit about that except sharpen a little,Audio lowered the bass increased treble till TA releases new source in a few days this will do.

,macedawg,2010-07-22T10:53Z,"ill try not to be too negative here, but this cam sucks terribly.... whoever was filming was eating from the loudest bag of chips ive ever heard, in addition to the already quiet voices in the film. in the middle, either the guy put his arm in front of the cam for about 30 seconds, or the cam cut out, but yea no video for a bit. oh

also the cam ends about 15 or so minutes before the movie does... so i reccomend you find a diff cam unless you like cliffhangers in which you will love this... but thank you hiest for posting this is the type of film you need to watch a couple times to fully enjoy so ill just go watch this in theatres haha"
