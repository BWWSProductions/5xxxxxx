 At eighteen years old, Bezerra de Menezes leaves the 
 northeastern Brazil to 
 Rio de Janeiro in order to study in Medical School. At    
 this time, Rio was the capital of
 the Republic, and he was elected congressman in various   
 legislatures, becoming one  
 of the most prominent defenders of abolitionist ideas
 and, ahead of his time, started  
 to raise environmental debates.  
 But what brings him greatest recognition was his
 anonymous work on behalf of the  
 needed. Being known lovingly as the ''Doctor of the  
 Poor''. 
 Whether as a politician devoted to humanitarian causes or 
 a physician known for  
 never denying relief to those who knocked on his door,    
 Bezerra de Menezes becomes  
 an important spiritual leader and remains alive in the    
 hearts of millions of Brazilians. A   
 life history marked by fraternal love and charity.   
 Bezerra is also known as the Brazilian.
