A black comedy about two old-time conmen who pretend to be able to communicate with the dead.

Dave and Lucky are a couple of ex-showbiz lads who have taken to spending their declining years pretending that they're mediums to the spirit world. Hapless housewives give them money and the two do a little research, set up a fake seance and one of them does an impression of the dead man as he speaks through a loudspeaker in the ceiling...
