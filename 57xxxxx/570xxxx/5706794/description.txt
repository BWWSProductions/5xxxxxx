There' s not a decent copy of this movie on the nets (except an awful TVrip w/ French subs), so I tried to fill this gap because it's probably one of the best post-communist Romanian films. Mostly for Romanian movie lovers.

English subs were hard coded in the original DVD source (ugly fonts and poor alignment but they'll do). Plays fine with vlc and mplayer.
