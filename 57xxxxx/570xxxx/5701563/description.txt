The Ice Road Truckers return to Alaska, hauling their biggest loads ever across the most
dangerous terrain they've faced. But this year, trucking critically needed cargo north to
the oil fields of Prudhoe Bay is just the beginning. The drivers will tackle frozen
rivers and swamps out beyond the Dalton Highway, hauling supplies to some of the most
remote towns of the Great White North.
