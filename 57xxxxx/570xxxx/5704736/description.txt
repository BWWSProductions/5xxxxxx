    Kurdish refugee, Renas, is living in the very north of Norway. In a      
    remote desolate house. In the middle of snowy nowhere. But soon his      
    special princess, Fermesk, will be joining him. Though the couple has    
    never met, they have already fallen in love from looking at each         
    other's photographs and talking on the phone. Their families have        
    performed a wedding ceremony back home in Iraq, and Fermesk is put on    
    a plane. The first encounter at the airport does not live up to their    
    expectations, however. Neither look very much like their flattering      
    photos would indicate. Fermesk is now a much bigger woman, and Renas     
    isn't quite the handsome young man anymore.
