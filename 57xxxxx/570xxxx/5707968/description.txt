[color=pink]Release Notes:[/color]
well...little late on this one..loaded the source file into vdub used a denoise filter, a smootheness filter, increased the 
brightness as it seemed quite dark, slightly changed the contrast to balance it out, then was onto colors, gave it some red 
and lowered the green. slightly changed the cyan...slight sharpness filter and few more things...this really has a bad crop.
lose alot of the picture....audio left untouched just encoded to mp3.
