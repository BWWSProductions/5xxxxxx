2000 Just Another Diamond Day [Bonus Tracks], [Remastered]    CD  Spinney SPINNEY001CD 

Vashti Bunyan (born 1945) is an English singer-songwriter.

Following the release of her first LP, Just Another Diamond Day, in 1970, Bunyan disappeared from the music industry until interest in her music was reignited in the early 2000s.

Just Another Diamond Day is the debut album of English singer-songwriter Vashti Bunyan.

In the mid to late 1960s, Bunyan was under contract to Andrew Oldham, which saw her release two singles. However, Bunyan found the experience frustrating, and decided to head for the Scottish islands in search of an artistic commune supposedly established by Donovan. She travelled around the countryside with her partner Robert in a horse-drawn wagon. It was during these travels that she wrote the songs which would later appear on Just Another Diamond Day.

Bunyan returned to London where she was urged by producer Joe Boyd to record her songs while they were still fresh. The recording session took place in December 1969 at Sound Techniques in London. Song arrangements were performed by Robert Kirby, who also worked with Nick Drake. Simon Nicol and Dave Swarbrick of Fairport Convention and Robin Williamson of The Incredible String Band contributed to some tracks. The album was initially released in 1970 but was a commercial failure and Bunyan retired from music for many years.

Just Another Diamond Day was re-released by Spinney Records in 2000, its success prompting Bunyan to return to music and eventually record the much delayed follow-up Lookaftering, released in 2005. Just Another Diamond Day was also featured in a UK TV advert for T-Mobile's Flext in 2006.

All songs written by Vashti Bunyan, except where noted.
