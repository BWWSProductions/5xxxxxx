,xiphone,2010-07-21T05:46Z,"dude why is your videos kinda distorted?
Its like the video is horrible. I havent checked this one but other movies like ""The A list"" etc are freakin messed up videos."
[T],on.off.on,2010-07-21T06:54Z,@xiphone on your iphone?
[T],on.off.on,2010-07-21T07:49Z,@xiphone whatever your trying here your doing it wrong.. lol
[V],poppedtart,2010-07-21T08:47Z,prolly just full of shit
,xiphone,2010-07-22T05:09Z,"dude i dont know what im doing wrong. I just download and put in my phone like normal.
Poppedtarts video works fine. But dude your one on an iphone is kinda distorted. Here is two screenshots from Killers and Eyeborg. 
The whole movie is distorted like that 80% of the time. And this happens on all of your videos. 
Is there any compatibility issue with iphone?

[T],on.off.on,2010-07-22T06:41Z,"hmm looks funky =) my ipod touch eats them raw and same with my friends psp. But I think it would be strange if nobody complained about it before... but i cant really say about iphones as i dont have one. If someone else with a iphone has the same problem please let me know. But then again mate i dont say anything about iphones in my files.. i say psp, ipod touch and zune... ;-)"
,xiphone,2010-07-24T05:27Z,"Dude everybody elses with PSP, Ipod, Zune works superbly with iphone. 
I guess if you match with holyroses or poppedtarts it wouldn't give any problem(if you are using the same program). Just a request.

 I tried it on another iphone and the same thing happens. 
A lot kid will be using iphone soon since their parents are getting newer ones. If you would please look into it that would be great. Anyways thanks man for the movies.

[T],on.off.on,2010-07-24T06:18Z,"@xiphone 

I suggest u dont download my movies then.. cuz Im not changing my software. it would also mean i should change my operationsystem too. almost 100 movies uploaded and your the first one having problems.. do the match.... Im not a jerk and I wish I could test it myself but with the few complaints I get its not worth all the hassle. "
[T],on.off.on,2010-07-24T06:50Z,wow i did sound like a jerk... lol but mate i dont know what to.. my movies are almost the same as poppedtart.. just a different codec. maybe the iphone doesnt like that i dont know... Again I wish i could help you man
,nagger7,2010-07-30T11:44Z,i have the same problem with the distorted video on ipod touch. its mostly when the pictures are moving very fast. i think its problem with the codec
[T],on.off.on,2010-07-31T02:18Z,"xiphone and nagger7 can you guyz try this one out and tell me if that works on ur devices?? thx in advance :
