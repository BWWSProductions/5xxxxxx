I found these offas well. Well, sort of. I transcoded them with Auto Gordian Knot to obtain the correct aspect ratio. The original codec was DivX 5 and the resolution 720x576. The source files were only 350 MB and the episodes are nearly 60 minutes each, so the quality isn't the greatest.

Season 5 (2004):

2 episodes
Codecs: XVID, MP3
Resolution: 720x416
File Size: 896 MB
External subtitles: No

Again, downloaded offand transcoded with AGK to correct the aspect ratio.
