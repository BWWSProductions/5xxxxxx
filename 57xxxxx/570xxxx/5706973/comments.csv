,tavery80,2010-09-10T05:13Z,"Well, it isn't English."
,tavery80,2010-09-10T05:19Z,CORRECTION - English narration is present on the AC3 track.
,irishpride86,2010-10-11T17:51Z,Is this the same as the one that's 4 DVD's? Because this one is only 3.

Why 7? Interesting, but there are errors. Can't trust the information, if they can't even get the name of the Battle of Britain right. (""Battle of England""?)"
,br00tality,2011-02-10T18:02Z,It is narrated in English. They are VOB files but Windows Media Player should run it.
