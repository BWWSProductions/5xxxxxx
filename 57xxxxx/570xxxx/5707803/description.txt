Love is a Grammy Award-winning soundtrack remix album of music recorded by The Beatles, released in November 2006. It features music compiled and remixed as a mashup for the Cirque du Soleil show of the same name. The album was produced by George Martin and his son Giles Martin, who said, "What people will be hearing on the album is a new experience, a way of re-living the whole Beatles musical lifespan in a very condensed period."

This is a bit-for-bit perfect rip of the album Love by The Beatles. It is a true "AUDIO_TS" rip from the Love DVD-Audio release (DVD-Audio is different than DVD-Video, it offers vastly superior sound quality). This is currently the only source for " high definition (24bit/96kHz) bit-for-bit native digital", "remixed and remastered" music from The Beatles. The Beatles in true high definition digital is an awesome experience. Not to mention, the remix of this album is fantastic, with tons of never released recordings. Any Beatles fan or audiophile must give this album a listen.
