,chelsmile,2010-09-20T00:56Z,"hey i downloaded this and the other borderlands +3DLC mac torrent, game works aside from the few bugs everyone has been talking about, But I can't die, my vehicles dont take damage, and my Health will reach 1, but then I just take damage without dying... 
I did research and saw there was a demigod mode that you could set to True located in the int files. I went to find this variable in the willowgame.int file and its not even there?

Help?"

,boyon12,2011-01-10T12:24Z,"ok i'm a little bit new at this so plz bear with me

I downloaded this and i unzipped it.

i right-clicked on the app and did show package contents. and got to Contents/Resources/transgaming/c_drive/Program Files/Gearbox Software/Borderlands/Willowgame/Localization

and sure enough i see the INT folder there.

but when i drag the INT folder i just got to there, it doesn't work at all!
I also tried copying the INT folder and pasting it to that place, but it still won't work.

PLZ HELP"
