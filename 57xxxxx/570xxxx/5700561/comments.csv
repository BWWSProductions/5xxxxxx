,hotrod666,2010-11-12T18:05Z,awesome man.. just deleted the old theatricals avi one..this is good guys
,Hazardic,2010-12-15T08:09Z,the audio is out of sync. It was off by a few seconds.
,checkalt666,2010-12-24T02:27Z,"Does Hazardic's informations proceed?
Downloading firts movie anyway.
Wait for reply."
,checkalt666,2010-12-26T04:15Z,"Checked the first movie and the audio is in perfect sync.
In MY OPINION, don't worth downloading this torrent now. If you didn't watch the movie yet, download the extended version in dvd-rip and wait for the bluray-rip comes available. Don't worth downloading 10 gBs of high quality normal version if you're going to download the extended version in high quality again."
,AlbatronX,2011-01-04T21:45Z,I downloaded all the samples but nothing seems to go right! I can't see anything...
,dwnldthis,2011-05-14T23:57Z,thank you
,TheWayHeWantsIt,2011-07-15T03:29Z,"I LOVE HDLiTE rips, good quality compared to size. Could u or somebody else in the crew upload lotr extendted version w/brrip, it's obviously out by now! Would be appreciated :D:D that was pretty much it!"
,AllzCool123,2012-04-13T14:14Z,NOT EXTENDED. Which really means it would be stupid to download this.
,southak,2012-04-29T20:34Z,@ Allz - errrr maybe some of us dont want to watch the extended versions? Maybe some of us aren't so stupid to realise that the extended editions are nothing but a marketing exercise and the original theatrical editions are far superior? Maybe some of us realise that if the extended editions were that good then they would have made it to the cinema instead :)
,osriccc,2012-05-27T21:51Z,"Is the source Blu-ray or 35mm? I mean, really... the quality is PERFECT. I miss HDLiTE so much. When I searched for something and read that name, it was like THIS ONE!!"
