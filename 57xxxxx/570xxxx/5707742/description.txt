Hancock's Half Hour was a ground-breaking and influential BBC radio comedy series of the 1950s, 

Tony Hancock starred as what was essentially an exaggerated version of his own character.
Usually portrayed as a down-at-heel comedian living at the dilapidated "23 Railway Cuttings" in East Cheam. 

Sid played a criminally-inclined confidante who would usually manage to con Hancock in some way.

Bill appeared as Hancock's dim-witted Australian lodger. 

The series broke with the variety tradition dominant in British radio comedy at that time, and instead of sketches, guest-stars and musical interludes, the humour developed from the characters and their situations.

Episodes of the radio series were included in the package of programs held in 20 underground radio stations of the BBC's Wartime Broadcasting Service (WTBS), designed to provide public information and morale-boosting broadcasts for 100 days after a nuclear attack.
