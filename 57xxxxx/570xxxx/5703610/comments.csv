[T],FatFreddy007,2010-07-20T05:14Z,"my friend help me, which means (schedule). is calendar? or list?"
[T],FatFreddy007,2010-07-20T05:36Z,@ctang I now understand your previous question... Upload I have no schedule.
,GUYMOVIE,2010-07-20T17:41Z,thanks man it is lot easier now to know about your next release nice job....keep on doing....
[T],ctang,2010-07-20T18:00Z,Update:  i will be doing White Chicks next and then Blow and then Freedom Writers
,mrluckyman,2010-07-20T18:56Z,I hope Freedom Writers is next
[T],ctang,2010-07-20T19:24Z,i can do Freedom Writers after White Chicks...i would do it next but i already encoded White Chicks
,mrluckyman,2010-07-21T07:35Z,I am surprised most ppl download my torrents then delete off but didn't leave seeding anyways so let you know I might use filesharing such as Netload or SharingMatrix tho.  I will upload my movies list soon.
[T],ctang,2010-07-21T18:33Z,hey gambitz: thanks for lending a helping hand but i figured it out...i was installing dvd-rb first and then installing cce which meant that i had to locate the cce path correctly...i didnt know that but when i figured it out everything worked as it should...been using it now for about a month and also love the quality of the compression
[T],ctang,2010-07-22T02:03Z,should be back up and seeding in about 3 hours...sorry for the downtime
[T],ctang,2010-07-22T05:52Z,well i was down for longer than expected but am back up and seeding!!! should be more seeders soon
