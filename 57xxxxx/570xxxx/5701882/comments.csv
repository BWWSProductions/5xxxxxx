,Destoroyah,2010-09-01T12:49Z,"1. unnecessarily large
2. split into way too many files (once again, unnecessary)
3. not english

this gets a thumbs down from me"
,Llehr,2010-09-11T13:07Z,"Do NOT download this torrent. All you will find is disappointment. This is what will happen: You will unzip the files in both 'Disc' folders. After that, you will mount the ISO in the Disc 1 folder. Then a messege will pop up saying,""Failed to identify the disc in the drive. Insert a licensed disc in the drive and retry the disc check."" (with Daemon Tools) or ""Enter a Disc Key for disc labelled ""F3_GOTY_D1"". Usually the key can be found on the facial side of the disc or in the product manual."" (with PowerISO).

So again, I urge you NOT to download this torrent."
[V],MAFIAA.,2011-03-28T12:08Z,"@Destoroyah

1. you are a moron
2. you are moron + you never downloaded scene...
3. you are bigger moron for being lazy twat and cant figure out how to install this game... also go buy the game its way to easier for you ;)

@all don't know how to unpack rar files or install scene games... give it up go buy the original game and stop downloading things you will only disappoint yourself. Also learn to read description.

With love from Stun ;) "
