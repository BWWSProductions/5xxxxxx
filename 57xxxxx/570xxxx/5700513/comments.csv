-All downloads seem to be in place
-Seeding at the moment so will check files when at 1/1 downloaded/seeded ratio
-I didn't download season 7 as I already have it

Will post a comment if downloads all work/fail"
,harryham1,2010-08-14T17:02Z,"typo. I meant i didn't download season 1.
Annoying proof logo on there from some website (americanxdad i think). Does annoy alot, but other than that. I would seed more but my firewall is a pain in the ass, my internet is slow, and I have a million and one things I want to download. I haven't tested all downloads. Someone please download, comment, and seed as i feel like the only one here"
