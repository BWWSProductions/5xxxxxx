"95% of All PCs Have Hidden Errors on Them! Let Us Scan Your PC and Discover How Many Errors Are Lurking Inside It..."

Keep your PC operating smoothly by using Error Repair Professional to identify and repair hidden errors inside your PC. With only a single click, it will scan your PC for any invalid registry entries and provides a list of the hidden errors found. You can then choose to selectively clean each item or automatically repair them all. 

This is yet another basic Windows Registry repair tool in an already crowded field, but the demo lacks an important feature. Error Repair Professional's function list and results display window is quickly mastered by any level user. You can click a single button for a full system scan, or perform individual item scans as easily. The latter gives a detailed display of the error entries.

Error Repair Professional's comprehensive scan checks Windows Startup entries, unneeded uninstall entries, unused file extensions, improperly listed ActiveX and DLL entries, cookies, history files, and temporary entries. If the scans are not lightening quick, they are at least steady. A full scan churns through in an average time as progress is displayed with the number of errors discovered. However, our testers found that some Windows Startup programs were incorrectly reported as errors. The items are easily unchecked against deletion, but there is no method to protect such items against future scans.

After finding all errors, this demo does nothing. Repairing errors is disabled until the program is purchased. Users are unable to accurately measure the program without a chance to test repair ability and speed. Users of any experience level will find Error Repair Professional easy to operate, but it falls short of similar programs in speed and configurability.
