JMC - GONNABE + BONUS (2008)

27 Jun 2008, 15:35
JMC - GONNABE + BONUS shows the transition from Jason M. Cox (former name) to Jason M. Christos. The general idea is the first tracks are older and towards the end of the album it shows the rebirth of JMC. The main idea is grey because it is a transition and these tracks were recorded over a seven year period. The BONUS material is every track I could find (RIP to the lost tracks) that was not released on JMC - GONNABE (2007). So the main idea of these tracks and the order in which they are played is a transition from the death of the old JMC to the birth of the new JMC The climax being PlayDIED IN YOUR ARMS which marks the death of Jason M. Cox and the birth of Jason M. Christos.
