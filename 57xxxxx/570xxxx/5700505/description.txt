Vhs transfer to dvd. 2.84GB Mpeg2 vob files. Quality is pretty decent considering it's a transfer. Some IMDB info: Hosted by Nick and his demented zombie puppet Happy, they treat a theater full of zombies to 83 minutes of cool trailers from horror and gore flicks from 70's (mostly). Between trailers Nick & Happy tell some pretty lame jokes. Two things would've made this a little better. 1.Less of Nick and his annoying puppet 2.More obscure films Overall, its one of the best trailer tapes ive seen (and i've seen a few). 8/10 Here's a a few of the trailers on the tape - I Drink your Blood Deranged Three on a Meathook Love me Deadly Cannibal Girls Deep Red Toxic Zombies Black Christmas Blood and Lace Bay of Blood Ilsa Last House on the Left TCM Blood spattered Bride I Dismember Mama Torso Beyond the Door
