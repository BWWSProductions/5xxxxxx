,join4frreefun,2010-07-22T10:55Z,"Sorry for any trouble I caused, dydu. 
I posted your link to another torrent because they were asking for money from their fans, and I wanted to give them an alternative, since many of them believed there was none. 

I already told them I'd said my piece, and wouldn't post anymore (and I haven't) but instead of telling me to stop they seem to prefer to put the pressure on you. 
Again, sorry about that, you don't need that, and I hope you have no more trouble now. and I certainly won't do anything to cause that.

Keep up the good work!

All the best"
,join4frreefun,2010-07-26T19:03Z,"Sorry, I was mistaken. 'They' were asking with good reason, and I shouldn't have intruded. The more choice (and uploaders) we have, the better!

Apologies again,

Cheers
