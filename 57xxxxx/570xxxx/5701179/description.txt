Starting from an offshore oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico, Sanjayan looks at how the
abundance of the planet's energy fuels every aspect of life on Earth. From wind, water,
the sun, volcanoes and hurricanes, from the smallest cells to the tallest trees, Earth
has the natural energy to power the planet, but mankind is not using it. What can
humans learn from the creation of the natural world that will help create energy?
