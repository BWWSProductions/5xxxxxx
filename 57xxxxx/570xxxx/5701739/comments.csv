I will upload Psycho in a 5-6 hours since I couldn't up it before I left. 

I will upload maybe 2-4 more movies in the next 24 hours, if every goes as planned.

@ Pablo CC - I will do my best to fill your request. 

I have about 15-20 encodes I did over vacation, and I have more in the making. he he he.  So expect some more stuff soon."
