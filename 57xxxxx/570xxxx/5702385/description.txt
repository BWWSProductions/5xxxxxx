In Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, Annie Oakley used a mirror to shoot a rifle over her
shoulder. William Tell shot an apple off his son's head with a crossbow. Whether it's the
Romans shooting flaming arrows or Barbarians slinging stones, history is filled with
legendary tales of amazing marksmanship. Now, HISTORY is tapping into these inspiring
feats of sharp-shooting for it's first-ever competition series and one contestant will
emerge with a $100,000 prize package and the title of "Top Shot".
