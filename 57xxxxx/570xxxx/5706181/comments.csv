,sunbleached,2010-07-21T06:41Z,is the audio in sync
,XoLWoX,2010-07-21T07:44Z,yes its the same as the others
,sunbleached,2010-07-21T07:53Z,"comments on ""the others"" say that the audio is out of sync, especially near the end. I apologize, but I'm not sure how to interpret your answer.... is it ""yes the audio is in sync"" or ""yes the audio is like the others, ie out of sync""

once again my apologies for being dense"
,sunbleached,2010-07-21T08:48Z,"Never mind - I got the sample, audio is out of sync."
,torenz,2010-07-21T15:47Z,why are ther so many out of sync.. and why bother uploading if they are.. pointless
