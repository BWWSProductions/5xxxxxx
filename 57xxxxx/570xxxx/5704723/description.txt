           At eighteen years old, Bezerra de Menezes leaves the           
           northeastern Brazil to                                         
           Rio de Janeiro in order to study in Medical School. At         
           this time, Rio was the capital of                              
           the Republic, and he was elected congressman in various        
           legislatures, becoming one                                     
           of the most prominent defenders of abolitionist ideas          
           and, ahead of his time, started                                
           to raise environmental debates.                                
           But what brings him greatest recognition was his               
           anonymous work on behalf of the                                
           needed. Being known lovingly as the ''Doctor of the            
           Poor''.                                                        
           Whether as a politician devoted to humanitarian causes or      
           a physician known for                                          
           never denying relief to those who knocked on his door,         
           Bezerra de Menezes becomes                                     
           an important spiritual leader and remains alive in the         
           hearts of millions of Brazilians. A                            
           life history marked by fraternal love and charity.             
           Bezerra is also known as the Brazilian.
