...................................NFO:....................................

.Hello Scene GentleMen and Women


Today we bring you an interesting nfo.

So as we all know fax aka Bukkake aka Milk (HES CURRENTLY KNOWN AS G4) loves to NFO sites and threaten the siteops. BE AWARE ANYTHING BY THIS CANADIAN IS ALL LIES.

Fax is the leader of BiOSHOCK and HaZMaT, HaZMaT loves to include fake info about sites in their nfos and aswell bashing other groups and curries, please be aware this group is banned on most top sites.

Okay with that being cleared off the way.


This scene notice is about the Satcon AKA satcom danish racer from the group PATH

This guy is supporting fax and BiRD in his quest to nfo sites and threaten the sites.

We're aware Satcon has been flaming most scene groups forever, And I wonder to myself why do sites still let him race their sites? the scene isnt about flaming other groups or sites or even curries

So anyways I decided since I knew fax's link it was time to try a trick, I waited for hours till his bnc died and took over for a few mins

in that time I pm'd Satcon and guess what......the epicness happened I mean I jizzed in my pants.

**P.S: You people can verify Satcon is always dissing other groups in public chan, Not only that but he aswell loves to say bad info on the respected curries




OMFG, CAN YOU GUYS BELIEVE IT....THE 2 WERE PART OF THE NFO FEW MONTHS AGO THAT RESULTED IN AFFILS/UDBs EXPOSED thanks to these insecure fagg0ts

I dont condone what those siteops did, putting the affils and UDB in as public NFO is a serious problem.
