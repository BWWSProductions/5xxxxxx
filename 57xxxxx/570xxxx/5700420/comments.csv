,lunabreed,2010-07-20T18:39Z,"When I try to extract the iso winrar tells me that there are archives missing, more specific, it tells me that the archive I've highlighted and extracting is missing, what do I do?"

So:
nnn-spatorrent-com (1).r00 --> nnn-spatorrent-com.r00
nnn-spatorrent-com (2).r01 --> nnn-spatorrent-com.r01
etc."
