SPECIAL NOTE: To get updates from me on the capturing, editing, and compression process of the torrents, you can get more information by visiting a Twitter page I created atI created this so that you will all have a good idea on when to expect the torrents in the coming weeks.

TORRENT NOTE: This video has been edited with no commercials and covers the entire race live, no highlights. Part 1, Part 2, & Part 3 are separate files so that you can download Part 1 first to watch the race while you are downloading Part 2 & 3. All coverage is live and none of the race was removed during the commercial removal process. Enjoy.
