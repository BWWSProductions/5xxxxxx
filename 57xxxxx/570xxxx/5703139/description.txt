The year is 1944. Along Normandy's shores, Jerome, a world-weary lord, and Marie, his ravishing but bored wife, live in rustic tranquility. Unexpectedly, their world is turned upside down when a German outfit bivouacs themselves in their ramshackle chateau. Soon, Marie finds herself being pursued by both the German commanding officer and a French spy working covertly to plan the D-Day attacks. With so many men vying for her affection, what's a married girl to do?
