ThunderBum - wow...sounds like a painful experience w/kidney stones. Flush 'em out with beer if you're brave...lol!


Shut-Up Maria! "
,thunderbum,2010-07-23T23:23Z,"Tainan - brutal! Got a few different meds: Demerol (quite nice actually, took 2 to start with and floated away for a few hours), one was an NSAID to deal with inflammation (from kidneys to urethra making it easier to pass the stone if it was going to pass), one for my prostate to temporarily shrink the prostate and help the 'flow' when I have to 'go'.

Beer? Sounds like a great idea actually. Never thought of that. LOL!! That would be a nice chaser to the Demerol 

Had an appointment with the renal surgeon, a follow-up x-ray, and the stone seems to have passed.

Gives me a new script for sodium bicarbonate. Yup. baking soda. I asked if I couldn't just swig a tsp of bs in a glass of water twice a day instead? (Much cheaper). Gives me a song and dance about the identical doses every time, blah blah blah.... so I got the capsules. Lazy.

This is like the 3rd or 4th go-round with this.  But I'm out of Demerol, and beer is helping me: vitamins going in... helping the flow going out! LOL!!
