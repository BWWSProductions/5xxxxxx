apologies to my loyal crew who always down load UKTVUK & WOBF torrents from me-ive been trying now for 6 weeks to correct 2 problems relating to capatcha & the "your password is too old" message upon attempting to sign in

HAVE TO SAY SUPRBAY IS THE WORST FORUM I HAVE EVER SEEN-IT IS DESPICABLE THE WAY THESE CRETINS GET A GOD COMPLEX & BAN PEOPLE FOR ASKING A QUESTION.I was banned for not reading 900 pages of rules & regs(show me any1 who has)& posting a question!!!!
Fact is they know the thing dont work & they dont like bein told anythin -so after the bill has finished its run im stoppin all torrents-i will redirect all my regulars to 3 great sites iv started using as a downloader.

This weeks episode
Callum & kirsty answer a call,an eldery lady has seemingly been burgled & even worse........CID have a problem in that the elderly witness is not willing to have a medical examination to proove what happened & who was responsible -suspicion falls on a neighbour,kirstys time to step up & show what shes got as she tries to help the lady come to terms & also get that exam & conviction
