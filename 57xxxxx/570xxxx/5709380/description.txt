PANIC IN THE JUNGLE 
Dave and Cody tackle a lost hiker scenario in the sweltering jungles of Laos. For their journey, the only "tools" they have are items a backpacker might carry: a 35 mm camera, condoms and a pack of cigarettes. They bushwhack their way through dense terrain, but the survival experts find themselves at odds over the best way to hydrate themselves. Dave drinks from a creek he believes to be safe from parasites, while Cody relies on hydration from the stalks of wild banana palm. The two eventually come to a wide river they believe is the way to help. But to travel the river, they must first join forces to lash together a homemade raft with bamboo and Lao vines.
