By 2512 the Catholic Vatican (Vatican Ouest) had been moved to Colorado. The center of religious power was an immense and sprawling series of interconnected towers that were perpetually made larger and larger. Brilliant but troubled, Eppy Thatcher grew up in a religious household, and was subject to continued abuse due to his mother's beliefs. Eppy would grow up to see the church as a symbol for greed and corruption, and adopting the mantle of Grendle, now the church's symbol of the devil, he sought to bring down the dominance of Pope Innocent XLII. Pope Innocent was a the new identity of Tujiro XIV who had ascended the church's ranks at some point during the church's rise to power.
