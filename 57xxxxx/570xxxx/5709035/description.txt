The Oscar-winning film "Slumdog Millionaire" put India's largest slum, Dharavi, on the
map. Much more than a slum, this mini-city bustles with industry, culture and dreams.
See the day-to-day activities and hear real-life accounts from its inhabitants, who have
goals and aspirations -- people who are struggling to survive in a community that defies
expectation.
