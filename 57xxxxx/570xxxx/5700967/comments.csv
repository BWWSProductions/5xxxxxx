So you'll have to work out the time differences for your locations. By the way HD versions are usually shown at the very same time on BBC HD 1.
Obviously this takes more time to convert and upload, so as soon as you see the SD versions appear here the HD versions wont be too far behind.

Thanks for the up Dean!"
