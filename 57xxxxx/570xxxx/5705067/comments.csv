,trymeoutimhot,2010-07-20T22:17Z,"let?s be clear: Inception is a reasonably easy movie to understand?

BUT POORLY DONE
Most people will be wowed by teh film cause of its context narrative, but once you peel off the onion layer, its still an onion. 
this is what happens when you have been force fed shitty films for a long time, and then shown an Average film, you tend to think its golden syrup"
