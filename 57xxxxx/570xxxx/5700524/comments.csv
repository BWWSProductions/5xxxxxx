,Fortesting1,2010-08-07T22:36Z,"Hello, how do you do?

Could you seed this torrent? Because everybory is stuck at 96.8 %... Thank you very much!"

Romania rulz ;)"
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-09-09T09:20Z,"I've stopped the upload for 3-5 minutes, to let you share between yourselves all that I've been giving, and I'll come back :) do not worry

here I found the missing 3,4 % :

it is the same stuff only by other name...cause MSDN and Technet both are Microsoft sites... so to preseed from one location to another you have to stop the torrent cut the iso to the other location rename it as MSDN wants... make a recheck/rehash... start the torrent ...till reaches 100% stop it again...come back with it ...rename it as Technet wants...as it is in this torrent...and rehash , start , and voila !! ;) I was looking at you from the last days... I thought there must be a solution for you ;)))  "
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-09-09T09:24Z,"obviously between Technet and MSDN there is the same hash...the same ISO only names differ
the client it checks the torrent by the name and hash... si changing the name from one to another it still keeps the content untouched ;)) 
MS could not permit to offer something to MSDN and something else to Technet ..it's the same deal.."
