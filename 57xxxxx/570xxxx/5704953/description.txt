   Section-E was formed in January of 2001 with the idea of having    
   a release group that focused entirely on electronica videos and    
   only on electronica videos, rather then being the typical group    
   that tries to cover all genres.                                    
                                                                      
   The reality is now, that in order to release high quality stuff    
   one cannot use most of dvb sources, cause they don't offer much    
   overquality (especially now when labels are uploading    
   high quality videos there themselves).                             
                                                                      
   That is why, if you can get sources directly from Armada or any    
   other label, that decided  to actually promote their artists by    
   filming music videos and you are reading this NFO, then contact    
   us at:
