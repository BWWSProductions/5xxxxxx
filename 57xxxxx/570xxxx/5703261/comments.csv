,MadcapN,2010-07-22T01:54Z,"This is a classic album and I was thrilled to see it uploaded. Thank you. However, it distorts on the high end quite a bit. I listened to a couple of tracks back to back with the CD and the CD is clearer, has a wider, distinct dynamic range and is 'warmer' than this lossless vinyl upload! Is it the quality of the of the vinyl or the equipment? The entire thing just sounds like the levels were way too hot. : (  "
