Tourist & Trekking  Map of Rodna / Rodnei Mountains in Romania.
Published by BelAlpin in 2006. Hard to find even in Romania.

Probably the most up to date map of these mountains. I used it during my trip in 2009. Very beautiful landscape with few tourists and clear paths. 

Very high quality scan (my backup) converted to jpeg. You should probably crop the parts you need, it's one very big image :)

Resolution: 11649 x 8104

Enjoy!
