,Ariask,2011-10-10T13:13Z,How is it possible for 26 files to be 7gigs? Why do people on this site download big ass files.
,SpiderLess,2011-10-15T18:15Z,its a big file because its in 720p HD 
,zcs0213,2012-01-05T07:30Z,remove the english sub from the title cus its total crap it doesn't have subs at all... the quality is great and it torrents fast... but no subs... what a shame
