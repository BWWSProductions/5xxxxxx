,djME27,2010-08-09T19:25Z,"Erm... my mouse isn't reacting in-game, so something has gotta be wrong on my end.  Unless I am expected to somehow control the crosshairs via the keyboard, which I doubt since that is most likely impossible (at least I hope so; certainly would suck).  There don't seem to be any key maps or controls in the game options either... my guess is because this was a port from a console version... maybe MAME?  If I am missing something here, or if I am the only one with the problem, please let me know.  Got a wireless Microsoft IntelliMouse Explorer."
