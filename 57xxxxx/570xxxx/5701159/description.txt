In the first episode, The Energy Revolution, Sanjayan explores the beginnings of a shift
in energy use that will change the world. Whether for national security, the economy or
the health of our planet, there are as many drivers for change as there are technologies
vying for a top spot. The hope is for a silver bullet to solve the problem all at once;
the reality is that mankind is looking at the next industrial revolution, requiring the
greatest minds and all the creativity we can harness. The episode looks at cutting edge
technologies that could allow us to break our dependence on fossil fuels.
