Cheers for the understanding."

,warrior_X,2010-07-31T07:38Z,So how can we get this Office to install. It won't install without a valid key.
,lohung,2010-08-04T16:46Z,"I am sorry but what is the difference between the Volume and the Technet you posted prathaprabhu? And also is this a full copy final release from Microsoft, not a 30 day trial?  Thanks for your help"
[T],prathaprabhu,2010-08-14T19:56Z,"@ lohung

Volume = As far as the features as concern everything is same but requires MAK key or can be used with KMS Local Activator or Loader or can be run about 180days without activation.

Retail = Requires a valid key to install and should be activated in 30 days time."
