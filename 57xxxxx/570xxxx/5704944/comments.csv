,tant_d_walf_mama,2010-12-28T05:10Z,"Hi MKVGuy, just watched this the other night and really liked it, more than just an action flick.

I'd say Logan's Run+Brazil+a little eXistenZ(weird that it was Jude in that one too) and a dash of the Tell-tale Heart.

And the title is actually Repo Men. Might help in the searches  ;)

Repo Man would be a good one to load though. Haven't seen it since it first came out, might have to check it out again."
