              Release Date....: 2010.07.22
              Genre...........: Documentary

       Documentary following the mums and dads who believe that their 
       child's birthday party is the most important day of the year. 
       These lavish events take months to plan, are exhausting to pull 
       off and cost a fortune, but they can also cause tension amongst 
       the other parents who struggle to keep up with these 
       sophisticated shindigs.
       
       In this film we meet four families who each have their own unique 
       reasons for holding such elaborate functions - an 8-year-old boy 
       who is throwing a cowboy themed party; a girl's winter wonderland 
       party featuring meerkats, unicorns and reindeer; a superhero 
       extravaganza; and the most spectacular of the lot - a bar mitzvah 
       held at a five star hotel.
       
       It's not just the scale and decadence of these parties that's 
       surprising, we also hear some fascinating anecdotes from the 
       parents, the party planners, the entertainers and the kids about 
       why massive birthday parties are becoming increasingly popular.
       
       An awe-inspiring yet heart-warming film which questions whether 
       spoiling and indulging our kids is such a bad thing after all.
