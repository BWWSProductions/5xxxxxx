         Only a handful of people have ever had the chance to see      
         the Five Chambers high above the Grand Gallery of the Great   
         Pyramid. Now, Zahi decides to go on his final journey to      
         the Five Chambers with the fellows in tow...together they     
         will document the ancient graffiti on the walls of the        
         Chambers, proving Zahi's theory that ancient Egyptians,       
         not slaves, built the Pyramids at Giza. This near-death       
         experience leaves the fellows; Leslie, the executive          
         producer; and, the crew gasping for air. Finally, Zahi will   
          reveal his findings in an exclusive television interview.
