A quick google search directly turned me back to these particular torrents so I got no real explanation... and I don't understand why you stated that you're ""no longer seeding"" the ""Immersed"" version, but the ""Proper"". And then, I find this one with only ""FQM"".  

You're a big help every Sunday night, and thank you for any information.  "

When I did I noticed a program called Antivir Solutions Pro was attempting to scan my computer. I've dealt with rouge virus programs before so I didn't have too much of an issue. Now I see everyone else here seemed to download the torrent fine, and maybe I picked it up from somewhere else, but I'm just warning others of what happened to my computer after downloading this torrent. Rouge antivirus programs make it impossible to open any programs on your computer, thus making it impossible to remove if you don't already know how."
