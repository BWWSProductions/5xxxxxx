Ajay Devgn is SP Amit Kumar, who is given charge of the Tejpur District in Bihar. The area is full of crime, including those committed by the local police. Gradually Amit realises that the local politician Sadhu Yadav is the one who benefits the most out of it.
Amit arrests Sunder Yadav, Sadhu's son. While Sunder is released soon, some police officers, get frustrated with the system, and pour acid into the eyes of two of Yadav's men, blinding them. A hue and cry is raised by the media, crime almost comes to a standstill, and the police are regarded with respect.
The film contains the picture of a typical police and political cum criminal systems in India. The film contains many derogatory phrases (abusive language) which are typical to hear from police and criminals alike in most of the north Indian state. Notwithstanding with the negative picture depicted in the movie, this is probably the best screen performance by actor Ajay Devgn as Superintendent of police of Tejpur.
The feature-film depicts the life of a common Indian men, common Indian women, common Indian teenager, common Indian press, common Indian policemen, common Indian businessmen, common Indian politicians who very often are linked to common Indian criminals who take away the right of a common man to live a common life.
