Quality was a little on the poor side, an enthusiastic audience laughs along and someone's head pops up on the side now and again, plus it seemed like a short segment (5min?) was cut out before the end?  As mentioned in the description, poor crop so you can't always see what is happening on the edges of the screen.  Not unwatchable, though."
