,acr250rider,2010-07-25T22:47Z,Should lose your ass for these encoded downloads! Why the hell would you encode this junk? Seems like a waste of time !
,acr250rider,2010-07-25T22:50Z,He should lose his ass with these damn encoded videos! Why the hell would you even encode this junk? What a complete waste of time! Safcock sucks ass!
,P_W_W,2010-07-26T01:23Z,"@acr250rider
What do you mean when you bark that somebody should ""lose his ass""? Probably a self made expression to hide lack of knowledge when it comes to encoding..."

,Boralucifin,2010-07-26T18:37Z,The sound isnt really that good and the picture is dark in some places but so far the best iv seen.
,jonfuckoff,2010-07-26T18:47Z,"@acr250rider

I believe SAFCuk009 encodes this so called ""junk""for us all, so we dont have to download/waste 1.34 GB of bandwidth if the films is shit.  Plus he makes em look a hell of alot better!

Now that u have ur answer, run along u moron... "

,Sinister181,2010-07-27T16:23Z,"It's so dark, you can't even see what's going on in most places. The Audio is good, however. I just wish there was a way to make it brighter and less blurry."

,torntnoob,2010-07-29T05:33Z,I was wondering (if it's even possible) if anyone knows how to turn a downloaded torrent into a dvd that you could play in a dvd player or xbox or something.
