Slipway Fires is the third album by English rock band Razorlight. The album was released on November 3, 2008. It received generally negative reviews - Drowned In Sound described it as "a headachey throb of over-production and excessive sentiment" and "about as indie as Margaret Thatcher", while the NME described them as "just a boringly competent indie band masquerading as, at best, Fleetwood Mac and, at worst, Whitesnake". Q were favourable however, commenting that "Slipway Fires requires more of your time and duly rewards it", as well as making it their album of the month.
The first single from the album, Wire to Wire, was released on 26 September 2008. It was premiered by Zane Lowe on BBC Radio 1 on 8 September 2008, and peaked at number 5 in the UK Singles Chart.
The second single taken from the album is Hostage of Love released on 12 January 2009.
