Product Description
Godspeed: The Kurt Cobain Graphic takes Cobain s story and plays it out as a totally unique graphic novel. From the luminous colors of an idyllic childhood through the flamboyant hues of success and stardom, Cobain s story inevitably declines into a much darker palette. The script draws from the singer s tortured self-image as well as straightforward biographical fact so that the tone of the book fluctuates between subjective dream-state and objective reality. Going beyond the facts, it transmutes Cobain s extraordinary life into an equally extraordinary work of art. In full color throughout with amazing artwork by Flameboy.
