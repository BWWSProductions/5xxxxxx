Good comments welcome, bad comments welcome, just as long as you say something about the torrent.  I need to know if there is anyone interested in possibly more of a similar nature to be made available or if I am just wasting my time."
,Stultissimi_Amatorii,2010-09-17T03:30Z,"Thanks, T-Wolf. This was one I was looking for a couple months ago. Would you have more Gowan? Like CdeB, some of his best stuff was never released as singles."
,T-Wolf,2010-09-22T05:54Z,"  Sorry, this was the only one on CD.  Everything else is on cassette.  
  What you are looking for has got to be out there somewhere, I'm sure of it.
  Thnx for your comment. :)
Woof!"
