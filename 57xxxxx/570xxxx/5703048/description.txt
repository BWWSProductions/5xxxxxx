IMAGiNE NOTES
Ok where do we start with this one :hmmm: well firstly thanks to the upper / capper on Relizlab for the video.
The audio was our own off our TS.
Now got to be totally honest with you and say we are unsure WHAT this actually is ... video wise. The detail on it looks like a screener, but then now and again you see a border on the left side appear and then disappear and also on the end credits you can see a pulse on the yellow background ... which neither of then some be one a screener but are more often or not found on cams ...
Anyway we've tagged it how the source we used was which was a 5.20gig 720p mp4 file so ...

Well work done for this we fixed the AR because it was slightly off and made a script tweaking the colours, brightness, contrast etc slightly and also we've resized it to 720 x down from 1280 x
The audio was ok but lacked bass so dropped it in goldwave and added some more bass to it, to give it some depth. Once done it was a case of syncing it, which was a bitch to do ... some major jumps in the audio gaps, ranging from 500 - 11700ms. So we did our best and we've scrolled through and didn't see any oos parts,but if there is ... hey sorry.

Anyway retail should be out soon but until then, enjoy :)

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
