[T],Robston,2010-07-22T10:56Z,"Bodyline is an Australian 1984 television miniseries which dramatised the events of the 1932?1933 English Ashes cricket tour of Australia.

Played in Australia, the series gained notoriety in Australian and worldwide cricketing history for the fact that the English team (headed by captain Douglas Jardine) applied a bowling technique called ""leg theory"", or more commonly, Bodyline.  The series generated much anger and resentment towards the English team within Australia and seriously damaged Anglo-Australian cricketing relations at the time.
