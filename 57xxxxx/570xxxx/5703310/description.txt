CINEMA is the bands first studio release since 2007.  

The album is due for release June 25 in Australia, June 29 in Canada, July 6 in the USA, and about a month later in Europe and everywhere else.

Produced by Steve Schram, and recorded at Sing Sing Studios in the bands home town of Melbourne, this is an album which shows The Cat Empire at their very best, right now. 

In an age when so much of selling music seems to be about celebrity and fashion, The Cat Empire have risen to be one of Australia and indeed the worlds favourite live acts through sheer musicality and the power of their interaction on stage. 

2010 sees the international release and world tour of Cinema, the band's fourth studio album.  The album serves up a set which captures the inexorable force - and sheer joy - of their live performances, delivered in a format perfect for lounge-rooms, backyards, BBQ's, cafes, road trips and parties all over the world.  This is music which defies definition, but has a sound all of its own.  

The only thing we can tell you it is that it is incredibly infectious, undeniably uplifting and definitely danceable.
