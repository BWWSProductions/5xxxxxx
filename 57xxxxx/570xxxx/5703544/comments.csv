,runil,2010-07-20T17:05Z,What kind of person uploads a torrent and then drops off w/o seeding it?  Makes no sense whatsoever!
,runil,2010-07-20T19:09Z,Wasn't familiar with this so looked it up.  Famous for being the worst thing written ever!  CAUTION: If you like Potterverse and you read or hear this you'll wish you could turn time back and unread it. Or have your brain sucked out.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

,zaurez,2010-07-20T19:16Z,"Known as the worst fanfic ever, loosely based on Harry Potter. Originally posted on fanfiction.net

Warning: brains might melt after being exposed to this shit."
,Natalie668,2010-09-14T16:19Z,"This is the shittest fanfiction I have attempted to read in a long time. 
The fact that anyone would take the time to read it out loud and post it on here is beyond me. 
Don't download it. It's dubbed the worst Fanfiction of all time. "
