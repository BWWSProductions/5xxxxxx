,j-d-uk,2010-07-19T13:51Z,"For all you guys out side of the UK, Top Gear first usually airs here on BBC Two at 8:00pm and always on Sunday evenings.
So you'll have to work out the time differences for your locations. By the way HD versions are usually shown at the very same time on BBC HD 1.
Obviously this takes more time to convert and upload, so as soon as you see the SD versions appear here the HD versions wont be too far behind.

Thanks for the up eztv team!"
