Elsa and Clive, two young rebellious scientists, defy legal and ethical boundaries and

create a new organism. Named ""Dren"", the creature rapidly develops from a deformed
female infant into a beautiful but dangerous winged human-chimera, who forges a bond
with both of her creators - only to have that bond turn deadly
