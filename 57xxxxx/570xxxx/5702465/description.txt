From Wiki:

Flashforward is a science fiction novel by Canadian author Robert J. Sawyer first published in 1999. The novel is set in a fictionalized year 2009. At CERN, the Large Hadron Collider accelerator is performing a run to search for the Higgs boson. The experiment has a unique side effect: the entire human race loses consciousness for about two minutes. During that time, nearly everyone sees themselves in the future (by about 21 years). Each individual experiences their own future through the senses of their future self.

The novel inspired the 2009 television series FlashForward.
