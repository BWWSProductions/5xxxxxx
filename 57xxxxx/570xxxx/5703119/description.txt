The Orb - Peel Sessions - 25 January 1997(#1)

Recorded off air to a stand alone minidisc on the night of broadcast. Transfered to .wav recently using the same player plugged with optic directly into my sound card and recorded using audiograbber.

I have not trimmed the recordings, and for Peel fans there are some lovely comments at the start and end of these recordings that you will enjoy as John inadvertantly becomes part of the track at one point.

There were apparently 3 tracks played that evening. I can't remember which the other was, but i never recorded it. Probably one of the tunes I don't like. I've realised that no one has seems to have these. They've never been released for some resaon, and no-one ever seems to share them either. So here, maybe for the first time, are 2 tracks from The Orbs 3rd and final Peel Session.
