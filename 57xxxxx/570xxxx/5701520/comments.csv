,Sanvirel,2010-07-19T08:16Z,thanks but could you at least add a cover picture?
,Sanvirel,2010-07-19T08:35Z,although the walls are nice they don't fit my screen resolution
,HDAbstractWallpapers.com,2010-07-19T08:41Z,@Sanvirel - I don't really get what you mean... where and in what way would you like to see a cover picture? If you want to see what you'll be downloading ahead of time check out the link to our site provided in the description and stop by the Gallery. Also the files in the torrent are not bundled in anyway so you can just download a few if you want some samples.
,HDAbstractWallpapers.com,2010-07-19T08:52Z,"@Sanvirel - Previously the wallpapers were being created at 1680x1050, and then just recently all new ones at 1920x1080 as that is more standard. It would be nice to have them in multiple resolutions but that would probably be rather difficult to accomplish unless the lower resolutions are simply just shrunken down afterward."
,Sanvirel,2010-07-19T08:57Z,i did visit your site and the one i liked from your site wasn't in this set you have uploaded here. as far  a cover picture. just upload a pic to BayImg and select the setting to resize for tpb (torrent image ) just use the 9 letters after the http part that bayimg provides on the torrent upload page 
,HDAbstractWallpapers.com,2010-07-19T09:09Z,"@Sanvirel - I added the cover image, Thanks I didn't even know that option was there. And the other wallpapers your talking about are from the July 2010 album which won't be uploaded via torrents until the end of the month as it will be added to throughout the month. In the meantime, if you go to the wallpaper on the site and click the ""full size"" link you can just save the image from there."
,Sanvirel,2010-07-19T09:13Z,with the cover pic you'll now get more hits on this torrent too :).... i change my walls about every 2-3 weeks and will tell my friends about your website keep up the good work :)
,HDAbstractWallpapers.com,2010-07-19T09:44Z,@Sanvirel - Thanks :)
