Phantom Planet is the third album by the rock band Phantom Planet, released on January 6, 2004. The album marked a startling change in the band's sound, shifting from radio-friendly pop rock to garage rock, comparable to the sound of The Strokes.

During the recording of the album, drummer and co-founder Jason Schwartzman left the band to pursue his acting career.

The song "By the Bed" is about Alex's grandmother, and what she told him on her deathbed.

The music video for album's single, "Big Brat," had significant airplay beginning in December 2003. It cuts between scenes of an urban performance of the song to the band shooting a low budget zombie film in the relative location.

The actual zombie film being shot was used as an alternate music video for the song available to fans on the bands website
