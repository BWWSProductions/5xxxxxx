Basic Description:

Press the button and get a million dollars, but someone whom you don't know will die.  This is the offer given to Norma and Arthur, an ordinary decent couple played by Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, by the mysterious Arlington Steward (Frank Langella).  The question "What would you do?" will ring in your ears as you witness that their decision is just the beginning.  Based on a short story by the writer of I AM LEGEND and from the director of DONNIE DARKO, The Box takes you on a tense, gripping and totally unpredictable ride as the couple realise that they are part of something greater and far more terrifying than they could ever have imagined.

Hope you enjoy !
