[V],twentyforty,2010-07-28T11:33Z,"@drs1982: You have virus moron - sized as empty space between your ears. MP4 cannot carry a virus, idiot."
,tpbdotorg64,2010-07-30T00:52Z,"Just leave pirate bay, 20-40. We don't need your insults. You've been throwing insults here and there. Trying to make other users look stupid. Other users don't know what you know about encoding, yet you treat them like sh!t. Calling them names when they ask a simple question. The rudest uploader ever. And, without shame, you ask users for money??? wtf! This is free. If you want people to give you money, go create your own private site. Oh I forgot, you're poor. You can't create your private site because you can't pay your internet bills, buy a pc, spend hours downloading sources and encoding, pay your phone bills, pay your electric bills, pay for your food...etc. I feel sorry for people who bought your cr@p. How stupid can they be, believing you're about to die due to cancer?! LMAO! I hope TPB will delete your account and ban your IP. 

Just leave and don't come back. Fed up with your conceitedness. I have never seen anyone who is as rude as you. What a douche...

do not delete this again."

@All New Guys
Please keep the torrents on, do not remove them after you are finished with download. Keep Ratio above 1:1. And dont worry your ISP donot charge you for the uploads. So help Others. sharing is Caring. God Bless "
