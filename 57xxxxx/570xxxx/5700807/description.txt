...................................NFO:.................................................The.Biography.Channel.Threes.Company.HDTV.XviD-MOMENTUM

What do you get when a bubbly blond, a practical brunette, 
and a clumsy bachelor all live under one roof? Three's 
Company -- the sexy sitcom that had audiences laughing 
(and swooning) throughout the late '70s and early '80s. 
But for the loveable roommates, the eight-year run wasn't 
all fun and games. We'll explore Three's Company's ups 
and downs--from topping the ratings chart to fighting on-set 
battles over paychecks, and from breaking down cultural 
boundaries to facing boycott threats from moral watchdogs.
