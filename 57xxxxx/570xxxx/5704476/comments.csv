,trentini,2010-08-09T18:22Z,"Não testei ainda o pacote, mas minha dúvida, aonde utilizo o arquivo activation.rar , já que nao tem nenhuma instrução junto com o arquivo. "
,christiangreer,2010-09-01T11:51Z,THANK YOU VERY MUCH
,Dandi1234,2010-11-23T22:13Z,"Estou usando um pc que formatei com esse DVD. Testado e aprovado XD

O processo de formatação demora muito mais. Se tiver todos os drivers em mãos fica muito mais rápido, mas esse pc aqui não tinha driver nenhum então fui testar logo nele. Funcionou certinho. Valeu =]"
,d0pp3Lgang3r,2011-01-06T04:59Z,"Você deveria explicar que no arquivo ""Ativacao.rar"" tem um trojan...

You should explain that there's a trojan inside the file ""Ativacao.rar""..."
,TiagoCabral,2011-01-16T10:02Z,"Infelizmente nÃ£o tive uma boa experiÃªncia com esse Windows. Gravei numa mÃ­dia boa, e ainda assim houveram vÃ¡rias falhas na instalaÃ§Ã£o, alÃ©m disso o driver da NVIDEA (GeForce) nÃ£o instalou por ser antigo de mais tendo que ser instalado manualmente como de costume.
AlÃ©m disso alguns recursos do Windows nÃ£o funcionaram devido as falhas na instalaÃ§Ã£o, tais quais os temas do windows, que inclusivem travam o computador se ativados, e o Windows INstaller nÃ£o permitindo que instalasse programas como o MS Office.
Instalei num Intel Pentium 4 com Motherboard Gigabyte, 512mb de ram, HD Sata de 80gb.
Tentei "

,marcoabc,2011-06-22T14:53Z,como posso gravar em um cd??
,NandoCamps,2011-07-20T21:40Z,"Cara!!! Muito obrigado por disponibilizar esta plataforma com tantas ferramentas inclusas. Fico muito feliz em não mais ter que me preocupar em usar o EVERST para poder abaixar os drivers. 
Muito obrigado."
,NandoCamps,2011-07-20T21:41Z,"você pode gravar usando o NERO, ou pelo utilitário ImgBurn."
,NandoCamps,2011-07-20T21:41Z,Use o ImgBurn para gravar as imagens.
,Iggy13,2011-07-30T04:45Z,"I know portuguese and I can tell you that the description of this torrent is irrelevant. Don't bother translating this.

In short, this is a WXP PRO SP3 with a lot of drivers pre-loaded in the installation dvd. But it seems that this is a portuguese version. Not sure if you can set it to english."
,Vacille,2011-07-31T00:34Z,Boa...vlw pela força
