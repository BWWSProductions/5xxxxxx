Seeed!"
,PwnzAll,2010-07-26T15:30Z,"Is there anything special you need to run the files with?
I'm using VLC and there are 5 parts to the movie, but only the first part has the commentary."
,PwnzAll,2010-07-26T17:45Z,"Alright, I figured it out.

For those that don't know, just download a .vob joiner and use that. It will join all the files to make it  one entire movie with the commentary through out like it was intended.
(probably works the same if you use a vob to dvd burner)


Movie was great, commentary was pretty good too. Worth the download if you enjoyed the movie, or The Runaways.
It is mainly Joan and Kristen talking the whole time. Generally on the background of the scenes.
Dakota doesn't talk as much as the other two, but it was nice to hear what she had to say.

Overall, it was very entertaining. I'll probably end up watching it a few more times.

Thanks for the upload."
