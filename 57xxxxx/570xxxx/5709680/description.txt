Notes: This release has no chinese subs, so no blur. All credit goes to ZJM, ive just added subs to the chinese speaking parts,  a few lines i can see do not have subs and sadly i don't speak chinese and i can't find the subs for it, but the main lines are covered, ENJOY.
Sorry to all my PA guys for the wait
