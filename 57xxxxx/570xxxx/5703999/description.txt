Here is a bunch of epubs that I have downloaded for my iPad, so I figured I might as well share them. They all have covers, and most of them are formatted correctly. One or two might be a bit quirky, but definately readable.

I put this up, because I found it hard to get a selection of books that I could just put onto my Ipad without worrying about covers and formatting.

Books Include:

Pride and Prejudice Jane Austen 
The Long Walk Stephen King 
The Running Man Stephen King 
Thinner Stephen King 
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Lyman Frank Baum 
The Bourne Supremacy 
Francis Scott Fitzgerald - The Great Gatsby.Ã¢
