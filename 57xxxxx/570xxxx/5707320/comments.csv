,Critic_101,2010-07-24T14:30Z,"Just F.Y.I when daddy and kick ass get beat live, at the part when kick starts to narrate and when they show his dad in the montage shot more than half the screen blacks out except for the dads eyes for a second. Both in this one and the earlier release, so both might be from same source different encoding coz both got the blackout at same time same frame. Thanx for the upload just letting u know coz u a perfectionist. Cheers!"
[V],poppedtart,2010-07-24T16:46Z,i noticed it as well.  the sources probably came from the same original source.  some sort of glitch in the source.  1080p bluray source avail soon anyhow.
