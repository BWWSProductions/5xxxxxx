Two packs of werewolves, divided by principles are signaled by the moon of the coming of an ancient prophecy. A small boy named Timothy approaches his 13th birthday, unaware this marks the time of his transformation. Timothy has been raised by his mother Rachel, his grandmother, his Uncle Jonas, his cousin Katherine and her boyfriend, Adam. Rachel and her son Timothy have been unaware that the rest of the family are good werewolves that have guarded Timothy since birth. They know that Timothy is a half blood, and will control the destiny of the family. But they also know that Timothy's power will put him in danger, for there are other werewolves that revel and embrace their blood-lust that are prepared to kill to preserve their way of life. These werewolves, led by Varek, Zo and Sonya, are hell bent on finding Timothy...their kin.
