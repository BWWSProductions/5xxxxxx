Thanos...Nova...Silver Surfer...Quasar...Gladiator...the cosmic heavy-hitters take the stage as Marvel?s latest sci-fi saga rockets onwards! A rival universe where life is the ultimate curse--and reality is determined by twisted, monolithic gods--is gouging into our own! Even the great abstract figures of creation like Oblivion and Eternity have taken up arms! What possible significance can Star-Lord and his band of misfit heroes hope to have? And how will the Mad Titan Thanos chose to take his stand? Find out here.

For some reason, I can't edit this torrent.

This is a higher quality version. It is 23MB and the old version is 5MB. It's sharper and brighter colors."
