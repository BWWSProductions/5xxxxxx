,payney1210,2010-07-20T19:02Z,A/6 V/7 very watchable and a quick download but one problem i did notice that the film is copied twice after you finish the first film it starts again but with no sound so i cant help thinking is this copy meant for an iphone/ipod or psp? but other than that it is still watchable in windows media player.

V = 7
A = 7 but A = 9 if u use DFX audio enhancer plug-in with windows media player or divx player."
