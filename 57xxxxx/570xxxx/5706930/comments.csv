But the English subtitles are terrible."
,difraxion,2010-10-03T05:44Z,You can find the god english subtitles of this movie on http://subscene.com/english/The-Housemaid-Hanyo/subtitle-362793.aspx
,Robo88,2010-11-02T10:54Z,english subtitle is hardcoded !
,cermek,2011-01-18T10:07Z,"I looked all screens, but dont see any hardcoded subs. Can anyone confirm please? It is have harcoded subs?"
,hauntnut,2011-02-04T01:23Z,"Just finished downloading and can confirm there are no hard-coded subs in the video, although as other comments have stated, the subs included with this release aren't the greatest, and those included in the link on the previous comment are much better. Aside from that, good audio and video! Thanks bunches!"
,NitneLiun,2011-03-05T17:03Z,How does one make the other subtitles appear in the video? I downloaded the .zip for those subtitles and unzipped but I still get the original bad subtitles.
,Undietaker,2011-06-18T08:35Z,If you rename the subs you downloaded to the exact same name as the movie torrent and drag it to the movie it will be added

,JRaiden,2012-03-16T17:39Z,"""The.Housemaid.2010.DVDRip.Xvid-XTM"" Seems like a bootleg or something (odd popup in beginning, small ""19"" logo every 10-20 minutes). Tiny resolution (170K pixels), with glitches, wrong AR (cropped?). Audio glitches, probably transcoded from very low bitrate. Subtitles NOT hardcoded, they're VobSub (IDX/SUB)... and horribly translated.

Subtitles: http://subscene.com/english/The-Housemaid-Hanyo/subtitle-552596.aspx"
