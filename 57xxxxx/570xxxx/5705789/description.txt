NGC takes viewers inside the doppelganger capital of India, whose population of 2,000
families contains more than 250 sets of twins - almost six times as many as the global 
average. While doctors try to explain and solve the mystery of this phenomenon through 
environmental and genetic testing, residents share their accounts of everyday life as 
a twin or within a family of twins.
