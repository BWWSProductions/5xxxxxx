Anopson, or instinctive, nutrition involves using one's senses to choose which foods to eat at a particular time. The choice is made among raw foods only (including raw meats) since cooked foods are not "natural" to man. Anopsologists believe that when a human eats food in its original state, the food's taste changes from pleasant to unpleasant once the person's need is fulfilled. Schaeffer describes the approach and alleges that it enables the body to cast off disease-causing toxins and allows good health to prevail. This interesting if not entirely convincing work is worth a look for the open-minded, but is not a necessary purchase for most libraries.
