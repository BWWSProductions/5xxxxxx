Keanu Reeves in one of his very first major parts as the 17-year old version of a man who wanted to become young again and had his wish come true. But his highschool sweetheart is now a mature widow, and a moving story emerges.

This made-for-TV movie has never been published on DVD except in Australia, where I accidentally found it in a kangaroo's pouch. Or perhaps it was in Dame Edna's very private collection. So there has never been another torrent for it. However, this so-called DVD looks like a bootleg transfer from VHS or laserdisc, so its quality is not exactly great. For this reason, I did not call this a 'DVDrip' although it technically is.

So the rip is not perfect, but it may be your only chance to see this rare film. 

Widescreen 624x384, original mono sound.
Runs well in both my standalone DivX players.

Several movies with similar themes were launched a few years afterwards:

Vice Versa (1988)

18 again (1988)

and of course Big (1988)with Tom Hanks.
