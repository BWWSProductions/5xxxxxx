,haftman,2010-07-19T13:28Z,"It does, and I've been able to get sound on the other episodes of entourage (.mkv files). I don't get it. I can see the video, but no sound"
,haftman,2010-07-19T13:38Z,Got it to work. Downloaded http://ffdshow-tryout.sourceforge.net/ and that did the trick. Strange that all other mkv's I have worked fine.
