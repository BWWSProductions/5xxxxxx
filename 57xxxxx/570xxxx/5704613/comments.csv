,lordimotep,2010-07-20T18:42Z,"tomytig, this is not right what ur saying
all these files are 100% guaranteed virus free

1. if you worry about a virus in the actual zip file scan it with an antivirus program

2. if you worry about a bad fake ROM that will ruin your console check it with a rom manager such as RToolDS, it checks the checksum of the file and so knows if it's real or not"
