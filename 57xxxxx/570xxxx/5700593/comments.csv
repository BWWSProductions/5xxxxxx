Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Looking for Inception too.  Can you work your Raymondhome magic on that flic?  If not...much appreciated anyway.

,AnitialD,2010-07-19T15:31Z,"Thanks Raymond as always. Better quality than last upload. V=9 A=9(kinda low), just needs subs for non-eng parts like he said."
,osustudent,2010-07-19T20:12Z,"This vid is legit. Good quality and everything. Only prob is no subs for the non-English parts. However......

Here is the Subtitles for the DVD:

Only prob is that this is English subs for everything...English and Non-English parts."
,sherriff89,2010-07-19T23:10Z,"Anyone else actually watch this the whole way through? Great video/audio - EXCEPT for the last 10 minutes theres no speech audio (All my settings are on stereo n such) I sadly had to turn it off and didnt end up watching the end, such a disappointment. Otherwise it was a great release except for the end :S"
,bremerton1,2010-07-19T23:31Z,Looks like Dkoots subs are legit. If they are out of sync use VLC. You can adjust it in VLC's menu... Tools - Track Synchronization - Advance of subtitles over video.

,highlander777,2010-07-21T03:26Z,There are so many plot holes in this movie it's not funny. And Jackie Chan is just going through the motions like he's being forcced to do this. Let's not even talk about the non-acting.

,Karnich99,2010-07-22T00:37Z,is this movie edited like the other uploads?   where they have removed screens duo to it being a chinese release?
,Karnich99,2010-07-22T00:40Z,is this the full length movie or the edited chinese version?
,AnitialD,2010-07-22T01:00Z,"@khaled_br...to watch with subs rename the .srt the same as the movie, put them in same folder, done.

@Karnich99....Yeah about 13min missing"
,Karnich99,2010-07-22T01:05Z,no full version out yet?
,AnitialD,2010-07-22T01:21Z,@Karnich99....good ? well according to other people its missing scenes bcuz its the Chinese version and runtime is sposed 2b 140min and this version is 127. I looked at other sites and some say 140 and others say 127 is the actual runtime I dont know if 140 is just the theatre time for trailers and such. I can't confirm cuz I didnt see it at the movies any1 else?????? BTW this is still a Great Copy!
,kabsat,2010-07-22T03:21Z,Good Quality! Thanks for sharing! Time for me to SEED!
,Slap_My_Camel,2010-07-22T09:31Z,does anyone know whether this is the full version because on lots of the other karate kid 2010 torrents it says its missing the last 20mins so if someone could please reply wether its the full version or not thanks :)

In truth the edited scenes dont take a whole lot out of the  movie but there are a few that really need to have been left in."

Good quality though and perfectly watchable."

,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-07-28T21:57Z,"Pretty much DVD quality. The only thing that sucks is there are no subtitles during the non-English parts. But you can download the subtitles if you google it. I found them and it works fine with the movie.

,orinvee,2010-08-05T19:47Z,"Because I hadn't used my service provider's email for years (the one provided by the DSL supplier), instead using web mail (like Hotmail, etc.), I wasn't aware that I had received several copyright warnings over the last couple of years. Obviously, they warn a whole lot more than they actually seek to prosecute. In other words, I assume that, for the most part, they are just empty threats designed to discourage piracy. Nevertheless, I suspect that excessive dl'ing might cause one to be targeted to be an example (especially if you are financially secure). 

WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT RESPOND TO THE WARNINGS! JUST IGNORE THEM! Responding to the threats would imply culpability. As far as they know, ANYONE could have used YOUR ISP connection, even if you use encryption.

Ignore, and chill for a bit...try bowling or card playing for awhile."
