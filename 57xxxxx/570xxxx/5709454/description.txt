Instalation contains NO VIRUSES!
Some anti-virus programs may think that RLD-JEKG.EXE or RLD-JSTRKG.EXE are infected.
That's not true!
Those files are RELOADED keygens.

Joint Operations FULL pack includes:

Joint Operations: Typhoon Rising (1.6.9.2 + 1.7.1.9-for wide screen);
Joint Operations: Escalation;
Joint Operations: International Conflict (4.1.2 + patches to 4.1.8 if needed);
Joint Operations: International Conflict: Europe (2.01);

Automatic key generation and writing to registry tool(...JointOps/keyreg/jowrite.exe)
Lan-game connection tools (BatleLAN + AUTAPF) (...JointOps/ConnectionTools/)

FILELIST:

JointOpsFULLAW2.exe
README.txt

HOWTO:
To install JO+Esc+IC+ICE simply run JointOpsFULL.exe to start install.
At the end if you want to use AutoKeyGen-tool check the "Autoreg keys (recommended)" check-box;

To install AW2 run JointOpsFULLAW2.exe.
At the end you must pick only ONE checkbox!
If you already have another JO installed you should choose "Launch this if you had separate Joint Operations installation"
If you are installing AW2 only check "Launch this if you install AW2 only"
Don't use both!

If you have the GDC 013 error "Please ensure you running latest consumer version install (GDC013)"
that may mean that you need to change cd-key.
You should use "Autochange CDKIID" from "Start" menu. 
Or you can run jowrite.exe from your "...JointOps/Keyreg" folder.

If you have wide-screen display run "Switch EXE (1.6.9.2-1.7.1.9)" from start menu so you can use wide-screen resolutions

If you want to connect to server you can choose between BatleLAN and AUTAPF.
You can also start them from start-menu.
