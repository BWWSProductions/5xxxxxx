How it attacks your computer is when you try to open this file. The window freezes and stops reporting. The only way out is to shut down the computer. The virus is affects the explorer.exe process so when you ""End task"" the unresponsive window, it also deletes your explorer.exe. 
To find your computer's explorer.exe, press ctrl+alt+delete and it's under 'Processes'."
