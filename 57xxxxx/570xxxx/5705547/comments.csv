Good enough for me. Man what a freaked film. But hell that was a crazy contrived ending. Holy crap, the dude screws the hybrid, goes home and says, ""Honey, I fucked our daughter Dren the hybrid... shit happens, but it wont happen again!"" And like 1 1/2 hour later Dren the hybrid has a full grown devil child. Only at the movies, lol. "
