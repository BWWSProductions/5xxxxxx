This is a 1988 Canadian childrens movie. If you grew up in Canada during the time you may remember it. It is almost too much to take in as an adult but it is worth a laugh if you watched it as a kid (which if you did you probally wathced it over and over since it seems to really have something to it for children). It took me quite awhile to track this down so I hope someone else finds this usefull. If you know the name watch out for Rufus Wainwright where he makes one of his first appearences.

                    Also if anyone has the seqeul and would post it that would be awesome (it is almost impossible to find a copy out there)
