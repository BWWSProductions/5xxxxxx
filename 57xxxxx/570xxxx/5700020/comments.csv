One more request can you make a multi OS DVD combining Xp, Vista & Win. 7???"
,robegrei,2010-08-04T09:56Z,FYI: Bad news for MicroXP users - any installations that are not unattended will not install (license error). The fix is on retestrak.nl forum.
[T],Antje14,2010-08-23T03:47Z,I don't think those would all fit on one single layer DVD

Can you give me the serial / crack / any way to activate and use ""Colasoft Capsa Enterprise"" 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Capsa Enterprise Edition
Capsa Network Analyzer (Packet Sniffer) is an easy-to-use Ethernet network analyzer (aka. packet sniffer or protocol analyzer) for network monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.

Start at: $549.00 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Isnt this overpriced? We are getting open source beauty Wireshark for absolutely free. :)  But this Capsa got some nice features that i miss on Wireshark. 

Hope you will help me. Thanks

,physixmaster,2010-09-11T23:18Z,"Can you not use Backtrack4 for packet sniffing, It has loads of tools (Ettercap, Wireshark etc etc) I am sure you can find one with the feature/s that you require. Using windows for packet sniffing is like putting a Ferrari engine in a bus, time consuming and not very efficent. 549 bucks is massively overpriced, who owns it... Microsoft?"
,physixmaster,2010-09-11T23:19Z,"But i do like its graphs though, its pretty cool but still overpriced"
,NCWitch,2010-09-12T18:05Z,I hope someone on here can help me.  I'm looking for the last session.ini for MicroXP so I can make my own MicroXP so I can leave the manual install files so I can install this from my usb thumb drive.  The description says it should be in the XP04\I386\SVCPACK\NLITE folder but I can't find that folder anywhere.  Any help would be appreciated.
