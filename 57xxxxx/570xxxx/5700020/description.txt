 - Full XP
 This has most of the required hotfixes slipstreamed with nLite,
 other odd hotfixes that cannot be slipstreamed (for example KB890830)
 are installed on first logon. This also includes IE8 and slipstreamed
 WMP11 with all hotfixes.

 - Slimmed XP
 Same as above with WMP11 slipstreamed, but this has a few items
 removed, the only item that might be needed is Chinese, Japanese
 and Korean. The only other items removed are redundant items like
 the Windows XP "Tour".

 - TinyXP
 This aims to remove only the big components in Windows. Its smaller
 size comes not from taking out items, but by simply not updating
 to IE8 or WMP11 and instead, updating the OS the same way to June
 2010 but with IE6 and WMP9 like the original XP. You will only see
 one Windows Update appear for this on Windows Update - "Internet
 Explorer 8"

 - MicroXP
 This is, as usual, stripped right down to the bare OS almost. 

 ________________________________________________________________________

 The Server 2003 versions are the same as above in terms of removed
 components, for example, Tiny2003 has the same items removed as
 TinyXP.

 ________________________________________________________________________

 All installations are "typical" installations in that you can access
 the Repair Option or Recovery Console - even the MicroXP and Micro2003
 versions are NOT unattended. This allows you to choose your keyboard
 and timezone etc as Windows installs. If you don't like this and want
 an unattended installation, no problem, just look in the ISO folder
 on the DVD and there you have 32 options for making a CD sized ISO file.

 Drivers are automatically included with all eight installations.

 ________________________________________________________________________

 To install Windows from this DVD, set your PC up so it will boot from
 the CD/DVD-ROM in the PC's BIOS.

 You do not need any product key for any of the installations.

 ________________________________________________________________________

 DRIVERS

 You have the following drivers in all 8 options:

 - Chipset --------> (included by default)
 - CPU ------------> (included by default)
 - Graphics -------> (included by default)
 - LAN Ethernet ---> (included by default)
 - SATA -----------> (included by default)
 - Sound ----------> (included by default)
 - Wireless LAN ---> (included by default)

 When the PC reboots for the first time during installation (just after
 Windows files have copied) then you will see a driver selector pop up.

 If you do not catch this in time, or are not sat at the PC when this
 driver selector has timed out (after one minute) then all the drivers
 will extract - bear in mind, this will take a few gigabytes of disk
 space. If you do not want to extract the driverpacks, make sure you
 are sat at the PC after the files have copied and it reboots.

 Option 7 = WS03\I386\SVCPACK\NLITE\Last Session.ini
 Option 8 = WS04\I386\SVCPACK\NLITE\Last Session.ini

 Most of these folders contain quick solutions to things that otherwise
 would be buried away in the Windows GUI, or require DOS style commands.
