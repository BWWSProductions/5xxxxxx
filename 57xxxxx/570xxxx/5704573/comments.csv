Hello mate,

the increase in size is only because of the length of those movies "

,johnnybop8,2010-07-21T05:40Z,"Thanks very much indeed for this upload and all your great quality work, I appreciate it. Will seed a long time. Greetings!"
,muk0690,2010-07-21T06:55Z,"@all: 

the size of the file depends on the duration of the movie and the bitrate...... For a few movies which have high amount of special effects requires more bitrate and therefore the big size.....

All his recent uploads are lengthy movies. So the big size.....

Stop bugging him with these questions"

,JackTheForest,2011-01-03T05:09Z,"To many people use 720p and 1080p to get attention for their torrents.

800MB for 720p would be a revolution. Say what it it is and no more or less and everybody is happy, but practising advertisment like the industry will be the end for the ""community""."
,JackTheForest,2011-01-03T05:12Z,"My favourite is ""HD"" for most TV Series torrents is when when it has been recorded from HD television and is in the end no more than a bad DVD RIP."
,georgiqg,2011-01-04T13:43Z,"It's 720p, but the video bitrate is only 650 kbps. You can have a 1080p but with a small bitrate, you're not going to get a good quality.
For a 720p movie, the bitrate should be 1500+ if you want a clear image."

this is not a 720p 
peace."
,TallWhiteGuy,2011-01-18T08:06Z,not 720! watchable on small screen but not really on a big screen tv!
,TallWhiteGuy,2011-01-18T15:34Z,not suitable for big scree tv's ... definitly not 720p! but ok for laptop or small screen...
,ManuelRivero,2011-01-19T00:03Z,"A grainy handheld camera movie with a 3 hour length compressed down to 800MB?
Funny guy! Give it at least 800MB/hour."
,chem41,2011-02-05T05:06Z,disappointed wid quality

,WeedPirate,2011-02-12T08:43Z,wow Riddler usually has good ones.. but this one is like a dvdrip upconverted to 720p.. i still love ya though lol
,apochai,2011-02-14T17:43Z,c'mon seed!!!! u bastardsssss!!!!
,113maddog,2011-03-13T19:35Z,why is this 804mb shit remains on the top ten list of higres moviesfor weeks!!! stupid fucking idiots this cant be a 720p!!!! stupid fuks morons idiots!! dont download this shit and kick this out of the top 100!!
,waftinghaze,2011-03-30T22:44Z,Quality is definitely OK on a smaller screen.  It's a keeper for my laptop.
,Robbah,2011-04-17T18:35Z,"Not 720. Wrong section. Please put these where they belong.

V=5

,jorge56,2011-04-25T04:29Z,"I don't know why some are complaining, come on guys you don't see the file size, it says 800MB!!!!! What do you expect from a 3 hour movie and only 800mb?. "
,kinvore,2011-05-04T21:30Z,"Thanks for the up!  Sorry if I seem like a hater but I have to agree, this is NOT 720.  Don't understand why people can't properly categorize their movies.

Still it's a nice video and sound, it's just not a high def picture."
,gibbonman,2011-05-16T11:15Z,Shaving Ryans Privates
,harrisventura,2011-05-19T13:38Z,"The quality is like you always get from RiddlerA, i.e. it's good. Like your average 700MB AVI DVD rip for a 90 minute movie. Don't be put off by the 800MB for 160mins. That's the magic of MKV. Cutting the credits is a bit unnecessary though, especially so abruptly after the emotional ending. You need the credits to wind down."
,Zenith_170,2011-05-30T11:52Z,"might nt be a 720p,bt def gud quality. fr 800mb, excellent quality...sample has been provided to check d print guys...if u dnt lik, dnt download....dnt unnecessarily curse d print here....u cn go fr 3gb ones if u lik....fr 800mb its a pretty gud print!!!"
,bigtofdc,2011-06-04T02:41Z,one of my favorite movies!!! thanks a lot!
,teemu92,2011-06-12T05:05Z,"great torrent, downloaded in 25mins :D there are no subtitles in the video, and didnt come with a subtitle file, so thats a bit sad but thanks for the movie anyway +1"
,DiiGiiTAL,2011-07-10T18:44Z,"Fast download, but this is NOT 720p. It's just a DVD rip.

Meh."

,LilDaithi,2011-08-03T19:58Z,"Decent quality, good movie."
,kinchad,2011-08-06T12:29Z,Thank you ;)
,AlexReborn,2011-08-14T14:50Z,"I've seen better torrents from RiddlerA before and I appreciate the work he does but this one is quite poor quality. I think I would prefer to download a larger file and at least have a clear image.

Hope you keep going though!"
,himegoto,2011-08-16T04:26Z,I agree the quality is poor on this one. I really cant see this as a 720p. And this movie deserves a bigger size download.
,chaosheritage,2011-09-24T00:47Z,"Thanks a lot V7 A9, good watch for compression."

,mockcongler,2011-12-16T23:09Z,Disappointingly bad quality. Go with a different torrent.
,cris12821,2012-01-28T00:24Z,"Absoulutely phenomenal.  The quality was fantastic, the sounds was great. Watched it with my WDtv box and made the movie fantastic.     for all you people making fun of war movies or this movie in general, theres this thing called a heart, maybe you should learn how to use it.   There was SOO many war movie I've seen and every single one made me cry. 

I HIGHLY recomend watching this movie, its fantastic.    But heres a fact/question for you all, how do u go through each and every day knowing there soldiers out there keeping our country safe.    I dont understand how some people could make fun of those people or not care for the soldiers cause you know what,  without our soldiers protecting our country... we wouldnt be alive today.    U have a heart, learn to use it.


GREAT torrent I really appreciate your fantastic work."
,cris12821,2012-01-28T00:26Z,I rather die protecting my country and doing what is right. Than sit around and let everyone die infront of me because of our own problems.
