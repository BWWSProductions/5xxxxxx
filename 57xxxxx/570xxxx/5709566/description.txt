The Complete Russell Brand Show, from December 2005 to October 2008.

The Russell Brand Show was a radio show in the United Kingdom which was broadcast on 
Saturdays on BBC Radio 2. The show was hosted by comedian Russell Brand who started his radio career in 2002 on a Sunday afternoon show on Xfm. Russell's co-host was long-term friend, Matt Morgan who had worked with Brand on other TV projects. Noel Gallagher was also described by Russell, as a third, unofficial, co-host.
Each show was concluded by a summing-up poem by Mr Gee. The show originally featured contributions from comedian Trevor Lock, who left in March 2007 to pursue other projects including his own show on BBC 6 Music.
However Russell Brand's show ended when he resigned due to complaints from the public over his, and his guest Jonathan Ross' prank calls to veteran actor Andrew Sachs.
