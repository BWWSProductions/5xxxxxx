Maybe not for the boys, my partner gave up in the first 15mins. The Audio and Video was excellent, this is all just my opinion."

Do not click on Party Poker. 
It puts Antimalware Doctor on your computer. Antimalware Doctor is  rogue anti-spyware, a total scam. It will give you nothing but trouble. It stops you from using your computer. Also Party Poker puts this a annoying popup on your screen when your on the net.
I have a few computers and how I know its coming through facebook is thats the only site my daughter goes on. and its only that coumpter thats infected."

,Reccasan,2010-08-30T23:12Z,"i agree totally... miley is good for only porn movies.

God only knows, how wid that hideous voice of her she became a singer!!!

On that note i am doubtful she will be able to succeed even in porn.

BTW the movie sucks ass. Anyone wid ballz shud avoid this."
,zohotar,2010-09-01T19:51Z,up is great as always!Its  Extremezone for cr at loud! The movie is so bad... like a punishment for something u maybe did in ur past life !
,texasdragonman,2010-09-17T00:14Z,"knowing how Far down the list my comment is im not sure how many folks will actually read this...

i feel the need to point out that this was actually a decently acted movie in regards to teen dramatic romances... please watch the movie for yourself.
after reading the many slams on Miley Cyrus.. im personally Doubtful the people talking shit about her and her acting skills have even watched this movie, and instead are basing thier judgement on her disney channel career which is SUPPOSSED to be silly and dumb... her acting in this film, while not oscar worthy was passible and the story in general was deep and heartwrenching. i would recommend this movie to anyone who has seen and enjoyed Movies such as ""My life as a House"" or ""a walk to remember""

,RanDoRian,2010-09-20T01:14Z,"WTF

Seen this movie thousands of times....

The cliche of talented girl gets sad and angry cuz her parents split up, spend summer at dad's meets people, stuff happens girl eventually ends up at  big ass school loving her parents etc....
blablabla

,Wabb-a-jack,2012-01-02T07:37Z,"I'll have to agree with Sheldon. I was not surprised to find so many negative comments, for that simple reason that young people seem to gather around these mainstream talent icons to unload all the hate and frustration form their own lives unto someone else. 

So i quickly picked up the impression that this movie were not to be seen, but i did it anyhow and got myself a surprise. Thanks to ExtremeZone for always UP'ing good quality content. Big Up! 

I'll keep seeding' as long as it's popular:)
