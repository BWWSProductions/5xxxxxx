2009 National Geographic documentary based on Rob Lilwall's original camcorder footage.

"In September 2004 I began this journey by flying with my bicycle as far away from home as I could think of: to the Far Eastern side of Siberia. My intention was to cycle back to England via the most interesting route I could find."
