    Bruce Forsyth receives a letter from America from a        
    woman who claims to be related to Bruce through Bruce's   
    great-grandfather, Joseph Forsyth Johnson. The letter    
    suggests that Joseph Forsyth Johnson was married to two   
    women at the same time and that he died at sea. Bruce      
    is determined to investigate these claims and discover    
    the truth for himself.                                   
                                                              
    Bruce starts by visiting his cousin, Alan Johnson, who     
    gives him a cache of family photographs and the diary     
    of his great Aunt Christina, which he takes with him.    
    Alan also gives him Joseph's business card - a vital      
    aid for Bruce in tracking Joseph and his family's steps    
    in the late 19th century.                                 
                                                             
    Bruce follows the business card to Bond Street, London,   
    where Joseph opened a landscape gardening shop. Knowing    
    that Joseph worked in America at some point, Bruce        
    tracks down the passenger lists for Joseph's journey     
    and is in for a shock. He heads off to New York on        
    Joseph's trail, which then takes him to the American       
    South.                                                    
                                                             
    Bruce's quest to uncover his great grandfather's secret   
    history ends back in New York where he finally             
    discovers Joseph's fate. Joseph was a man who was both    
    an extraordinary pioneer in his field; but also a man    
    who bucked the social mores of the day and paid dearly    
    for it, leaving a trail of confusion and unhappiness in    
    his wake.

    The BBC are rewriting episode/season history, last year    
    we released s7, the bbc have now decided that those eps   
    were the 2nd part of season 6, what they will be listed  
    as next year we honestly dont know, it's rather hard to   
    make sense of their listings considering it was labelled   
    by them as s7 at the time, imdb still lists the           
    new season as s8, but that could change tonight          
    /tomorrow/next week.

    We leave it up to folks to decide whether they want to     
    label as s7 or s8, as quite frankly it gives us a head    
    -ache trying to follow bbc labelling decisions sometimes.
