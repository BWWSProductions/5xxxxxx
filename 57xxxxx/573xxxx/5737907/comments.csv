,Cryder,2010-08-04T19:03Z,"FXG uploads torrents a few days to a few weeks before the DVD comes out. He doesn't upload screeners or anything else other than DVD rips (and 1 BR rip). At least on this account he doesn't. So stop asking him for torrents of movies that are still out in theaters, he won't do it. You have to either wait, download from someone else, or *shudder* pay for it."
,snilloc,2010-08-04T23:35Z,"@ Cryder.... Who died and left you in charge?  

I am sure the FxG team are more than capable of speaking for themselves. "
,zeitgeistmandvdrip,2010-08-05T20:21Z,"if you ( everybody ) look at a torrent and it has no screenshots or link to boxcover/official info about the file  google it and copy and paste links to the info to help everyone else out ! please dont be lazy and expect the uploaders to do everything..do it yourself , the more people stop being selfish & expecting someone else to do this the better off well all be, the piratebay may not be around forever so help out right now !

,daemonesc,2010-08-16T19:14Z,my appologies i must have clicked on one of those fake ones as i was flicking through the list ....oops clearly a break in my concentration ..
,parasites,2010-08-17T08:54Z,"Facebook Warning.
Do not click on Party Poker. 
It puts Antimalware Doctor on your computer. Antimalware Doctor is  rogue anti-spyware, a total scam. It will give you nothing but trouble. It stops you from using your computer. Also Party Poker puts this a annoying popup on your screen when your on the net.
I have a few computers and how I know its coming through facebook is thats the only site my daughter goes on. and its only that coumpter thats infected."

,MrSpoiler,2010-08-18T19:17Z,"Tina Fey is a hot, hot MILF who is having bed troubles with her incompetent husband Steve Carrell who can't get it up anymore.

In a bid for a little excitement, they drive from Jersey to Manhattan to crash a swanky restaurant without having a reservation. They succeed by pretending to be Harry Osbourne & Mila Kunis. Olivia Munn totally believes it and unfortunately, so do a couple of dirty cops & the Ray Liotta Mafia who want a generic MacGuffin plot device from them.

They then do things which make *completely* no sense one after another and end up meeting a half-naked Mark Wahlberg who Fey flirts with. In revenge, Carrell takes Wahlberg's expensive Audi and completely trashes it.

Finally, they come to their senses and call the cops who then sort things out. The end."

Use DVD Decrypter to rip dvd to hard drive. Then use Auto Gordian Knot to convert to AVI. And to conver to other formats use ImTOO HD Video Converter. I use all of these programs.
