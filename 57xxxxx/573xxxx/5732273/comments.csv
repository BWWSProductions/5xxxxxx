VA - Voodoo Surf  (Exellent East European And Russian Surf Music) [2009]
CD (2009) To MP3 320 Kbit/s.
Included: CD Covers & This Info.

This is a exellent album for you to explore todays surf music from east Europe and Russia .I love this album, they can realy play surf music in the east. 
I don't know what years the tracks are from, but i guess it's from ca 2000 to 2009.

This is a very generous compilation of European and Russian surf bands that deftly dive into the genre with various experimentations tagging along. Our old friends, The Vivisectors are on board and one of the first Ukrainian bands (that plays surf brilliantly) handles the uneasy task of creating some intellectual surf music. From the very first, ?Night Surfers"" prove that they are not afraid of instrumental experiments - bravely mixing up classic surf, The Cure-like post-punk, funk and psychedelic rock of 1960s. Of course, the other combos hold up well too on this disc. For a twist on the ""surf' discipline, the CD we have here is an excellent choice for those wanting a bit more ""edge"" in the music. Additional instrumental comps of russian and ex-USSR surf ensembles.Here have well known and new musicians,covers and authors compositions.Exellent example for the first meeting with russian surf-scene.
