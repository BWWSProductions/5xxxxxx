Question: What is a DAT File?

Did you find a DAT file on your computer and wonder what program should open it? Maybe someone emailed you a DAT file but you're not sure how to use it. Perhaps you tried to open the DAT file but Windows told you that it could not open it.

Before you can open a DAT file (assuming it's even a file format that's intended to be viewed or edited), you'll need to determine what kind of file the DAT file extension refers to.
Answer: A file with the DAT file extension is a Data file.

Other types of files that use the DAT extension include VCD video files and some email program file attachments. If you know of any additional file formats that use the DAT extension, please let me know so I can update this information.
How to Open a DAT File:

The easiest way to open a DAT file is to double-click on it and let your PC decide which default application should open the file. If no program opens the DAT file then you probably don't have an application installed that can view and/or edit DAT files.

Warning: Take great care when opening executable file formats received via email or downloaded from websites you're not familiar with. See my List of Executable File Extensions for a listing of file extensions to avoid and why.

If the DAT file is actually a generic Data file, the program that generated the DAT file is your best bet for opening the file but you should try a text editor if that doesn't work. DAT files that are video files can be opened with programs like VCDGear and CyberLink PowerDirector, among others. DAT mail files can be opened by whatever email program generated the DAT file."
