[V],nightissuchproximity,2010-08-04T10:35Z,"Chuck Berry’s legendary breakthrough 1950s Chess recordings has gotten their first thorough presentation anywhere via a 4-CD, 103-song box set on Chess/Hip-O Select Records. These are the groundbreaking recordings by the first poet laureate of rock ’n’ roll that set the tone lyrically and musically for all that came after. To paraphrase John Lennon, if they didn’t call it rock ’n’ roll, they’d call it Chuck Berry music, and this remarkable new set shows why. Digitally remastered from the original Chess masters, the collection features not only such oft-covered classics as “Maybellene,” “Roll Over Beethoven,” “Rock And Roll Music,” “Memphis,” “Sweet Little Sixteen,” “Johnny B. Goode,” “Carol,” and “Little Queenie,” but it also shows the evolution of the artist and his songs, while presenting a surfeit of rarities, including 16 previously unreleased tracks.
