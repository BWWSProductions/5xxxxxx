Motley Crue - Uncensored HQ MUSIC VIDEO MPEG-2
==================================================================================

This was recorded in 1986 when Motley Crue was making it big.  I think it is the first video release.  It has 25 uncensored minutes behind the scenes.
I Love this video.

Note: This file was ripped from LaserDisc with an ATI All-In-Wonder X800XT Video   Card.

Please let me know if there is a better preferred format or a better card for recording video from my LaserDisc player.

What do you think about the quality?

I may have over did it a little bit on the large file size, but I am sick of downloading poor quality videos.  I posted this version for all the people out there that want a quality file.
