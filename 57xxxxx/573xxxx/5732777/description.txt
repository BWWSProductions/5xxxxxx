NOTE :: Audio is very bad during the first couple of minutes of hour 1.



The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.


The Infowars web site describes today's show:

Alex will discuss a host of vital issues including an Oxford professor calling for drugging the water supply, Citi field being overrun by illegal aliens waving Mexican flags, impending world war III, and more. Alex also covers the latest news and takes your calls.
