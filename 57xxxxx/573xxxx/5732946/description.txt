I have been collecting multitracks for mixing.
I have filled several DVDs with them now. It took me a while so I thought i'd make the process easier for you guys! :)

These are either in .ogg format or .mogg

if in .mogg get audacity (its free, google it) and open up the .mogg file to see the seperate tracks then export multiple.

i think the majority of these are from rock band and guitar hero etc.

This is disc 1, if this gets a lot of interest i'll upload more

Please seed :)
