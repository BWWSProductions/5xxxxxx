    This one-hour documentary special is a film celebration of America's     
    greatest icon of youth, freedom and the automobile. What began as an     
    auto parts owner's business venture to make some easy money              
    accidentally became a magical place where romance, fun and a sense of    
    community flourished. This film chronicles the drive-in's birth and      
    development, its phenomenal popularity with audiences of all ages,       
    its tragic decline, and its inevitable comeback as a classic form of     
    Americana.                                                               
                                                                             
    Described by Variety as "slick and entertaining," DRIVE-IN MOVIE         
    MEMORIES includes photos and footage from the mid-1930s until today,     
    a powerful original music score, and lively interviews with such         
    notables as Leonard Maltin, Barry Corbin, Burton Gilliam, Beverly        
    Garland, Samuel Arkoff, and John Bloom (aka Joe Bob Briggs).
