Monster trucks come to the PlayStation with THUNDER TRUCK RALLY. There are a total of nine drivers to choose from, each with a unique truck. After choosing a driver, you can choose to compete in three different styles of race: Circuit, Endurance, and Car Crush. Circuit has you trying to complete a certain number of laps on a particular track, Endurance calls for you to race through nine checkpoints in a specific order, and in Car Crush you try to get the fastest time while driving over cars. All three of these race types can be played in the Championship, Practice, Multiplayer, and Time Trial modes. Now, thanks to THUNDER TRUCK RALLY you can get monster truck action on any day of the week.
