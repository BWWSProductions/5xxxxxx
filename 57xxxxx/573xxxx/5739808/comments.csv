,MikeThePirate1989,2010-08-08T20:24Z,"I have downloaded this and was really looking forward to play it! (i Have the CXZ port).
But when i'm loading the game the menu is not showing up. I can only hear the music and watch the background.. 

Anyone else with this problem?"
,CommunistEyes,2010-08-10T03:40Z,"Would love to try this out. Seed, please! Thank you."
,CommunistEyes,2010-08-11T06:49Z,Works flawlessly. Thanks!
,joey_dman,2010-09-26T11:33Z,if it dosn't work how does it work flawlessly
,crushh12,2010-11-12T15:07Z,"Don't worry all I have a FIX !
First u must download this =http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5291982/CXZ_Game_Engines_%5BMAC%5D

Eject all mounted images and then open the NHL DMG,

NHL may state the same problem but then the CXZ port app will open and the game will open and work flawlessly"
,jhshifris,2011-03-09T22:37Z,Is this really for the Mac?
,lisapower,2011-10-06T20:57Z,"Not working on Lion, i updated the CXZ wrapper with CXZ central, but no luck.

i only can hear music, Video not working (some kind of black screen)."
,lisapower,2011-10-06T20:58Z,"by the way, a NHL Game for Mac would be Amazing."
