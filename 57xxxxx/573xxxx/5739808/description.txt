NHL 2005 [Intel/CXZ Port by LCANT]


Language: English


The decade-long obsession begun by EA's Genesis-era hockey titles continues with NHL 2005. This year's enhancements include smarter and less scripted player AI, context-sensitive control features based more on the personalities of each real player (enforcers will have the power to level players, whereas more technical pros will have use more of finesse), easier player control for skating backwards and gliding after a sprint, Open Ice Control for coordinating players into better passing positions, and improvements to the robust Dynasty mode.
