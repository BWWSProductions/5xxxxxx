,Mimsy,2010-08-04T11:43Z,"As far as I know it is true, she and ''Naomi'', who is also famous, were diagnosed in January, along with 14 other performers. "
[T],youssef0eddoumali,2010-08-04T16:00Z,"yes but the list of the other 14 performers is not yet public, any idea?"
,ONeg,2010-09-13T23:51Z,"See...now I feel fucked up. I wasn't gonna download tihs, until I heard she got the HIV. Her stuff just became limited edition."
,biotrin,2010-12-23T14:40Z,She does not have HIV... she has conformed to be tested negative for it and is going to have a baby in january-february 2011. That is the reason she retired from the industry which caused the speculation that she was infected.
