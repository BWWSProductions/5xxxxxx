On REGRETFULLY YOURS, its first full-length album, Superdrag refines pop to its very essence and then adds a few dreamy layers of guitars. The result is an album of quality pop songs that hark back to such forebears as the Beatles and the Jam while asserting a post-punk heritage; the melodious feedback atop these songs is a love note to Husker Du and My Bloody Valentine.

"Cynicality" is typical of Superdrag's melding of bubblegum pop with indie-rock experimentation. It begins with a thick layer of fuzzy guitars, but proceeds to a chorus driven by '60s-style handclaps. The key to Superdrag's music is the song beneath the noise. In direct contrast to a lot of similar-sounding bands, the song is the entree, the guitar effects merely garnishes. It's clear that underneath the guitar pedal pushing, this band has nothing to hide.


Superdrag: John Davis (vocals, guitars, piano, organ, Mellotron); Brandon Fisher (guitars, background vocals); Tom Pappas (bass, background vocals); Don Coffey, Jr. (drums, background vocals).
