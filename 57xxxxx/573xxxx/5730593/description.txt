GIN RUMMY - EXPERIENCE US @ http://ginrummy.co.cc

-------------------------------------------------

Gin Rummy is a three-piece punk rock band hailing from Stoney Creek, Ontario. The band takes inspiration from many different artists such as Sublime, Blink-182 and The Fullblast. The band is committed to providing fun and loud songs that everyone can relate to.

Mixing different genres and sounds to create something totally original and unique is what Gin Rummy is about. The sweet tangy sound of Joey's guitar, the rythmical orgy of Mark's bass, and the mind blowing sounds of Foster's drums is enough to make you scream for pleasure. With our second disc on the way, Gin Rummy shows no signs of slowing down.
