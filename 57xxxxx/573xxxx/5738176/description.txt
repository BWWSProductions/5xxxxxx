The Odd Job is a 1978 British comedy film starring Graham Chapman 
(who previously starred in Monty Python's Flying Circus). It 
tells the story of a man named Arthur Harris (Chapman) who is 
recently abandoned by his wife. He becomes so depressed that he 
hires an "odd job man" to kill him. Once his wife returns, Harris 
finds himself unable to cancel the contract.

The concept was originally made as an episode of the London 
Weekend Television/ITV series 6 Dates With Barker in 1971, with 
Ronnie Barker as Arthur Harris and David Jason as the Odd Job Man 
(who plays the same role in the feature film).

The role of the odd job man was originally intended for Chapman's 
friend, Keith Moon, but Moon was going through alcohol withdrawal 
at the time and in no real physical shape to play the part, 
although he did audition.
