,tywdyfor,2010-09-12T18:36Z,Hang on a sec. Why is this movie saved as an .ISO file? Could be a complete waste of 8 Gigs. Anyone downloaded it got a comment?
,winode_sv,2010-09-13T18:17Z,"When I use Daemon Tools to mount ISO file, it wont play either with VLC or WMPlayer.

I tried to unrar the ISO file, and see nothing inside. However, the file size is 7.9Gigs.

Some one has a better idea to play this if at all this can be played. Dont know if this can be played at all."
,winode_sv,2010-09-13T18:30Z,"hey! I found a way. If you mount the ISO on Daemon tools, just browse through the Disc in a windows explorer, and open the  drive:\BDMV\STREAM and play in VLC. I plays OK, but the Video quality isnt great."
,Broz007,2010-11-07T20:00Z,"Somebody help , please!
I can`t open this file. I`ve try it mount with Power ISO, Deamon tools and Virtual Clone Drive but the file is not supported by Windows!????
