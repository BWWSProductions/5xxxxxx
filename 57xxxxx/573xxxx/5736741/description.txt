People have faulted the Lowry restoration for looking like plastic and being screwed up color-wise so I made this version using the 1995 laserdisc video.

  Differences from Official DVD
  -----------------------------
  
    * The authoring is different.  I did not even try to replicate the menus.
    * Movie only, no other features.
    * Only one audio mix, Theatrical Mono (taken from the official DVD).
    * The video, while slightly lower in actual quality, may be higher in
      perceived quality because it is not overly restored, to the point it
      no longer looks like handmade animation on film.  (The 1995 release
      used as source is also remastered.)
    * The RKO logo is intact, not plastered as on most home video releases.
      (The Disney logos have surrounded the movies as on the 1995 edition.)

  Identifying Marks
  -----------------
  
    * VaultBreakers bumper replaces FBI notice.
    * WDHV86 logo precedes menu; WDC88 "Metal Diamond" bumper displayed when
      "Play Film" is selected.
    * Following the Blue Castle is the logo for RKO:
      "Distributed by RKO Radio Pictures, Inc."  Only the 1995 LDs keep this.
