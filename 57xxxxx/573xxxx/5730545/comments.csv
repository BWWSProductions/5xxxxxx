Be warned I received a letter in the mail after I downloaded this from my internet provider. Proceed at your own risk!!!!
After you convert the files, they work great though."
,drewkrew,2010-10-15T12:34Z,"Many ISP's were sending out a mass-communication letter to all customers warning of copyright infringement through downloads...
There are many websites and forums dedicated to this topic as these letters have been sent to many innocent parties who never download any file of any sort and were proved to be a non-target set letter used to try and reduce the potential of copyright infringement through illegal downloading through the ISP's in question (so they look like they are doing their bit)

I can only advise that it is very unlikely that your ISP has directly targetted you, and that your right to internet privacy IS your right, and if anyone is really that scare-mongered by these corporate nonsense fake-threats, take measures to protect your privacy!
Change DNS servers to OpenDNS and such, etc etc!

Every torrent is the users choice on whether they download it or not. 
You know if it's legal or not, and if you already purchased this product then you are well within your right to create ""back-up discs"" to use if you wish to avoid the risk of damage to your original discs.

,drewkrew,2010-10-15T12:40Z,Sorry for the double post! Browser error/java script error
,ashling51,2010-10-21T20:31Z,Please please please seed. 
,Verimooth83,2010-11-04T21:52Z,"I downloaded it and it opens in divX but it is broken into smaller bits in VIDEO TS folder. I keep getting these error messages saying:  seeking functionality may be limited, This file appears to be corrupted. Seeking may be limited or behave unexpectedly. Or some small video bits will open and say: You may need an additional audio decoder to play this file. This file contains a track in an unknown format (code ""65534"") format. You may need to install a directshow decoder for this audio format in order to hear the soundtrack on this file. Sorry to paste specific quotes but this is all really frustrating and i'm not sure how to fix this. if you anyone has any advice I would be eternally grateful; i'm trying to integrate this program into my sons initial vocabulary development"
,enzoed420,2010-11-29T17:05Z,Isnt there flash cards???
,drewkrew,2010-12-11T00:09Z,"Right, i'll help clarify. 
These are DVD disc images, so you would burn them straight to DVD and they will then play on your standard DVD player.
You are obviously trying to play this on your pc as you would an "".avi"" file etc, and your media player is getting confused.
Just burn to DVD, it's a ready made DVD (DVDrip!) 

And to the flash card question: yes you did get some flash cards with the official purchase but these are not needed, and are purely there as a gimmick to aid the sale. All letters, words, and sounds are included on the DVD and visual to the child. The flash cards were meant for the adult to continue with the child without any DVD aid. 

Enjoy ;-)"
,MileKarina,2010-12-23T04:11Z,"I downloaded the entire file, but when I tried to burn it on my DVD it did not work. In other words, the files could not be transfered onto an empty dvd to be burned. Any help is much appreciated, my baby is illiterate :)"
,BMF916,2011-01-01T01:34Z,anybody download this without getting a copy infringement letter?
,vbtoons,2011-01-16T14:22Z,"Work great, any chance the docs and flash cards and other material can be uploaded in PDF? Thanks for the torrent!"
[T],SiRsMoKeAlOt0420,2011-01-31T16:10Z,agree with `vbtoons`. Any Chance in that request?

,TopShoTTa7,2011-02-13T05:24Z,"works awesome, i didnt get that infringement thing they were talking about, maybe cuz i downloaded them 1 disc at a time, i dunno..."
,TopShoTTa7,2011-02-13T05:39Z,"if your confused on how to burn this to dvd.... use image burn... the files are not iso's, you have to build them into an iso, then burn the iso to the dvd, both of which can be done with img burn...  click here for latest version... http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download"
,TopShoTTa7,2011-02-13T05:52Z,"p.s. "" iso "" is an image file, or disc image..."
,pepper_anne,2011-02-17T16:58Z,"this worked wonderfully! downloaded using utorrent and burned them to dvd using roxio!!

,miababy21,2011-11-10T16:05Z,"ok to play these on computer, i use vlc, use whatever program you want. but in vlc, open the program itself then click Media---> Open disc. . . --->the disc tab should be opened then go to where you saved the dvds. click your baby can read 1 - 5 then click the Video_TS folder. it will look empty but then click select folder and there you go! Enjoy
