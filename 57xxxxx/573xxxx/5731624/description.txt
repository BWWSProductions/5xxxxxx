Richard Linklater's innovative, digitally animated film Waking Life boasts an equally thought-provoking score written by Glover Gill and performed by the Tosca Tango Orchestra. Instead of trying to compete with the film's intense visuals with a musically busy score or pop songs, the largely tango and classical-inspired score provides a subtle backdrop to Waking Life's beautiful animation. That's not to say, however, that the film's music isn't just as creative in it's own right. Gill's score is fluid and ever-changing; pieces like "Pelo Negro" change from tense to brooding to sensual and back again at a moment's notice, reflecting the film's surreal, dreamlike nature. "La Cosa Pequena"'s winding melody, the lively, mischievous "El Cholulo" and "Super Sport," and dramatic "Ballade 4, Part 1" are a few of the highlights from this creatively imagined and performed score. ~ Heather Phares
