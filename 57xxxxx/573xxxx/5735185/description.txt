Are you young, sexually confused, just trying to get by? Do you sing, dance or 
possess some other talent? Welcome to the Garden Party. At the center of the story 
is 15-year-old April. She is running from one bad situation into another, hoping to 
find an answer that doesn't involve taking off her clothes. As April navigates Los 
Angeles, she falls in with a group of confused kids struggling to chase their dreams. 
The black widow at the center of this web is a sexy, pot-dealing realtor named Sally 
St. Clair. Anyone who gets too close falls victim to her kinky entanglements. For 
some it goes bad, for other worse.
