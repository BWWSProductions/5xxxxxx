- "I Have No Regret to Anybody in the Military. This is Clearly a Failure of Our Government"-Iraq War Vet Dan Choi Discharged Under Don't Ask Don't Tell

"As we mark the end of America's combat mission in Iraq," President Barack Obama said this week, "a grateful America must pay tribute to all who served there." He should have added "unless you're gay," because, despite his rhetoric, weeks earlier the commander in chief fired one of those Iraq vets: Lt. Dan Choi. Choi is a West Point graduate, an Arabic linguist and an Iraq war veteran. He was fired under the military's Don't Ask Don't Tell policy. We talk to him about his life, his coming out and his military service.


- Environmental Activist Jerry Cope on "The Crime of the Century: What BP and U.S. Government Don't Want You to Know"

Environmental activist Jerry Cope has spent the last few weeks traveling along the Gulf Coast and experiencing first-hand the contamination in the air and water. In an article being published on Huffington Post, Cope argues that instead of celebrating the allegedly vanishing oil, we should be concerned about the disappearance of marine life in the Gulf. He describes the Gulf as a "kill zone" and looks into where the marine animals have gone given that BP has reported a relatively low number of dead animals from the spill.
