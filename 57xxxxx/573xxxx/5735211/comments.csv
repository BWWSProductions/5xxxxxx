,mdiggity,2010-08-05T14:50Z,Hey MKVGuy... I love ur uploads... I (and about 10 others) are stuck at 99.9% on ur upload of eagle eye... any chance you can re-seed for a bit?
[V],MKVGuy,2010-08-05T20:29Z,"@thepunisher65, nice to see you back, m gud..

@pulasthi007m, yes

@mdiggity, that had problem from the start when I was new to uploading, my PC was crashed and when I got it back the file at my side itself showed 99.9%..
I found a rip which you can try
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5606517/Eagle_eye.2008.BRrip.Tiny.M1K3Y
or if you want to re-encode it and upload it for then you will have to wait for 2 weeks cuz the only source I am able find to TPB have less peers and a big size to download at my end.."
