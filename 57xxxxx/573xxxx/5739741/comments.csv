,jorrell0733,2010-08-04T23:28Z,"CyberJoe: Yes its fully activated but some people have reported that the activation hasnt worked for them, so Ive included an activator which works perfectly for those situations"
,crossfire6,2010-08-05T02:51Z,"While I'm pulling this down I'll appreciate any comments from anyone who has already installed it.  Thanks, jorrell0 for this torrent!  We are grateful for your work."
,Silent()Noise,2010-08-05T14:29Z,"OK, this is the second torrent i have downloaded and neither will work for me. If i unzip the files and use the setup, it tells me different .dll files are not valid, and something about auto run. So i tried burning the image to disk, with two different iso software and when i try to boot it says please insert valid boot media. Please tell me what im doing wrong. "
,jorrell0733,2010-08-05T14:54Z,"re: Silent Noise. You cant unzip this file as its an ISO file and your installation will be corrupted. Secondly, if you burn to disk and your getting invalid boot media, then you need to change your boot sequence in DOS to your CD/DVD drive as your PC is trying to find the boot loader from your HDD"
,Silent()Noise,2010-08-05T15:33Z,"I will try what you say, but i doubt it will work. Because i hit f8 and my computor asked me what to boot from, and i picked the dvd drive with this media installed. However, im going to try again with a different burning software. What do you use to burn this?"
[V],Anacondaz,2010-08-05T15:49Z,"USE POWER ISO
OR IMAGE BURN WHICH IS FREE ALSO BURN THE DVD IN THE SLOWEST SPEED POSSIBLE
HOPE THIS ONE HELPS
LONG LIVE TPB"
,jorrell0733,2010-08-05T15:58Z,"RE: SilentNoise. I use Magic ISO to burn this ISO. The Image file is already bootable so hitting F8 for ur boot menu should be working. Make sure you perform a clean install with this disc, it is not an upgrade version. Alternatively you can use a flash drive to install which i have also tested and works pefectly. Ive used this copy of Win7 to install on over 5 PC's so far so i know it defiantely works. If you try with a flash drive make sure you format the flash drive first to NTFS and copy the boot file (boot.bif) to the drive. Full instructions on how to do this are here>> http://www.computingunleashed.com/install-windows-7-from-pendrive-how-to.html"
,fergie56,2010-08-05T21:13Z,"jorrell Thanks  your activator worked like a charm! I had download other AIO but installed as upgrade and it flagged me!
 Great was flagged as Trojan by MSSE  but checked after quarantined and not apparent!
 Great upload! Thanks again!"
,Silent()Noise,2010-08-06T00:01Z,"ok man, i used the iso burner you said, and i burned this thing a 2x just to be sure. this time it booted, but it just stps ant the blue install screen with the leaves, and doesnt go any further."
,Silent()Noise,2010-08-06T00:03Z,"Nevermind, i just wasnt near patient enough. Thanks for your help man."
,Silent()Noise,2010-08-06T01:44Z,"Well i thought i had it, but now its asking for cd rom drivers. wtf man. anybody know the fix for this?"
,grizzmo,2010-08-06T16:10Z,"@Silent()Noise,

had the same problems with another version.
Seems like your HD is a little corrupted.
After trying long enough you probably will succeed, better get a new one.
Good Luck"

,jorrell0733,2010-08-13T19:35Z,"Re: Georgelucian89. There is no need for any additional software for windows 7 if u are using 4gb of memory or more. If your running 4gb or less install win7 32bit, if your using 4gb or more or memory then use the 64bit version."
,vogue.war,2010-08-13T20:17Z,"I really wouldn't bother with this..... I installed and the file system was completely corrupt. I even wasted my time uninstalling and reinstalling about 3 or 4 times until I wiped my HD and installed Ubuntu. 

I don't know if it was a particular problem with my computer or HDD, but I don't think that's so when I've been starting fresh every time. 

I don't know, you may find it works for you."
