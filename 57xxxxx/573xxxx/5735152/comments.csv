I'd been up 24 hours, so I was sort of rushing. =P"
,GuybrushUlyssesThreepwood,2010-08-03T00:14Z,"Also, the games fit onto three DVDs, for those that want to back them up for later installation.

DVD 1: Monkey Island I, II, and III.

DVD 2: Monkey Island IV and Tales of Monkey Island.

DVD 3: Everything else."
