The German Third Reich had the most technologically advanced and innovative weapons industries in World War II, with aircraft, tanks and bombs that could match and beat anything else in the World. What is less known is the extent of Germany's secret weapons development. Germany pioneered rocket and jet-propelled aircraft, the pilotless plane, long-range rocket technology and 'robot bombs', and the world's first super-heavy tanks. Many of these weapons had a real impact on the course of the war. Following the invasion of the Soviet Union and the realization that the war could continue for years, Hitler put great resources into the development of new and technologically advanced weaponry, in the belief that the production of 'wonder weapons' were the key to winning the war.
