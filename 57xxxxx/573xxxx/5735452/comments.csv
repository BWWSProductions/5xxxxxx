,BluForestFires,2010-09-02T02:05Z,this torrent also doesn't actually have the alternate mix of Ladybug that is on We Are Not Alone. they just threw in the mix from the So Cold EP. the Japanese version of WANA has an earlier mix of Ladybug.
,spikerdude,2010-09-03T01:32Z,"Alright, thanks for the comments. I'll look around for the alternate mix of Ladybug. If I can find it,I'll change the folders.If I can't, I'll probably still end up doing it. :o"
