,addumb,2012-04-21T04:21Z,this torrent has no files???
,KESThai,2012-06-05T07:32Z,Of course it has a file...my thanks to the uploader and all the seeders.....
,KESThai,2012-06-06T01:29Z,"Best viewed at 4:3 aspect ratio rather than the default 16:9. I hate watching short, dumpy people (Leo at 16:9 looks like one of the 7 dwarfs). And cars that don't have round wheels must be an awful bumpy ride.
