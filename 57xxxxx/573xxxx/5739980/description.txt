Music : Soundtrack : Lossless


If you liked the music in the documentary series, you'll like this cd. If you haven't seen A History of Britain, then I guess the best word to describe the music is "unique."

Much is based on traditional tunes such as "The Three Ravens" and the performers include John Harle, Emma Kirkby and Elvis Costello.


Enjoy and Seed!!
