From the back of the DVD:

On August 28, 1993, metal superstars Iron Maiden and horror illusionist Simon Drake combined to create the most macabre musical event of all time: Raising Hell. In this first and only live rock concert with a horror movie setting, Raising Hell celebrates lead singer Bruce Dickinson's final performance with Iron Maiden. The band's electrifying concert performance, taped live at Pinewood Studios, London, incorporates blood curdling illusions and seventeen classic Iron Maiden songs, four not seen on the original pay-per-view broadcast. In a 100+ minutes, "Iron Maiden Raises Hell" in a performance that will live on forever.
