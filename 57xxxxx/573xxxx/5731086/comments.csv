,l0k1__,2010-08-04T12:07Z,"glad to finally get this out there held onto this lot for almost 2 years now. just disappointed with how little else in the genres are being put out there and since i have enuf band to up this almost 4x over i hope i get a few ppl seeding along with me, i'll hold this initial seeding as long as it takes to get another 5 seeds."
,l0k1__,2010-08-08T08:26Z,this is such a huge torrent.... pls pls help seed it! at least for a while. thx :)
,l0k1__,2010-08-09T12:21Z,i'm shutting down my seeding of this torrent for a day. and if i don't have another seed in a few days time after i go back online i'm just gonna quit seeding it. there's been at least 3 leeches who have got full copies of this now and nobody has stuck around to help me seed it. maybe if i just pop up every so often people might realise they need to chip in to help keep this live. kinda sad that ppl don't realise this is a cooperative venture rather than a free lunch.
,l0k1__,2010-08-11T04:26Z,thx to all the ppl helping seed :) hope you all are enjoying the musics also :D
