A huge collection (35gb) of flac rips of albums from numerous artists in several genres, aggrotech, ambient, experimental, dark electro, stuff that escapes categorisation like 'snog'. by no means comprehensive but most of this stuff can't be had on torrents in flac format, much of it not at all. want to get it out there finally.
