100% to legit to quit"
,uluvme,2010-08-02T05:40Z,Why is the size so large?
,bigghead81,2010-08-02T05:43Z,100% fake
,n00bOfTheTorrents,2010-08-02T06:06Z,"enonash is retarded. WMV isn't the only video container. This is an MKV contain an h264 video file, and ac3 audio file. Which is also why it's so large, uluvme."
,Nobody316,2010-08-02T06:49Z,Some people need to get their head out of their asses and do some research. Come to the site and you will see it's not fake. eonash you are the dumbest idiot i have seen on here if you don't know that there is more than just wmv container you should get the fuck off the internet dumb ass.

,hanako,2010-08-02T07:36Z,"um guys that this torrent is NOT fake is exactly what eonash was saying.
don't go around telling people they're the dumbest idiot when you don't take the time to read properly."
,hanako,2010-08-02T07:36Z,that said thanks a lot of this torrent!
,necival,2010-08-02T08:09Z,"thanks TZ! the video is great... but some reason the audio isnt working, any ideas anyone? i have a mac... using perian & quicktime... i can usually open mkv files."
,Sayvara,2010-08-02T13:49Z,"Broken in DivX Player and Windows Media Player: no sound. Works in VLC. 

Also, why is this so short? The show is normally about 55 minutes. And the file is smaller than usual.

Where is the ""PROPER"" version?"
,mr_foofer,2010-08-02T19:16Z,"As usual IMMERSE fucks it up again.

Not worth downloading.  Wait for a PROPER or try a smaller SD release."
,infermon,2010-08-03T02:14Z,No sound in perian qucktime plug-in.  Works in VLC.
,cnthwz,2010-08-03T07:52Z,"if you have no sound when playing back, use mkvmerge to remove the 3rd track in the mkv."
