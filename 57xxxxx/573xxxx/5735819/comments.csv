,omegafox84,2010-08-03T04:45Z,i know this one doesn't compare to the original but figured i'd put it up anyways.
,punisher_latin,2010-08-03T06:16Z,thank u for this movie!!!!!!!!!
,omegafox84,2010-08-03T07:07Z,you're very welcome!
[T],ctang,2010-08-03T18:09Z,"ya your right, the first one is so much better but this is still worth the download"
,omegafox84,2010-08-03T22:40Z,"the best part, for me, is when Harry gets a melted Hershey's bar all over the bathroom and the dad (Bob Saget) sees it and flips out."
[T],ctang,2010-08-04T18:48Z,"i think that is the only good part that i can think of

man this sucks that your torrents are anonymous now...a lot of mine are now other>other like this one is but still say they are uploaded by me...dang you tpb...i hope it gets fixed...or at least i hope we can edit our torrents soon so that i can manually change my torrents back to video>dvdr"
,omegafox84,2010-08-04T20:35Z,they're most likely fixing all the trusted and vip members first. i probably won't upload anything else if it's just gonna be labeled anonymous. hope it gets sorted out soon.
[T],ctang,2010-08-04T23:17Z,"i just uploaded beerfest and mine says that it was uploaded by me and not anonymous but like you said, it could be because im trusted"
[T],ctang,2010-08-07T05:58Z,i love how all the good ntsc dvd-r uploaders are all coming together to form a friendship and small community!! :)
,omegafox84,2010-08-07T07:00Z,"@ctang: me too! :)

i just wish TPB didn't have so many problems this often. has this site always been off and on like this? or am i cursed and it just started when i finally decide to start uploading? lol."
[T],ctang,2010-08-07T22:51Z,i cant remember tpb ever being this buggy.... i have only been a member for about a year but have been on it for the better part of 6 years downloading...i dont care how buggy it has recently been bc its the best torrent site out there...i come here b4 demonoid

,omegafox84,2010-08-12T20:48Z,"@everyone: this site continues to have malware/trojans throughout many of its pages & several technical errors. due to these ongoing problems here on TPB, i will not be posting any new torrents or visiting this site as frequently as in the past. i hope to return when these problems are sorted out. thank you for your understanding."
[T],ctang,2010-08-16T22:55Z,"omegafox:  you should be fine uploading movies because you only send information and arent downloading anything...if your paranoid then dont download because thats when you receive things from others (like viruses and stuff like that, along with what you wanted)....on a positive note, i just got the next karate kid and will be doing it since you put the first 3 up...i also got date night and the naked mile and have them at the top of my list"
,omegafox84,2010-08-16T23:48Z,"i was getting virus alerts just browsing through regular pages. those ""hackers"" must have altered a few of the ads as the alerts were coming from them. since my last comment i've figured out just to block the http and it keeps them from loading and installing malware. i think i'll take your advice, upload something and see how it goes. thanks man. definitely would like to see Next Karate Kid and Date Night."
