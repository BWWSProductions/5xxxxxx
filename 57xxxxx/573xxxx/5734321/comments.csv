Slightly mystified as to why the MP3 is only in joint stereo, which isn't actually real stereo at all.
You obviously appreciate sound quality, otherwise you wouldn't have offered the FLAC option.
Of the 3 MP3 formats, Joint is the worst, it spreads the stereo signal over both the left and right and reudces high frequencies and separation. (so called) Stereo is better, but still not with independant left and right channels, the only way to get full quality and proper stereo is with Dual Channel (sometimes called dual stereo).
Just try it, and instantly hear the difference."

,g8aso,2010-08-03T09:53Z,"OK mate, glad you didn't take offence, this Katy Perry tart needs a serious seeing to.............. and not by a mincing twat like Russel Brand!"
,matthew99144,2010-08-03T12:09Z,"g8aso: alright so next time with any further uploads I will ENSURE to encode mp3 in Stereo and NOT joint stereo, and will make sure there is no sacrificing in audio quality ;)"

Ignore g8aso: compressed audio at the same bitrate produce a higher quality sound when encoded in Joint than in Stereo.

This is because at a constant bitrate, a song encoded in Stereo spends more bits on channel separation than in Joint. Since you only have 320kb to play with, Joint will allow you a lot more kbp/s than Stereo to allocate toward more important things that affect sound quality, resulting in a higher-fi sound, almost every time."
