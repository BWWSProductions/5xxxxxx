,Searcher5,2010-09-19T09:24Z,Whats this rar business??? I thought we were over it??? The only way its to be done is each episode is individual so we can choose which one for download in seperated instances... for those who have a few eps dont want to waste bandwidth downloading the same stuff over and over again. NO ONE can afford to waste BANDWIDTH till with have propagatory redundency world wide with 200gb links.
