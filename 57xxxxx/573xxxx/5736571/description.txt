KiNGDOM NOTES
Well, Did a little bit on this like fixed AR, lowered the blue as much as I could without discoloring other portions. I added a little sharpness to the script, also increased the brightness and Gamma. The audio seemed low so I raised it to 120%. Video and audio really wasnt all that bad to begin with, just needed a lil more and a lil less.
