Is this something i need to download extra?"

,scrdppy,2010-08-01T01:11Z,"people might want to know that the difference between the razor1911 iso and the reloaded iso is as follows:
the razor1911 iso has two extra (irrelevant) files:
\autorun.inf
\disc.ico
and an extra folder (where the crack-only is):
\Razor1911\ (with those 3 files in it)

and the folder:
\Starcraft II Installer.app\ has the same contents(all files were md5sum checked) but different name on the razor1911 iso, named ""\Installed.app\""

the reloaded iso has a folder ""\Crack\"" where the reloaded crack-only obviously resides

so, in conclusion: you'd need only one of the ISOs , all files were md5-sum checked to be identical on both ISOs, only the cracks were different (naturally, two different teams)

personally, I get access violation running the razor1911 crack Keytro.exe in win 7 64bit (without having updated sc2 online yet, doesn't work for some reason) but the reloaded crack(and iso) worked perfectly (finished the game, 25/26 missions) - oh and the secret mission won't unlock even though I went on the blizz mission and found it, I guess I need to redo the campaign from start and don't forget to wipe that yellow-controlled building to unlock it;

on the keytro.exe , it blinks my screen, gives the error message, when I click close then it blinks again (tried in compatib mode, and I'm in admin mode since UAC is disabled)

So they are the same?(reloaded and razor)
Only difference u can play skirmisch mode without extra crack?

And what about the missions? u said u played 25/26 missions with reloaded crack and u couldnt unlock 'secret mission' meaning 26/26?
This crack does unlock that?"

,qwerty17,2010-08-01T03:10Z,"Sorry for my Double Post

My SC2 works now 
this is what i did

1.Crack this SC2-Liberty using Reloaded's Crack 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5723363/Starcraft_2_Wings_of_Liberty_Reloaded_Crack_Only

2.Then Crack it using Razor 1911's Crack
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5730029/Starcraft_II_Wings_Of_Liberty_Proper-Razor1911-CrackOnly

and this is what i did for the MAPS

a folder inside

C:\ProgramData\Blizzard Entertainment\Battle.net\Cache
or just directly inside the
C:\ProgramData\Blizzard Entertainment\Battle.net\Cache folder?

If in case it was the inside another folder, what was the name of the folder containing it?[/quote]
Inside of the folder chache you will see a bunch of folders

00
0a
0b
...
etc

at this point u have to use the search system, look for the extension *.s2ma in the chache folder to find them, the maps will have names like:

0e639dfeb6bbe18f5a859b5059dd6e296a7a19d1c902f538c250545fc7dd5658.s2ma

Copy all the maps to a folder in your desktop, then u can rename it from *.s2ma to *.sc2map

the best method i found was using a batch renaming
you can do this opening the notepad and writing this parameters

rename *.s2ma *.sc2map

and save it as .bat
example: SC2Maprename.bat

then put the .bat file in to the folder where u put all the maps and execute it
so now you have all the maps whit extension *.sc2map :D
and now u have to open 1 by 1 with the editor map and look for the name of the map and change it
to see the name of each map in the editor go to

Map --> Mapinfo


in the ""info"" tab u have to change the ""Locale"" from enGB to enUS to see the name of the map (in enGB dont show it i dont know why, in enUS and the rest of the countrys it showed)


Well i hope this will helped you"

the secret mission should unlock on the Blitz mission, destroying some passive-controlled building (yellow circled) forgot the details, but I didn't know this when I played the campaign, so I finished campaign and then I had that list of all missions, trying to find the 26th mission (25/26 I played) well I ended up playing 2-3 more missions which I hadn't played (because of my choices I made during campaign obviously) and I still had 25/26, but after playing the Blitz mission (inside that mission it said secret mission unlocked, and at end of it on stats) but after mission ended, it didn't auto-start the secret mission, and I couldn't find it in the list (since the list of missions is the only one I can see after finishing the campaign - unless I'm missing something obvious) hence, I figured I'm screwd so I have to play the campaign again and make sure not to miss destroying that building in the Blitz mission - so I figure by doing that, the next mission would be the secret mission - I don't know yet since I haven't re-played the campaign until there... in progress;

the razor crack absolutely does not work FOR ME (win7 64bit ati video card, DEP disabled - Data Execution Protection, admin mode since UAC is disabled) but the razor crack worked perfectly so far *well note that razor said the reloaded crack didn't allow skirmish or something - since I don't do that I dno*

on the razor crack sc2_copy.exe works - what it does it unpacks the battle.net cached files (whatever they are for - account and stuff I guess) into c:\ProgramData\Blizzard Entertainment\     folder, note that sc2_copy.dat is a pkzip aka winzip file.... for whoever cares.

execute sc2 (dont worry about the battle.net ignore it) click on play as guest choose either of the 3 razor's profile then there you can start campaign or versus ai(skirmish) in single player button at the top while it loads wait for about a minute or two until it loads all the maps completely then its done and have fun!..."

,Wolfik.cz,2010-09-22T11:56Z,"Hi
To everybody who still can't get it run, try my modified king03jeff's process. 

!!! Tested on Win XP 32, Win 7 home.
!!! Campaign runs ok, saves loads etc.
!!! Skirmish don't work. 

Here is how to do it.
You need the following:
1. starcraft 2 installer/iso
2. razor1911 crack
3. reloaded crack

Steps: 
1. uninstall any previous version of Starcr 2
2. restart
3. install the game (I installed from Razor iso)
4. skip the Activation when asked
5. update normaly from Blizzard!!!
6. run Razor crack called ""sc2_copy.exe"" and wait till it's done
7. from Reloaded crack dir, copy ONLY the file ""Update.bat"" and ""Updates"" dir to your game directory. Rewrite all files if asked. 
8. run ""Update.bat"" in your game directory you have just copied
9. It will crash after few percents/seconds -- no problem! Just follow the next steps...
10. now, from Reloaded crack dir, copy ALL OTHER DIRECTORIES AND FILES to your game dir (so I mean WITHOUT Updates dir and Update.bat file!) and rewrite all files when asked
11. There you go, it's done!

Hope it will help to somebody. After million tries or so, it finally worked for me and 5 other friends (computers). 
Remember, if you would eventually like the game, buy it! Support the effort and quality work done. 
Peace. "

No need for other programs like the SC2allinone.
Fully working Campaign and Skirmish modes on the game itself plus the latest patches(1.1.3).


To everyone having problems this is how i did it:
1. Install any fresh copy of StarCraft II Wings of Liberty (Fresh install to remove all the previous cracks).
2. After installing stop the game from updating.
3. Run SC2-1.1.3-enGB-patch from the download.
4. Run Keygen as Administrator. (THIS IS IMPORTANT TO GET THE GUEST ACCOUNT WORKING!)
To run as admin on XP simply shift+double click.
Click OK then QUIT.
5. Run sc2_copy.
6. To play the game, use the SC2Switcher.exe located at the install folder starcraftII>support to prevent the game from updating.

A COUPLE OF NOTES: 

1) It cannot be stressed enough how important it is that you disconnect your connection BEFORE installation. Simply using a firewall to block access is no good -- the installation checks for an active IP address and will lock-up the install process if it finds you're merely trying to deny it internet access. Personally, I used the ""ipconfig /release"" command to temporarily get rid of my IP, then ""ipconfig /renew"" after the installation. 

2) And just to be on the safe side of things -- ALWAYS run the SC2switcher executable in the Support folder rather the main Starcraft II executable. "
