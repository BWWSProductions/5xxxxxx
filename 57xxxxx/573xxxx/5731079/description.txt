The young Masahiro is the grandson of the famed Abe no Seimei, the great 
onmyouji. However, having lost his sixth sense and the ability to see 
spirits, Masahiro struggles to prove himself that he is more then just 
"Seimei's grandson". Out of nowhere, a mononoke begins to follow Masahiro 
around, who then decides to call the mononoke Mokkun. Without realising, 
Mokkun is actual the fearsome Touda, or Guren as Seimei has named him, 
one of Seimei's twelve shikigamis. With the assistance of Mokkun, Masahiro 
begins to battle the spirits haunting their city, and perhaps develop his 
innate ability that could even surpass Seimei. 
Based on the novel by Yuuki Hikaru.
