,skygear,2010-08-03T07:33Z,i SEED
,425paul,2010-08-03T16:45Z,"Thanks, I've been looking for this update."
,Zzznorch,2010-08-03T18:45Z,What is contained in this map image?  At 1.16GB it is small compared to previous releases.  I am guessing Mexico is missing.  2011.10 with all North American locations is 1.23GB.
,Newb787,2010-08-03T22:56Z,"dats correct. mexico is missing. the original person who created this map also sued GMaptool as indicated in the on the MAP INFO page on my Nuvi.

this will work for now. Hopefully, someone will be able to know how to select save to pc from Garmin instead of just downloading it and then butchering it.  upload the full version and knows . 

skygear is just uploading it, he didnt create this butchererd .img file."
,denniz94,2010-08-03T22:58Z,thanks man
,Newb787,2010-08-03T23:13Z,"remember, this is NOT the full mapsource version. u cant plot what u want on your PC.

this does NOT have junction views

this does NOT have MEXICO"
,legendc,2010-08-04T00:25Z,"Go get mu torrent at Demonoid. Full MapSource version but no 3D nor JVC files.
torrent name: City Navigator North America NT 2011.20"
,Shazam_777,2010-08-04T03:28Z,Forget about Demonoid. the uploader has a very slow connection and turns it off as well. he should get bitched slapped for that. 
,skygear,2010-08-04T17:48Z,sorry guys i'll upload a full mexico and jcv 3d later this evening
,BriMac1950,2010-08-29T03:29Z,I've never had so much trouble trying to figure out how to open a torrent. I think it's easier to just pay Garmin the $119 lifetime fee and get ALL the NA and EU maps....for ever!!
,samsnead77,2010-09-06T23:34Z,"What if you own a Kenwood indash entertainment player that uses garmin as its navigation componenet.

Can that be upgraded also?"
,moonray2,2010-09-13T04:41Z,"If you own a Kenwood DNX-7100 and it keeps rebooting on the start screen with this file, upgrade the GPS firmware to Version 2.90 from the Garmin website (it says it is for allowing the use of HDSD cards). Then it will work just fine.  "
,pripoi,2010-09-15T06:36Z,"So this seems to be a junk file, right? I'm surprised nobody else said it in the comments.

I didn't notice all the negatives on the quality meter up there, doh."
