Will be away from the torrent scene for awhile. You all have a good summer =) and thanks for all the good seeders out there. thanks again!! 
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-05T04:06Z,"I'm sorry to hear that you are going to be away for awhile. I know me and a whole lot of people are fans of your work and I thank you for all of your help. I have also made the mistake of trying to hard-code subs while encoding for PiZ. That's why I always hard-code the subs first and then encode it for PiZ. Otherwise the subs are all messed up, example you can see parts of the subs. Anyway, Thanks again.

BTW, I will be more than happy to take requests from people, as I have filled some already.

Also, sorry OOO, I don't mean to spam on your torrents. "
