Virtualization and Forensics
By Diane Barrett, Greg Kipper

Description

Virtualization creates new and difficult challenges for forensic investigations. Operating systems and applications running in virtualized environments often leave few traces, yielding little evidence with which to conduct an investigation.

Virtualization and Forensics offers an in-depth view into the world of virtualized environments and the implications they have on forensic investigations. Part I explains the process of virtualization and the different types of virtualized environments. Part II details how virtualization interacts with the basic forensic process, describing the methods used to find virtualization artifacts in dead and live environments as well as identifying the virtual activities that affect the examination process. Part III address advanced virtualization issues, such as the challenges of virtualized environments, cloud computing, and the future of virtualization. After reading this book, you'll be equipped to conduct investigations in these environments with confidence.
