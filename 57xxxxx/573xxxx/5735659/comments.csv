Thanks."
,AAovies,2011-04-09T22:45Z,"I was just flagged by my ISP for downloading this. It is distributed by Miramax, which is a subsidiary of Disney. I've been finding that downloading any movies from a Disney company is dangerous. Just thought I would let you know."
,upstatekid91,2011-04-11T07:08Z,"AAoovies, Disney doesnt own miramax anymore they sold it back in 2010. Soo your statement therefore doesn't make sense."
,AAovies,2011-04-14T02:44Z,"Regardless, I was flagged for downloading this. Be careful. "
,jenchai,2011-05-24T12:14Z,"@AAovies : There are hell lot Miramax movies on piratebay and there's been no problem regarding them. Its not Miramax or Disney, its your ISP. Here's a frigging advice. 

1. Don't download
or
2. Use Perr Guardian or IP blocker."
,jenchai,2011-05-24T12:15Z,Peer Guardian
,juandh,2011-05-27T21:28Z,"The people behind Peer Guardian stopped working on it a LOOONG time ago and recently released a new project called Peer Block. I would go with that instead since they are actively upgrading it, unlike Peer Guardian. 

Also, thank you so much GreatMagician and everyone else associated with Kingdom Releases. You guys release nothing but quality and your efforts are greatly appreciated."

(mind you it was my second notice) but still, this torrent is being tracked. great as this film is, especially on blu-ray, it's not worth the hassle."
