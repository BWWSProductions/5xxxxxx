VideoUpLink provides a drag and drop interface for uploading one
or more videos to a Facebook page. Video files can be dragged
from an iPhoto library, the Media Browser, or from the Finder
anywhere on your drive. A title and description for each video
can be added using the new table view. Login to Facebook with the
Login button, and then click Upload. An accurate progress bar
will appear for each video as it is processed.
