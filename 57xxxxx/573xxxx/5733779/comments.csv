,orannisalpha,2010-08-05T22:37Z,"well aren't you all just a bunch of fucking idiots.  arguing about ""what language is stronger"" and ""what language is beautiful""  Its just a fucking language you idiots.  Its just how people talk.  And its in Spanish because people that speak Spanish watch movies too.  Thats not something unique to you you fucking moron.  Go fuck yourself in the ass with a copy of Rosetta Stone you cock sucking piece of worthless shit."
