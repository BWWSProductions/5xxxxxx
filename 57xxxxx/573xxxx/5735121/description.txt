Installation:

1.Unpack
2.copy files to the correct FSX folder using common sense
3.Add scenery manually to your scenery library using common sense
4.I think you have to add vistamare to main fsx folder as thats where mine is, it controls the traffic!!!

DONT KNOW HOW????? TAKE A LOOK HERE!! (THIS IS FOR WINDOWS 7 64 BIT) BUT WILL WORK ON ALL FSX WINDOWS VERSIONS!!!

This is everything that i got from the .exefile if this doesnt work then i dont know what else to suggest!! Just use common sense when installing into the right folders!!! I think finding the right folder for the world/scenry gibraltar file might be hard!!!



Enjoy!!!!!
