Jason, a fearless sailor and explorer, returns to the kingdom of Thessaly after a 20-year voyage to make his rightful claim to the throne.

Jason and his crew must overcome incredible obstacles including a 100-foot bronze giant, the venomous Hydra, a huge creature with the heads of seven snakes,
and a battle with an army of skeletons.
