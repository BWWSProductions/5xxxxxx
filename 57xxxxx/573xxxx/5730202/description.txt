NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Toy story 3 TC

Sources used Toy.Story.3.2010.TC.720p.x264-CiRiTH and Toy.Story.3.HDRip.Smallrip....thanks to both 
Right what we did first was taken both audio files and mux them together to create a full audio track.
Oh i believe cirith used prisms line so thanks to them aswell 
What we did was use the first 1min 5 sec and all the end credit audio off the smallrip release....now the end credits is in 
two langs...the audio track playing is in english but the spoke voices during the outtakes are non english.
Onto the video for this we made a little script that ivtc'd the video,white balance,brightness and contrast + sharpen....we 
also then used the rgbeq in vdub to balance the colours more as they seemed a little off and also used the de-ghosting filter,never
used it before and might have not made much of a difference,but we'll let you decide on that.

Anyway we know there is alots of good releases already of this and most won't want/need this ......but we've still had pms
asking so ....here ya go.
Enjoy 

Enjoy
