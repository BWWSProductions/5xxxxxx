,onegreatguy,2010-08-01T00:10Z,Is this only playable on 3d sets or is it downgraded to 2d?
[T],insinuendo,2010-08-01T00:45Z,You don't need a 3D TV to watch this. You need  2 coloured glasses however.
[T],insinuendo,2010-08-01T01:08Z,All you need is two coloured glasses. Where is my first comment..? Oh well...
,cyjambo,2010-08-05T14:48Z,Do you know what color combination of 3D glasses you need to watch this? Thx!

Why would we want anaglyph version of this?
You should put that in the title or description!"
,amnios,2011-10-08T14:25Z,"Thanks to all the comments who said NOT TO DOWNLOAD THIS REDBLUE CRAP...

I took your advise and did not download.

I remember anaglyph on cereal boxes back in the 80's.... it sucked real hard then and still sucks.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD DO NOT SEED"
