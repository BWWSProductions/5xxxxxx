,blakp,2010-08-05T00:53Z,"ooo, i second @bara-d. several of your torrents will not load on the psp (like ""labrynth"" for instance) but will play on the ipod touch. any ideas? other than that thank you. and damn we'll miss you. your torrents are badass!"
[T],on.off.on,2010-08-05T01:08Z,@blakp i have no clue man they are all encoded below the standards of psp and according to that they should all be compatible with PSP's...  oddness over all lol I seriously do not know what to do lol
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-05T03:50Z,"I'm sorry to hear that you are going to be away for awhile. I know me and a whole lot of people are fans of your work and I thank you for all of your help. I have also made the mistake of trying to hard-code subs while encoding for PiZ. That's why I always hard-code the subs first and then encode it for PiZ. Otherwise the subs are all messed up, example you can see parts of the subs. Anyway, thanks again. I hope you have a good holiday.  (^_^)

@ Everyone HR, PT, & OOO Fans/Followers - I will be more than happy to take requests from people, as I have filled some for people. I will do just about any TV-Show, any Movie, Music Video, XXX. I am working on several seasons/series, like  -  Eureka, Eastbound and Down, Entourage, The IT Crowd, Covert Affairs, The Hard Times Of RJ Berger, Warren The Ape, Scoundrels, Rubicon, White Collar, Lie To Me, Mongrels, The Glades, Rookie Blue, Memphis Beat, Rizzoli and Isles, The Life and Times of Tim, Pranked, Identity (2010), Sherlock, Unnatural History, Royal Pains, Persons Unlnown, Mercy (Hospital), Cougar Town, Tangle, Leverage, Burn Notice, Hung, and movie packs. But before I up them, I need to know that enough people want them. Oh, and until OOO gets back I would be more than happy to do Futurama."
