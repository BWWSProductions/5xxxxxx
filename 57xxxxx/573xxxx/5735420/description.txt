    Danny Cornish, a sort of stateless man who arranges art exhibits, is     
    called from Tel Aviv to Paris with the news that a great uncle has       
    died, in Birobidjan, the autonomous Jewish zone in Russia, leaving       
    him a valuable art collection and the hand of a huge sculpture of a      
    Golem. The uncle's will instructs Danny to find the rest of the          
    statue, so Danny, who speaks no Russian, embarks on a trip that takes    
    him (and the Golem's hand) to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Siberia,       
    fumbling with hotel clerks, taxi drivers, and bureaucrats, following     
    leads, and making discoveries about myth, story telling, art, and        
    hope.
