*********************************

Enjoy!

Set 9 Bonus:

1. CBDA comics update pack
26 comics updated

2. DD US One pagers CBDA collection

(You can see examples of how I did scanlations of the 
European DD one pagers as well as one example of a
re-coloured one pager comic.  You can expect this collection 
to be updated, as I fix up more one page DD US comics.)

3. Happy Birthday CB order form for 
DVD pdf
 
4. 01 Donald Duck Abbeville ReConstruction CBDA

(Here is the way that Abbeville was supposed to publish CB comics!
I just need to get the US Abbeville book done to finish the 
trilogy.  I'm releasing one DD CB Abbeville book per set.)

5. WDC&S 215 The Milkman 1990 CBDA

*************

Also, I found this very nice CB interview video on this website.
istantanee.rai.it/cellulosa/barks/


Set 10 will be ready in 1-2 months approx.
Hopefully, I'll get this set done sooner.

*************

I am still sorting out Set 6 for the comics request list.


Set 10 will have the fewest recent HQ comics, since
most of the comics were only reprinted in soft cover
graphic albums. I have the WDSC graphic
albums on hand, but I'm not willing to
bend them all out of shape to scan.
Any suggestions?

iii. maybe, US life and times

**********

The excellent free disney comics website is available if you just
want to read the un-cropped comics online.

Much thanks goes to that guy who has posted many more recent
scans of wdc&s stories. It gives me a quite a few more comics
to update though.

The CBDA collection will be complete, 
but if you can find better scans than posted within this 
collection, then please leave a message and post up your comic scans.

I will update this request list as I go along.
Thanks for helping!
