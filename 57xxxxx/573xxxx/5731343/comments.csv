,kaarma33,2010-09-02T21:14Z,"28 comics to trim for CBDA Set 10.

I'm putting together A Day in a Duck's Life Daan Jippes version from the European DD collection.  Looks good, but not great due to scan quality and the difficulties of scanlation.

If you see any CBDA comics that are really off, like WDCS 034 Good Deeds, then you can post a pm.  So, I can make a fixed version.

The extras are another story.
DD 45 A Day in a Duck's Life Daan Jippes scanlation did not come out so well.  The Netherlands comic scan was low quality, so I tried a little too much gauss blur and a photo sharpen to smooth out the pixellation.  I might re-do that one.  

I'm working on a ""Seals are so Smart"" scanlation because the fellow with the free disney comics scan has posted WDCS Good deeds 034 new version which looks great!  
The CB stories that I would like to see with recent high quality scans are ""luck of the north"" and ""the old castle's secret.   Anybody, anybody?
Thanks!

I'll do as many one pagers as I can, but some of the one pagers are low quality.  

The US in color updated scan is just to add in the articles and updates to the book cover.  

I'll keep working on this until it's ready."
