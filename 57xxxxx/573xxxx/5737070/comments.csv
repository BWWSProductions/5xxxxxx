I can't mount it with either Daemon Lite, MagicDisc or Alco120, the virtual drive doesn't work properly so there's no way for me try any player as those 3 different players I have neither can reach the mounted device.

Please help somebody.. ;("

Use ISOburner (v.2.8 works) and extract, then play the ""yourgreatmoviefilename.m2ts"" with VLC player.

,evilmonkey99,2011-08-09T04:36Z,"ATTENTION! This file is CORRUPT!
I extracted the ISO and began watching the movie successfully however in the middle of the movie it starts the movie at the beginning again so pretty much the movie is half of the movie and then the first half of the movie recorded again back to back.
Whoever made this, recorded it fucked up. dont download this. you have been warned. 
BTW i have a lot of experience with these bluray files whether they be mkv or m2ts or ts. "
