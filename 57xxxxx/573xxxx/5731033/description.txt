"You Took the Words Right out of My Mouth" (also known as "You Took the Words Right out of My Mouth (Hot Summer Night)") is the first single by the American musician Meat Loaf in his solo career. It is a track off his 1977 album Bat out of Hell, written by Jim Steinman.

Steve Popovich reportedly listened to the intro to the song and it became a key factor of his accepting Bat out of Hell for Cleveland International Records. The ultimate irony was that Meat Loaf, Steinman, and the band tried for a year or so to get the record label with their music, and how they allegedly did so was a 45-second recording with no singing at all.

According to his autobiography, Meat Loaf asked Jim to write a song that wasn't 15 or 20 minutes long, and, in Meat Loaf's words, a "pop song." His autobiography also dates the writing of the song to 1975, the song reportedly being a key factor in Meat and Jim deciding to do an album together.

When released, it wasn't too successful as a single, because critics condemned it for being too "theatrical." The track was never fully noticed until it became a B-side to "Paradise by the Dashboard Light."

Bat Out of Hell is the second album by American rock musician Meat Loaf, released in October 1977. Selling approximately 200,000 copies per year as of 2010, it is the fifth best-selling album worldwide, having sold 43 million copies worldwide . Rolling Stone magazine ranked it at number 343 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2003. Its musical style is influenced by composer Jim Steinman's appreciation of Richard Wagner, Phil Spector and Bruce Springsteen.

This album's title also became the title for two more Meat Loaf albums. Steinman produced the 1993 album, Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell. Desmond Child produced the 2006 album, Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose.
