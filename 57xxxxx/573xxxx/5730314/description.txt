Was rewatching Hard Rock Zombies for the first time in years today. I heard some of the songs and knew I had to have the soundtrack, I immediately checked for a torrent but couldn't find anything, but after about an hour of searching online, I found a download for it. After listening to it and verifying it was good, I figured I'd make a torrent out of it because I know other people are wanting it too.




And no, your torrent program isn't messing up, there's really only five songs on here. 




Here they are:




Paul Sabu:   "Angel's First"



Paul Sabu:   "Cassie's Song"



Paul Sabu:    "Shake it Out"



Paul Sabu:    "Street Angel"



Paul Sabu:     "Zombie Revenge"






Enjoy and seed! :D
