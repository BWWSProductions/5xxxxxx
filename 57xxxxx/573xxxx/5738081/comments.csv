,jbscythe,2010-10-15T03:13Z,anybody out there looking for Star Wars - Force Commander pc game? here it is full and no install or crack needed. just extract and play. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5887563/Star_Wars_-_Force_Commander.rar
,andyabomb,2010-10-23T12:30Z,"Okay, I did everything you told me to. I downloaded everything, I extracted the .rar folder to another location, just like it said, and I clicked on ""LEGOStarWarsSaga.exe"", and this  system error came up:

""The program can't start because d3dx9_35.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.""

Not too sure, is there a crack I need to get or something? There's another .rar folder inside the first .rar folder I extracted which has another LEGOStarWarsSaga.exe in it... 

Any help? Thanks."
,onizuma13,2010-12-09T11:31Z,"Ok so the game is good, and its a great torrent.

Or well thats what I would say but I have a problem.  Other than having to download 3DAnalyzer to play because of the pixel shader crap.(which was annoying but didn't bother me much)  The game plays fine throughout episode 1 but when I got to chapter 1 of episode 2 the game crashes.

Now I don't know if its because of the 3DAnalyzer or what but yeah.

Has anyone else had this problem or crashes? And does anyone know how to fix this problem??

If not i'd suggest just buying the game.

Also on a side note the crack file is useless.  It played fine without it.  IN FACT if you use the crack it tells you to use the original disk."

You just download it, extract and play!

but you may have to put it in med settings.

,seml4,2011-06-08T08:04Z,"I have a problem with the game! I'm able to run LEGO Harry Potter yrs 1-4 on my comp but I'm not able to run this game! How could that be? LEGO Star Wars Complete Saga came much before LEGO Harry Potter & it should run just fine on my system. When I launch LEGO Star Wars Complete Saga, it says that my system doesn't have pixel shaders 2.0 & the game will now quit. I've checked & my system does have pixel shaders 2.0!!!"
,expose13,2011-07-04T13:08Z,"If only they could all be this good. 
""Just unzip and play"" - I was calling bulls**t the whole time dling and unpzipping.

Great torrent, fast download.
