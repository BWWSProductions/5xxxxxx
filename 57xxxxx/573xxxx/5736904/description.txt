A ghostwriter hired to complete the memoirs of a former British prime minister uncovers secrets that put his own life in jeopardy.

Based on the novel by Robert Harris, where the main character resembles former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Harris was a strong supporter of Blair until he broke with him over Britain's participation in the war in Iraq and Blair's subordination to U.S. foreign policy. Directed by Roman Polanski, who was banned from the U.S. because of an event that occurred 32 years ago. Therefore, the film was shot in Germany and its depiction of Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts is recreated on the island of Sylt in the North Sea.

My ripping procedure now produces decent quality for such a long film compressed into just 700 MiB.
