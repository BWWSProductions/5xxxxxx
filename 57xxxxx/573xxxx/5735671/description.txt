The Newly Discovered Casebook of Sherlock Holmes was a BBC Radio 2 comedy series written by Tony Hare, and was first broadcast 1999.

The burlesque series was a comic pastiche of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. The series was recorded in front of a live audience and each 30 minute episode was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 at 1pm, making some of the rude, and occasionally crude jokes rather risquÃ© for the time of day.

Hudd, Emmett, and Whitfield had all worked together on the very long-running radio series The News Huddlines. Holland is a familiar voice in British comedy series, probably best known for his role as Spike Dixon, a holiday rep at the Maplin's holiday camp in Hi-de-Hi!

Hudd later appeared alongside Clive Merrison as Holmes, and Andrew Sachs as Doctor Watson in an original radio play in the series The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes in 2002.
