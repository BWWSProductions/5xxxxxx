I'm sorry I don't mean to hate on TPB (1 of the best sites ever) but it's just getting annoying cuz I can't even edit my torrents.

Anyways, I got a new seedbox, so expect several torrents a day at nice speeds. 

Also I haven't forgot about these requests Disturbing Behavior, Joe's Apartment, Undergrads, Clerks, and a few others, expect them in the next 24-48 hours.

As always Enjoy and please help me seed, cuz the more y'all seed the more torrents I can release faster. "
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-04T00:58Z,If anyone ever needs a reseed of any of my torrents just leave ma a comment in my latest torrent or send me an email  movi3sdir3ct@hotbox.ru
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-08T17:35Z,If anyone wants me to upload the rest of the episodes for this show send me an email or leave a comment on my latest torrent and I will gladly upload them.
