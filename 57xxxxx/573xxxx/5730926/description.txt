Hey guys. The last jeppesen books uploaded were mere images. This time I have OCRed (Optical Character Recognised) the images, zipped them using 7zip (u can get this small compression utility at www.filehippo.com) and now seeding. Bear with me as the upload sp is just about 50 KBs. At times the connections go off. But I will seed till I find at least 10 peers have 100%.

Please upzip using 7zip file manager or any other such prog which recognises the .7z format.

Both jeppesen and Oxford ATPL books are in the torrent.

Best wishes and happy landings.
