Other 
Fast real-time OpenGL graphics views (2D and 3D) with whiteboard controls for easy navigation 
Multipoint polygon and line editing down to vertex level 
No polygon limits 
Edit at different granularity - groups, objects, surfaces, vertices 
Simple and easy manipulation of selected components 
Powerful mouse selection with add/remove, select through and select closest components 
Surface and vertex loop selection 
Fast subdivision-surfaces with instant switch to view/hide subdivisions 
Extrusion and surface revolution of lines and surfaces 
Built-in fast OpenGL 3D renderer with adjustable field-of-view - instantly see results of your actions in 3D. Spin the model or switch into 'walk mode' for Quake-style control. 
Realtime mirror for symmetrical work 

Six boolean operations: Subtract, Intersect, Union, Cut-Away, Knife, Kife and Cut-away 
Manipulate one or more vertices 
snap together 
snap to grid 
smooth shape 
align to axis 
create new surfaces from 
create a 2D mesh using 
Manipulate one or more surfaces/polygons 
insert/remove vertices 
slice across surface/s 
make holes 
spike 
spline 
bevel 
triangulate 
flip 
divide 
combine 
flatten 
calculate surface-area 
change vertex order 
cut away into a new object 
Manipulate one or more objects 
extrude along a path (line) 
Revolve 
mirror 
reduce polygons 
merge surfaces/vertices into a single object 
fragment/explode - split surfaces into individual objects 
align to each other 
replicate

Object crease angle support - smooth shapes with sharp edges without the hard work 
Texture mapping support with switchable real-time rendering.

Switch a view into 'Inspect' mode to instantly see the 'clean' image 
Anti-alias 3D views for smoother images 
Snapshot images into the system clipboard for pasting into other software (Windows, Mac) 
Create new surfaces/objects around any selection (Convex hull) 
Objects can be named and searched for within a scene 
Attach URLs to objects for use in VRML files 
Attach string data to objects can be used as special directives for POV or renderman, or custom software 
Navigate/Zoom around the 2D views with cursor keys and other single key presses 
Hierarchical view window with drag/drop and locking/ hiding controls 
Hide/unhide objects for easier/faster editing of complicated scenes 
Headlight and up to 7 other positionable lights 
24-bit colour palette with adjustable diffuse; ambient; emissive; specular; shininess and transparency 
Adjustable 2D and 3D grid guide lines with grid-snap function 
Distances, positions and sizes of selected objects displayed on screen 
Scale a selection to a specific size 
Configurable to use external renderers such as Povray ( Tools->Render ) 
Flip a selection about X, Y or Z axis 
Remove duplicate vertices and surfaces ('optimize') 
3D mouse (3Dconnexion) support e.g. SpaceNavigator 
Multi-platform program - Windows, Linux and Mac OS X 
Fast and memory efficient, compact program binary. 
Software development kit and plugin interface.
