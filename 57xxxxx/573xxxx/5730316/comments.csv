,neo6488,2010-09-27T23:35Z,"Excellent condition 
a 10/10
v 10/10

I use mkv2vob to recode so ican play on my ps3 and they looked amazing.

two bits or warning if you recode them

1. The files will be huge like 700 mb for a 23 min episode
2. make sure you recode with the subtitles. these files dont have the subtitles imposed over the video they are actual subtitles so if you dont include them in a recode you will end up with characters speaking chinese (or japanese i really dont know). Just giving the warning cause i was kinda pissed off when i sat down and had no clue what was going on.

Oh yeah and if your like me and dont read this show is not in english but has subtitles."
,HeroSmero,2010-11-07T10:30Z,"I created an account just to reply to you Ace....

We get it, you're 12.  If you don't want to watch a higher quality anime in japanese, don't.  Also, if you are so worried about watching them in another format, you could convert them yourself (which btw, would likely increase file size dramatically).  Oh wait, you're way too busy bitching about a free anime of amazing quality that a bunch of people worked their asses off to make.... for free.  

Obviously you're so important that you shouldn't put any effort into anything aside from whining like a 6 year old who got his cake taken away on his birthday.  Grow up."
,AbraxsDsk,2010-11-16T07:59Z,"Ace.. are you serious? 1280 x 720 is absurd? ever heard of a little thing called 720p? or how about ""high definition"" for that matter? 
People happen to pay good money to get high definition monitors and tvs.. why you ask? oh maybe its to watch high definition content? 
 ... naahh thats absurd ...

Get your facts straight."
,brokenbentou,2010-11-24T04:44Z,"Ace1982, i recovered my password just to reply to you. If you have the luxury of going around trolling innocent pirates, then go buy yourself a freaking 2TB hard drive, and stop bitching. have a nice day :D"
,GStudio,2010-12-03T04:09Z,"Ace1982, you're probably the biggest bitch I've seen on TPB. "
,psut,2010-12-05T20:49Z,"Ok, Ace...  First of all - ""Ace""?  You've got to be kidding me.  Your name should be ""stupid pathetic little whiney dumbass bitch"".  Second, mkv isn't bullshit.  It's actually an awesome format, as it can hold multiple audio and subtitle tracks.  It's one of the greatest formats out there b/c of it's versatility in that manner.  Not to mention, if you're going to complain about something not being in English, make sure you SPELL English correctly.  On top of this, MKV IS encoded video, so I'm sure that the encoder has heard of video encoders.  As MKV also has more settings than other encoders to ENABLE soft subs & multiple audio tracks, I'd say that the noob here is you.  Monitoring your IP address?  Do you REALLY think that's what's going on here?  You're just a f'n moron.  I really do like Hero's comment likening you to a 6 year old who has had their cake taken away on their birthday.  He neglected to add ""spoiled brat"", though.
Another thing...  There are a HUGE portion of people in the world that DON'T speak English.  Including a lot that do speak Japanese.  Ever think that any of them might actually prefer the originals?  Not everyone is as short sighted as you in your pure ignorance & stupidity.  Go play in a shark tank."
,MRsouleater27,2011-01-12T04:31Z,"while I'll admit 21.23 gb are a lot.... who cares.  it's fma in high definition, not too mention one of the greatest anime shows of the past decade.  I feel sorry for you ace, because you really are a baby back bitch... Sorry, I just had to join in on this. lol"
,5150XXX,2011-01-25T21:11Z,I hate reading but couldnt find from 40 on in Eng.  so thanks. Good quality.
,shadowblade016,2011-02-12T20:52Z,"First off I wish to thank the uploader for this. 
Second: Ace you're a retard. I looked at the Eclipse site at these and They are 330-340MB per file which is normal for 1280x720. If you want smaller files in xvid follow the link in the information section on this page. It'll take you to the Eclipse site and those files are there. Alot of people appreciate this since not everyone knows where to find the subbers sites. Stop being a whiny ungrateful asshole. If you don't like the file don't download it. Though since you did shut up and be thankful its here since you wouldn't have it at all otherwise."
,Giandokan,2011-02-20T17:25Z,im a bit picky about my subs so can anyone tell me what subs are used for 'winry/winly' 'ishbal/ishbar' etc (not sure if these still apply to brotherhood)
,Leguimo,2011-03-19T21:56Z,Help.. Download speed currently at 30 Kb/s   ;-;
,Mike26534,2011-03-28T07:20Z,"Ace.. i get irritated just by reading your sentence and your essay. Let's get this straight, the reason it's take you your life to download it is because your internet is too damn slow. 

Even my utorrent estimated it will take me aprox. 13 hours to download this anime"
,pooplapoop3,2011-03-29T00:14Z,"Fisrt of all thanks alot anonymous.

Second, Ace U R A DICK WAD

And lastly Mike26534, OMG your internet is fast. Mines been goin at a steady rate of about 3kb/s. Which has probably got somthing to do with the fact that i still have dial-up. :L"
,KimplerMcmajor,2011-03-29T16:54Z,"you guy know ace is just a trolling, 12 year old "
,filthstep,2011-04-04T00:01Z,"1stly thank you for  HQ torrenting its not only in hd but all in one torrent unlike all the other people uploading single episode and 2ndly imust agree and get in on the humiliation of a 12 year old troll by saying that ace the same amount of brain cells as a drooling dung bettle, and ads just as much to the conversation as the same."
,filthstep,2011-04-04T00:02Z,"oh and thirdly

,theonenonlykyler,2011-04-11T03:13Z,i just wish funimation would hurry up and release part 4 in English or else i would get this.. lol.. ill just have to wait.
,confundo,2011-05-03T00:38Z,"I'm having a problem with finding a mp tht works for these files. There's either a problem with the audio or video delay or just messed up colors or an overall laggy experience.
And since I'm not good at these things I haven't been able to do some high tech solution for this so I've just tested loads of diffrent mp's. Such as VLC, MPC, KMPlayer, Windows MP, RealPlayer and BS player.
Advise please? it would be greatly appreciated."
,LeoJ777,2011-05-10T06:31Z,"Never written a comment before I just wanted to say this anime is amazing, although some of the subs could use some work, the video uality is steller. Great Job Anonymous you are pro Ace you are clearly a nube enojy not knowing what you are talking about I mean really that's about average for a high def anime, and its worth all the space so put a cork in it, cuz nobody wants to hear uneducated comments like the ones coming from you this torrent rocks, its the best one I've seen for the complete brotherhood after checking 5 dif sites so you need to chillax Ace NUBE!"
,WillyLad,2011-05-18T18:08Z,Ace.. this is the 21st fucken century mate get new internet and a fucken better hardrive if you think 21gb is overkill and a new monitor too if oyu cant handle 720 shitcunt

,Black_Beard,2011-09-08T14:02Z,Does this have English Audio?
,warcrazym,2011-09-17T19:56Z,"@Black_Beard: No this does not have english audio. Japanese audio with english subs.

On a side note i finally finished downloading this after 6 days and the audio is terribly out of sync with the video. Any suggestions to this unfortunate problem would be much appreciated. thanks in advance"
,Ale1213,2011-10-23T23:41Z,@warcrazym The audio is not out of sync.
,hsirrine,2012-03-05T19:40Z,"Hi. Uploader here. Thx for all the feedback.(even if it is largely troll flaming) I'm back to seeding this personally now but thanks for keeping it alive for so long. My KAT listing got Iced by the copyright pigs, so this is the only listing left that I personally posted. Feel free to list this .tor on your own sites and even take credit for it, as long as it keeps the swarm going. Peace.

A few notes. 1)NO OVA's, though they are available elsewhere. NO English Audio either.. this torrent is FANSUBS only(damn good ones too) and is NOT sourced from DVD. 2)I believe that the xVid .avi files are still available on the site linked in the description, and work great on my ps3, so don't re-encode, download. 3)I personally recommend SMplayer for the technically challenged. Though I'm not too familiar with the windows version it is a great gui frontend for Mplayer, which is probly the most versatile media package available. "
,glavan117,2012-05-25T10:39Z,this one looks good hope its not outta sync
,KubeKK,2012-06-03T23:32Z,"could someone seed pretty please? ^^
