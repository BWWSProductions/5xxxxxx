,legal_pirate,2010-08-21T05:10Z,"Doesn't run. Wants a cd key. And if I close the cd key window, game doesn't load. 
You've made the setup on your own, you don't even have a readme to tell us the process. 
Bad download."

,madchanson,2010-12-01T02:34Z,"okay, managed to install it successfully. Btw, i am running on Windows 7.

when i try to run it, it asks for the CD key. so what i do is just press Quit Game and it goes directly to the menu. but when i tried to create a game. it crashes.

@AntonioMontana; thanks for the tip but it didn't work. tried running it under WindowsXP compatibility but still crashes.

@uploader, can you help us on this one? thanks in advance"
