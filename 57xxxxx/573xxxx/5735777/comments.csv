Theme Description

The Final Fantasy XIII Windows 7 Theme consists of 10+ HD Final Fantasy XIII Wallpapers Custom Final Fantasy XIII Icons and select sounds from the game.

Final Fantasy XIII is the thirteenth installment in the Final Fantasy series, and is the first of the series to be released on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game runs on Crystal Tools (formerly known as White Engine), a proprietary engine built for Square Enix?s next-generation games.

This installment of the game introduced a few innovations to the series: a fast-paced combat mechanic, a new system determining which abilities are developed for the characters called ?Crystarium?, and a customizable ?Paradigm? system to control which abilities are used by the characters.

Final Fantasy XIII also includes elements from the previous games, such as summoned monsters, chocobos and airships."
