Biography:

Four friends suspend themselves in a state of elated bliss.
The band was started by guitarist <strong>Jack Armenian</strong>, who was writing
music which soon began to take shape and acquire it's own style.
<strong>Dryden Mitchell (Alien Ant Farm)</strong>, an eminent singer with one of the
most ornate voices in Rock since Freddie Mercury, delivers the voice
and stories. Drummer <strong>Roman Lomtadze</strong>, moving from Prague to Los Angeles,
creates the rhythmic backbone. <strong>Mike McKinnon</strong> equips the band with rowdy cadences on bass.

Armed with youthful rebellious attitudes and unconstricted blood vessels,
Send The Sages enter the rock world with eyes closed and an evocative approach
on making weighty audio combustions.
