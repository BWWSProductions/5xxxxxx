During the time of Dreamcast Sega released many great titles, Skies of Arcadia, Jet Set Radio, Ecco and while many of these titles were amazing in their own respects they didn?t garner the attention they should have. Wanting to bring some of their lesser known franchises to groups outside of their fanbase, Sega AM2 is porting F355 Challenge to PlayStation 2. Gameplay details on the game are very limited at the moment but, like the Dreamcast version, F355 on PlayStation 2 will allow gamers to play around on such world-famous courses as Monza, Suzuka, Motegi, Long Beach, and Fiorano.
