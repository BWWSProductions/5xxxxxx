,frodo5555,2010-11-10T19:03Z,"Thanks to Uploader, but it needs more Info about this image file...

Important Notice:
This is not a copy of the Original Game! This is RIPed CD version of the game, but RIGGED on DVD disc. Missing movies and most of the audio music. I have CD RIP version since original game was released and never had the opportunity to have Full Copy of the original.

I would like to use this opportunity to state that there is NO FULL COPY of the game (PAL, NTSC-U or NTSC-J) available on the internet and that all available torrents are dead or uncomplete.

So PLEASE if you have access to a copy or opportunity to make a backup of original, upload it via torrent and/or provide access to files via forums.

Your effort will be greatly appreciated!"
