,sensect,2010-08-04T10:06Z,Has anyone tested this?
,sensect,2010-08-04T12:42Z,"Tested this too. Works fine, big thanks for posting this.

It seems that this client is one version older than the official client so we cant play multiplayer atm.

Would love to see Multiplayer in action, anyway, thanks for sharing"
