,champdroid,2010-08-05T00:00Z,Crack doesn't make it pro 5.5.8 like a few of the pro 5.5.10 torrents uploaded here and I thank you for it.
,Mr_Miami,2010-08-06T03:44Z,"When it asks for the activation key just press ""i didnt purchase limewire pro"" it will remain pro."

,ericv1984,2010-08-17T09:06Z,"Don't listen to Mr. Miami. If you click ""i didnt purchase limewire pro"" it will not remain pro. It will give you the option to choose a 7 day free trial of pro instead."
,mjosa,2010-08-17T16:58Z,"I did exactly what Mr. Miami said, and it remains pro."

,enswash,2010-09-08T03:24Z,"You're probably doing the search for the .jar using windows 7. That will take you to the .jar in the crack file, not the one you need to replace. Don't be lazy and manually go to the lib directory."
,loyski,2010-09-08T06:18Z,"I got confused when it asked for activation key but there's no ""No Thanks"" button. So I just clicked ""I didn't purchase Limewire Pro"" and thanks God it still remained Pro version. :-)"

,Tovansky,2010-10-07T19:59Z,"used to be working, but I just downloaded this recently and something will go wrong if you download this around this time when limewire is already at 5.5.16. When it asked whether I purchased limewire pro or not, I said no and it would still be limewire pro, but after that there would be a forced update from limewire in which I can't stop and can't do anything about. We would have to wait for a new crack or a new version I guess. "
,Tovansky,2010-10-07T20:00Z,"I exited limewire from the taskbar and when I want to start it again, it would ask for me to update. when I said no, limewire wouldn't start. I think there is no other way than waiting for a newer version of the crack now. "
,ClaudiuTTTVenom,2010-11-12T15:15Z,"4. Start Limewire and on STEP 3 select ""NO THANKS""......retard theres no NO THANKS at spet 3 and LimeWire doesn't work , when i type smth to search it keeps saying LimeWire is connecting and stays like that so DON'T BOTHER TO DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT!..."
,hiteshc,2011-12-30T08:00Z,"not working for me ......
