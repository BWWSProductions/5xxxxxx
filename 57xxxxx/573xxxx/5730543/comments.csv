,wilywondr,2010-08-01T05:22Z,"@beast_rider
Why not download the same version that was uploaded yesterday that has approx 3000 seeders?"
,PhilLesh12,2010-08-01T05:37Z,"@Beast_Rider, when it is just getting started, EVERYONE but the original contributor is a ""leecher"".  

It takes a while for everyone to get a full copy so that they can become, in your mind, not leeching."
,jamde5201,2010-08-01T05:39Z,"Still just a CAM with somewhat decent audio.

Can't blame the lack of seeders."
,roland299,2010-08-01T08:15Z,"raymondathome I am grateful that you exist here on this site. I like the no nonsense uploads and can trust them. I ask you to look for A copy of restrepo, so far all have been trouble. Thanks roland299"
,PhilLesh12,2010-08-01T08:17Z,"@jamde5201,

It is taking me a long time to get a full copy, but I'm going to seed for a day once I get it.  Seeding isn't a function of the quality, it's a function of gratitude and a desire to give back.

Of course, I'm also seeding the parts that I have, since that's how torrent clients work.  A true leecher would be someone who throttles their upload bandwidth intentionally."
,roland299,2010-08-01T08:18Z,raymond coulld you please find a copy of restrepo
,PhilLesh12,2010-08-01T09:46Z,"Damn, now I want to find this movie, too.

,PhilLesh12,2010-08-02T05:55Z,"@roland299 

Someone on another site said he heard rumors of a Jan 2011 DVD release for Restrepo.

,trollking,2010-08-02T13:18Z,"Okay, I'm confused I just watched the movie and at the end... well it cuts, but I'm not sure if that's where the movie cuts or thats where you cut it... so what's up with that?"
,kryptois,2010-08-03T07:26Z,fuck this torrent dosent work on my xbox i hate when i download shit!!!!!!!
,shiningwiz,2010-08-03T14:01Z,"@ trollking - that's exactly where the movie ends.

This one is a good copy, very watchable, decent video (though a bit blurry) and very good audio. Very watchable, but it's better if you've already seen this once at least in cinemas."
,dj_biggins,2010-08-03T17:34Z,"@ Beast_Rider 

with a name like yours i think i know what i would rather be sticking my cock into, and the most funniest thing about your comments is you wrote it twice, so you obviously like writing the word fag, thus conclusion is.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... it takes one to know one Beast_Rider or what ever the fuck your real name is"
,unciano,2010-08-04T11:37Z,"l0ld@this:

Video Source::::::::: Russian DVD From a old friend. Thanks Mate :)"
,murrambingi,2010-08-04T12:21Z,"just downloaded it and it looks ok so far, i will get back to ya'z when i see the whole lot with details"
,First_rate_,2010-08-04T21:50Z,"Ok, for some time now people have been un-able to give legitimate ratings for audio and video. Whether they are visiually impaired or partially deaf i don't know, but they are usually misleading.
So from now on, i'm going to be commenting on every one that i can to give a REAL rating.

For this torrent the quality of Video and Audio is terrible.
A = 4
V = 4
You'd need a pair of glasses after watching."
,dac1949,2010-08-05T03:45Z,"thx, great job!"
,murrambingi,2010-08-07T12:51Z,"I will surely by this movie for myself, and i will even watch it in the cinema, thx for the upload, the sample was very clear to see but the movie itself was a bit fuzzy and blurry, watchable but it's purely for sample use only :)"
[T],jonnoel1,2010-08-10T02:39Z,"You cant possibly give a TS or a cam version of anything a 7 rating. Personally a 6-8 rating to me  is DVD quality, and 9 &10's are HQ and BR quality. TS and cams will come in at 1-5, this ones about a 3 to 4, still blurry, but so far the best one I've seen. If you havent seen this in the theatre yet, you might want to wait on this one, and go see it. This movie is fking awesome, especially in IMAX."
,petepat,2010-08-16T04:57Z,Very watchable and audio is good for a cam
,word304,2010-08-18T19:33Z,"A=4.5, V=4.5

On the rate scale where:
1-2 = Vid looks captured w/ a cell phone - mono sound
3-4 = VHS analog camera video - 'fuzzy' stereo sound
5-6 = High quality digital camera video - 2-channel stereo audio
7-8 = DVD rip video - clear stereo audio
9-10 = High-Def (720/1080) video - multi-channel surround sound audio

IMO currently the most reliable and consistent Inception torrent available.  Others may have better over-all quality but have periodic shaky & changing video/sound.

The movie is good enough to go see in the theater."
,xCogy420x,2010-09-05T17:25Z,"Alright pictures fuzzy, adio fades. but if you are broke and cant watch it in theaters, its perfect..."
,Beast_Rider,2010-09-21T00:38Z,"@dj your just one of the many morons that has nothing to say about the uploads and just bitches about other peoples comments, which says to me your a loser total loser has no friends and the only way you can get contact with someone and not your blow up dolls is to try and talk trash to someone online. WOW real big of you.... fag"
,00101010,2010-10-04T03:56Z,"DAMN, that's some poor quality audio and video!  But thanks for the up I suppose.

Video is on par with a 700MB video CD, if even that.  Audio is even worse and has a few glitches."
