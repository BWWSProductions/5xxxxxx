to tell the truth was a little skeptic about your comment and the site. but took a try and love it. works like a charm!!! thanks for sharing "
,mapple029,2011-01-16T02:11Z,anymore comments? has virus? or is it good to download? thx
,mrfiz,2011-02-04T15:17Z,jdtgfh and katequen are spammers the link provided by jdtgfh is crap and provides nothing of any benefit. Of course more people would know that because any time someone has to add letters to a link in a comment is because its to avoid spam detections. Quit spamming douchebags!
,mrfiz,2011-02-04T15:43Z,Also this is a virus it just popups up a error alert that says success and installs infected files into my wine folder *loves linux* Anyways dont download!
