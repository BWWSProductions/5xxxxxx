user ratings out of 10 are usually given relative to file sizes, and reflect only that user's opinion.

Good movie if your a Tekken fan and looking for a martial arts film to pass the time. You will recognize a lot of the moves the fighters use. Eddy vs Raven was bad ass. Unfortunately all the characters are portrayed as American faggots trying to be bad ass Japanese fighters, they completely ruined every Tekken character that appears in this film, seriously... Every one... Could any one take that pathetic excuse for Jin seriously? This film is bad but try to make it past the first 20 minutes of boredom. The fights entertain for a while until your hit with that annoying thing called the plot.

Don't play Tekken? Don't download this steaming pile of horse shit."

Great quality, visuals were great, but the most painfully crap talking (a.k.a. plot) I've had to sit through in years. HUGE Tekken fan, hated this more than Dragon Ball. However, hella-fine Christie walking around with half her ass hanging out was not as painful as the rest of the film, but it wasn't nearly adequate enough to sedate the rest of the ""film."""
,Sfinx_P,2010-08-28T18:22Z,Great Upload Thanks!!!! (Not much of a movie though)
,umarnawazkhan,2010-09-02T09:08Z,"change your upload video's to MP4 or MKV
for high quality
720p - x264

What is x264?

x264 is an open-source encoder for the H.264 codec used for High-Definition movies on HD-DVDs and Blu-Ray Discs. It has a high compression which is way superior to xvid. That means you get more quality at equal bitrates. A 700MB x264 rip will be sharper and more detailed than a 700MB xvid rip from the same source. x264 is the future in DVDrips!

What is a .mkv file?

MKV means matroska video and it is a extensible open standard Audio/Video container (AVI is a container, too!). This file format combines several video streams, audiostreams, subtitles, chapters and information in only one file. It supports new standards like 6-channel AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) audio or x264 video "
