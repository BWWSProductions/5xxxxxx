GROUPNOTES

FWYH : FUCK WHAT YOU HEARD, We're all about Family
Dedication, Quality, Respect & LOVE for the music
As the years passes,all our motives and objectives
remain,we want to give the best on dark electronic
genres,with the quality deserved for the only true
underground scene,the future might be these genres

To all the artists that we release, some newcomers
& other established acts: We are sorry if you dont
understand the promotion we do, of your own work,
but if your music is full of quality,we are pretty
sure that a lot of people will spend their money
on your art. Our intention isn't to spread for the
masses, but just to promote good music, so all we
can ask is an apologize for any misunderstanding
You People deserve all our respect and attention

As opposite to all the Xdcc & p2p lamerz that one
day will problaly destroy us all, our releases are
not supposed to be spread all round,but to be were
they are meant to stay Behind doors & locked away

GREETS

To our competition: AMOK, CMG, D2H, radial, SEVER
for all the good "fights", may you lose more than
win,there's no room for second place on this bizz

To all the crews that have been an example for us
trough this years, many to enumerate, but we all
know "Who is Who", Props go to "WHO" deserves it

And finally, greets to all FWYH guys and their own
families, takes time and patience to go along with
all of this, so the warmest greets are to them
