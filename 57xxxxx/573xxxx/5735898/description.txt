Submitted for your approval: 74.7GB of manuals to civilian and military firearms. This includes manuals, gunsmithing, blueprints, etc.

These are sorted into one level of directories, such as "AK-47" or "Browning" but no farther. You will often have to sort Browning Buckmark manuals from Browning BAR blueprints.

Finally, remember Robert Heinlein's warning about the demon drink: "Beware strong drink, it may make you shoot at tax collectors and miss."
