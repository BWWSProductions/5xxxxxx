     yet another ancient band comes out of the ashes.. anyway          
     video seems to be part of sum movie.                              
                                                                       
     audio edit was not possible, due to the shear amount of sfx       
     in the audio (most likely they just overlayed the movie over      
     the top of the cd-audio). Also take note this isnt the            
     directers cut version, as its missing a good portion from the     
     start. enjoy :)

     Stoned Ripping Project was founded in 2003 with the sole aim      
     of providing the scene with the  best Rock & Metal vids from      
     all around the world.  We do this for the love of the music,      
     and of course,  for fun. Despite the ease with which you can      
     find  streaming videos online today,  we feel that releasing      
     high quality rips, free of restrictions, is as important now      
     as it has ever been.
