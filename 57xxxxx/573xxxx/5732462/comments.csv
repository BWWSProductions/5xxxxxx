audio:
AAC at ~320kbps

,moreuse,2010-08-03T08:13Z,"i though the one that use Xbox 360 rip are ""celestial being"" group on nyaatorrens?

on this torrent, the seeder say "" source is from FFXIIIultima and are mixed with video rips from the game for better quality""

hopefully what better quality mean = ripped from MPEG2 streams on PS3 BR Disc."

Even the xbox360 rips are better than the quality of the ffxiiiultima videos."
,yooby,2010-08-03T16:43Z,but ya... would have loved to see some ps3 BD rips in there.
,moreuse,2010-08-05T14:10Z,"^^ if sony not remove Other OS from PS3. It will be kind of easy to rip the FF XIII Bluray videos there.

usually ps3 use normal mpeg2 videos. or slighly modified one."
