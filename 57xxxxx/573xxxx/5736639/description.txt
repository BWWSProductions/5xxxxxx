This is Valentin Chu's shocking book Ta Ta, Tan Tan - The Inside Story of Communist China (1963) which presents a detailed and authoritative account of Red China then, based on a careful and informed examination of what the Chinese Communists say themselves in their newspapers, magazines, and propaganda releases. "Ta ta, tan tan" or "Fight fight, talk talk" - a phrase used by the Communists themselves to describe the way they have subjugated the vast Chinese mainland and now threaten the rest of the world. In almost every sphere, Chu points out, contradictions appear. Grandiose promises have not been fulfilled. Agricultural, industrial, and scientific "advances" have resulted in chaos rather than progress. Educational reforms have been half-hearted and ineffectual. Hacking away the age-old roots of Chinese culture, the Communists have succeeded only in causing widespread discontent. These and other facts are in marked contrast to the "figures" and the carefully guided tours upon which many experts have based their reports on China. Ta Ta, Tan Tan looks behind the propaganda smokescreen to describe the country as it really is. 315 pages. A must read for everyone.
