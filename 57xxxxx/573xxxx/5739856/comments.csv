yet the US was not involved in WW2 until 1941, yet apparently soldiers are off to the front?
The acting and direction is sooo wooden, is this a joke to do with the wooden puppets? Then
we have a poster saying join the US marines with a picture of a RAF Lancaster bomber? So it
goes on....You have the ""German"" spies saluting each other with ""Hiel Hitler"" which would 
never happen ( German spies were from the Abwher and all who entered the US were anti-Nazi
escapists and either caught or turned as in Britain ) then he dresses up in a bullshit 
Luftwaffe uniform, even the swastiker on his arm is the wrong way round on the wrong arm. 
Only an American would behave like that. The constant uneducated script 
becomes almost painful with its lack of historical accuracy and humour, unless that is the humour as
a tongue in cheek joke that might as well be my cock. They're either taking the piss, pissed
or morons who made this to waste our time.KRAPPP!"
