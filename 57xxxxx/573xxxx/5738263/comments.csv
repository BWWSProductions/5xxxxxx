I would like to know if you guys could get the next food nextwork star season 6on your list of shows.  Someone started them, continued them to episode six and then stopped.  If there is anyone that I know that could do this it would be you.  If you can that is great, if not then thanks anyway."

ALL of their Immerse releases (720p) of TV Shows uploaded after 1st August 2010 DO NOT WORK if streamed on PS3 via PS3 Media Server. 
Something must've changed in .mkv encoding and I'd like to bring it to their attention."
