,GUYMOVIE,2010-08-01T04:03Z,hi ctang thanks for being positive against me......and waiting for the upcoming movies.....and nice release too thanks...
[T],ctang,2010-08-01T04:45Z,"@agentbay:  ya it sucks that i cant edit my torrents because that how i used to do it...i would just make some random description and then do it like it should be...a great example of this is my upload of ""under the tuscan sun"" but at least i have the title right...lol...i saw that link you posted and knew exactly what happened

@guymovie:  no problem...your welomce"
,GUYMOVIE,2010-08-01T05:26Z,hi man one question.Are u in any of the social networking sites?
,omegafox84,2010-08-01T06:10Z,@ctang: this is definitely my favorite Will Farrell movie. the best part is the standoff in the alley. i already have this but it's the full screen version. i'll have to download this as a replacement. thanks man!
[T],ctang,2010-08-02T01:48Z,"@guymovie:  im not sure i know what you mean by social networks

@omegafox:  i have to say that im not a big will ferell fan but i do like a few of his movies like this one, step brothers and his limited role in wedding crashers...other than that i cant even think of any movies i really liked him in...talladega nights had its moments but was more stupid to me than funny...just my opinion though

@agentbay:  what i want to know is how out of millions of comments a day they find just the spam comments...i actually dont think that they do that bad of a job weeding out the spam comments, although i didnt see what site you put on here...was it a legit site or could it have been considered spam?"
[T],ctang,2010-08-02T01:49Z,"@agentbay: nevermind, i know what you mean now...i just clicked on the sssssssss link and the torrent got deleted...or at least im assuming thats what you were talking about in your last comment"
,raththesh,2010-08-02T04:48Z,does anyone know any good burning program either then nero or clonedvd that i can use
[T],ctang,2010-08-02T06:12Z,"well for mac you can use toast 10 (compression and burning) and for windows you can use imgburn for iso or other formats of images and for compression and burning you can use dvd-rebuilder

hope that helps"
,raththesh,2010-08-02T09:02Z,"do you happen to have any of the following movies on dvd: the losers, kick-ass, death at a funeral(martin lawrence) and it would be greatly appreciated if you also upload these without anything removed
thx by the the way for the suggestions earlier"

,GUYMOVIE,2010-08-03T07:01Z,hi ctang hw can seedkey can upload a movie before he get it in the retail market....i'm checking it using videoeta.com and  it is right all the time.
[T],ctang,2010-08-03T07:32Z,could work at a video store because they are usually at the store about a week b4 they hit the shelves...i actually got 300 about a month b4 it hit the shelves because of this :)
