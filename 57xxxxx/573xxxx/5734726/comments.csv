Batman ? The Dark Knight has gotten some awesome reviews even from the harshest of critics and the reason is simple ? its an awesome movie. From the scale, to the acting, the atmosphere, the music, the action, it?s all art. An imperishable, spectacular and chaotically-brilliant movie.

The Dark Knight possesses the essence that should always exist in the handover from comics to the big screen. Sequence after sequence, this is the absolute glory. This is the first time as far as I remember ? where a summer blockbuster film far surpassed the hype.

So here we present the Batman ? The Dark Knight Movie Theme, for all the fans. This theme consists of the 25+ Hi-Res Wallpapers, Custom Batman Icons and select sounds from the movie. I am sure, when you start your computer ? it?ll put a ?Smile? on your face."
