I cracked some of the game code and added a speed controlling on the game, so you dont have to use programs to slow down your CPU, it removes the super-speed of the game, and adds some nice fps control, you can play just like old times

This mod also has 2 special keys i coded, they are:
Page UP: Speeds up the game while held
Page DOWN: Slow down the game while held

NOTE: You dont have to overwrite ANY original files, just put all files in RISING LANDS folder and run the game using RISING4.EXE

This version also comes cracked, and is compatible with rip versions of the game (no movies etc)

Update info:
-Fixed memory bug when you drop something on the ground and the game crashes
-A new known bug happens when you win mission 2 and start mission 3, fixing this bug now, hope i have a fix in next version, if you wish to use version 2.1b wich i think does not have this bug, go for: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5735233/Rising_Lands_Frame_rate_%28FPS%29_Fix
