I scanned this myself.  It's in DjVu format for space reasons.


Weighing in at about 500 pages, this is arguably one of the best textbooks for learning to read Japanese.  The book will take about 6 months to a year for an average learner to work through fully and should have the student ready to read newspaper articles and non-fiction with the help of a dictionary.

This is the grammar and example text volume.  I may post volume 2 with the exercises later.
