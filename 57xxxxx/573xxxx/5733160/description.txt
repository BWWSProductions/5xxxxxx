This worked for me i am not sure if it will work for all phones as the rumor flying around the internet states OFFICIAL BUT NOT FINAL. 

a few new features
* flash light with 3 levels
* pin password protection
* car dock settings
* camera settings rotate with phone
* landscape mode not limited to left tilt
* ability to use the light with the camcorder
* FM radio widget
* News and weather widget
* App sharing
* ability to store and run apps on SD card

I am sure there is more this is just a quick list of what i found, any comments of what i missed would be appreciated. Also let me know what you think.

Things i have noticed are the wifi connection is a lot better and the phone runs a lot faster. My opinion!
