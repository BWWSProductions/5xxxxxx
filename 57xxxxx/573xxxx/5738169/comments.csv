But for a native Danish speaker itÂ´s very disturbing with hardcoded subtitles where half of them are simply not translated correctly... it becomes a very surrealistic show for non Danish speakers, I bet! Lolland for instance, translates to Los Angeles :))
Furthermore, why hardcoding subs into it? Better to just leave the subs as they are in the torrent and let people do with them what they want. Hardcoding is an irreversible process and only reason for doing it is when somebodyÂ´s got a hardware mediastreamer thatÂ´s not able to cope with subtitle files. 
But thatÂ´s a pretty small part of the community here I guess, and they should rather just do this themselfes, rather than having the file permantly damaged.
Anywayz, IÂ´m sure your intentions were good, and my respect for finding this little pearl :)"
,hrpik,2010-08-20T06:40Z,"FartDater - Yeah, I didn't want to hardsub it, but it can be a pain to use subs, some media players have shit support for subs... :/

I was going to go over the subs again before i hardsubbed it, but I didn't have any time ;_;"
,FartDater,2010-08-24T20:40Z,"Hi there, and thanks for answering.

Ok, what about releasing it again and including the srt files you´ve found in the torrent, so that people can decide whether if they need it to be hardsubbed? Or perhaps you have the RS link to where you first found it?"

Would be really nice to have a clean copy of this film :)"
,FartDater,2010-08-24T21:52Z,Sorry for the multiple identical replies.. didnt realize that thepiratebay delays the posting of comments so clicked submit a couple of times..
,hrpik,2010-08-25T22:45Z,Hehe... I'll reupload it here tonight :)
,FartDater,2010-08-28T21:17Z,Awesome! Thanks!
,hrpik,2010-09-02T04:13Z,"Ooops, kinda forgot about this.
I tried to recreate the torrent, but uTorrent just doesn't want to work for me.
The original rs link is here:

I heard about that before, but I also heard a rumor that it was never really released after the initial premier (or something like that). It's supposed to be someone like ""lord of the flies""."
,FartDater,2010-09-10T21:00Z,Thanks for the link hrpik!!!
