Hej.
So, it took me a while to find this video, had to go
through over 9000 downloads on RS, which was the biggest
pain in the ass. I fucking raged so hard, just to download
one movie.
I decided to hard sub it, using vdub, and release it on to
Demonoid & TPB...
I'm not sure how accurate the subs are, I haven't even watched
the movie yet tbh (been really busy). If they're not that good,
I'll resub it with different ones... and please comment on the
torrent (whether on TPB or Demonoid), I do read em~!

If you like this movie, you should probably check out other
movies by Lasse Nielsen.

Tak.
Ps: Frederik J., HAI

Note: The imdb says the film was released in mono, but
this is in stereo... weird.
