Like many others we love this show and have created a new Windows 7 theme for all the True Blood fans. The Theme consists of 25+ HD Wallpapers, Custom Icons and select sounds from the True Blood TV Series.

True Blood is an American television drama series created and produced by Alan Ball. It is based on The Southern Vampire Mysteries series of novels by Charlaine Harris, and details the co-existence of vampires and humans in Bon Temps, a fictional small Louisiana town. The series centers on Sookie Stackhouse, a telepathic waitress at a bar, who falls in love with a vampire Bill Compton.

In this series the Vampires not only exist, but the entire world knows about them. Since a Japanese scientist?s invention of synthetic blood, vampires have progressed from legendary monsters to fellow citizens overnight. The show has completed 3 seasons so far with a 4th season planned for release in Summer 2011."
