[T],Toya_Torrent,2010-08-01T13:08Z,"Great that this wonderful movie came up with a god qvalite as a XviD. Thank you!
But... Zen_Bud... I would really appreciate that you wrote CUSTOM SWESUBS in your releases and also who is behind the swedish text. Not only because it was me, robin8 and Simontax who spent hardworking two weeks to create the swedish text for this one but also because it is very important to know who is behind the swedish subtitle before you choose to download a movie. I am certinaly intrested to get this information as I have seen big differens i quality for swedisj subtitles depending on who made it."
[V],Zen_Bud,2010-08-01T13:28Z,I will say THX too the film producer ;)
[T],Toya_Torrent,2010-08-01T13:59Z,"Hahahaha :D
I agree and say thanks to all who made this movie. I didn't ask you to thank me or any other swedish translators. I just want the information before I download a torrent ;)"
