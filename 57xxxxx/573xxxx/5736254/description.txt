[color=pink]Release Notes:[/color]
Right...here we go with our 2nd version of inception :lol:. Anyway we got better audio last night...this sounds alot
more crisp, and not as hollow, we filtered it so it sounds pretty good audio. The 1st 7 minutes of the audio were 
very very fuzzy, so we added the line audio from our previous release, which was also good and the rest is new audio..
we re did the video lowering the orange a bit more, and trying to bring a little more colour into the other scenes instead
of it looking dull. Added a sharpness and video denoise filters and a lot more. Overall this is a good movie from what ive
saw of it so far. Enjoy better release with better audio :)
