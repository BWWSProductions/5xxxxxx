,syk0inc,2010-09-17T10:02Z,"unrar game unpak v 102 in ur Need For Speed SHIFT directory.

run the gameunpak.bat file

will make a back up dir Backup_Pakfiles about 3.90gb

i unrared the DLC pack and then manually added
all the files folder by folder .

all cars work sounds decals etc

o yea dont use the  JSGME.exe .. there is a trojan in it 

skip steps :

appear in the folder MODS.
4. Content Archive DLC_all_fix.7z copy in a folder MODS. It should look like C:  games  Need for Speed - Shift  MODS  DLC_all_fix.
5. Open the folder with the game JSGME.exe. Select the modes in the left window and add it to the game an arrow "">"". The game is ready to launch.

dont know what the -loose parameter does.

but the game does not launch if u dont add it."
