The European power metal combo Primal Fear
has been kicking around the metal underground
for years, refining their brand of melodic
riffing and soaring vocals. Their sound,
highly influenced by Gamma Ray (who has
traded members with this band) and Judas
Priest, was introduced on their 1998
eponymous debut. The following year
showed them gathering a press following
when Jaws of Death  gained them positive
reviews from most respectable metal critics.
On top of that, their European popularity
flourished as power metal enjoyed moderate
success in the overseas mainstream. Nuclear Fire
followed in 2001, leading to their first
U.S. appearances in the guise of several
large metal festivals throughout the year.
They returned to the studio in early
2002, recording and releasing Black Sun
by the end of spring.
