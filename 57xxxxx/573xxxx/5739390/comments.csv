or I have to installe it in my GPS that I already have. thank you."
,hub_cap,2010-08-04T19:59Z,Downloaded both and seeding. What are the install instructions please?
,ChaoticEvil,2010-08-04T22:15Z,"Extract the files using 7Zip to a directory. To install, run the MSI file. This will install the maps to the computer, then you need to do the following:

1. Delete Mapsource files from C:\Garmin (assumed) and install Mapsource 6.15.7
2. Replace the Mapsource EXE with a hacked EXE
3. Delete Mapinstall files from C:\Garmin (again assumed) and Install Mapinstall 3.13.2.

The reason these specific versions of Mapsource and Mapinstall are required is because otherwise the unlock code generated by the Jetmouse keygen will not work. Later versions of Mapsource and Mapinstall defeat the keygen. Obviously, you will also need the Jetmouse Keygen or another method of unlocking the maps. Map ID 2265.

Run the MapInstall program from the created directory and select ""Unlock Maps"" to call up a new screen with two tabs, ""Unlock Maps"" and ""Unlock Regions"". Select the ""Unlock Regions"" tab. Click on ""Add"" to call up a dialogue with two spaces, ""Unlock Code"" and ""Comments"". Copy the Map Unlock code from the key generator if it is still open, or open the ""gmapsupp.unl"" file in notepad and copy from there. Paste the code into the ""Unlock Code"" section of the dialogue and click ""OK"". This will unlock the maps. Select the maps to be installed and click ""Next"". Let the program build the selected maps and copy them to the storage card.

This is the process I used for 2011.10 and it worked fine. It's working as we speak, as I transfer 2011.20 to my units."
,ChaoticEvil,2010-08-04T22:18Z,"Just to add, Mapinstall, Mapsource, the hacked EXE, and the Jetmouse keygen should all be readily available if you don't already have them.

Ignore references to copying the key to a file named ""gmapsupp.unl"". Such a file is not required if installing to dedicated GPS units."

,monkmarr,2010-08-24T04:52Z,"Why would you want to but yes you can, just save a copy of the older versions for next time!"
,hollapm,2010-09-07T05:25Z,"I'm about to throw in the towel.  I've had success downloading the maps to the GPS, and can view that they successully installed, but when I try to route it gives me this error ""route calculation error"".  I can view maps, see where I am but I am unable to route myself anywhere.  When I first transferred the data to the device this was the original message I received, ""detail maps dont support routing""

any ideas?"
,SunyJim,2010-10-03T04:31Z,"I'm sure you figured out your routing issue by now, but for anyone else. In mapsource, at the bottom of the maps tab column is a check box. 
Make sure it's checked.
""Include route calculation data."""
,MISTERFUNKTASTIC,2010-10-08T02:35Z,"All of the above is not neccessary. Just install the program. Use the Garmin 1.5 keygen to generate a map unlock code using your device ID and map ID (2265).

Google to find Garmin 1.5 keygen.

This is how I installed 2010 & 2009, and it worked for 2011."
,battlebrand,2010-10-13T18:48Z,"I installed the new maps, entered the code and now says its unauthenticated? The map detail is locked, any ideas?"
,h200,2010-10-22T09:05Z,Does this install the full 3D maps for NA as well?
,doombugg,2010-11-23T07:42Z,cool it works thanks
