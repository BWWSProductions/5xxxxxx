This is from the 7th season of the BBC show Fourty Minutes. It is episode 23.

The Case of Sherlock Holmes was a feature in the BBC's well-respected 40 Minutes strand (despite lasting nearly twice that length) described by its makers as "a documentary entertainment". It's a detailed look at the whole, sometimes bizarre, world that's grown up around the character: everything from Old Foggy London Town package tours for wealthy Americans to serious literary scholars, from historical and social analysts to the dedicated group who make a yearly pilgrimage to the tiny US town of Moriarty to heap abuse on the head of Holmes's greatest enemy and sing "Happy Unbirthday, You Bastard" in his memory. The many film and TV extracts include some real rarities, including a brief clip of Leonard Nimoy in the role. The programme is presented by Tim Pigott-Smith, who has played both Holmes and Watson. Oh - keep watching afterthe closing credits for a couple of tiny but nice codas. Written by Brian Thompson & David Pearson and produced by David Pearson. Aired on BBC2 on 10th December 1987.

This is not an original rip. I located this on another site and saw that noone else had it. Thanks to JHWatson for the original upload.
