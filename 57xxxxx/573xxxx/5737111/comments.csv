this set of Merle Haggard in Vol 1 & 2 are all buggered up. they skip like crazy.
something must have happened in the original rip.
I love Merle and all the music you share. I will try them again later."
,paullob,2010-08-06T23:00Z,sorry. it's not this set - it is the capital set vol 1 and 2.
,paullob,2010-08-06T23:01Z,"and i got them all working as well.

thanks"
