,VR,2010-07-31T22:38Z,"As always thanks, as a fan of yours ""I"" always know what to expect and that's great post ""always""."
,tdmk1,2010-07-31T22:55Z,"Just for clarity, I always upload the entire broadcast - literally from the first to the last frame...

The discription is copied from tvguide.co.uk & then I use media info for the rest - I was sort of hoping that people would realise that the file duration being (in this case)  2h 18mn meant the whole show was being shared. :)
