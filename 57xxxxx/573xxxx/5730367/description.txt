The Sofa of Time was a BBC Radio 4 comedy drama. It was first broadcast in 2002. 

Milford and Parker get sacked from their jobs in a soft furnishings factory in Crouch End. 
As they are clearing out their lockers, they fall into the magical world of Gravy. 
Frost described Gravy as an "Tolkien-esque world with supermarkets and banks". 

There they meet Marmite the Dwarf, who believes that Milford is "the chosen one". 
He has come at last to save the people from the evil emperor warlock Raamen Bod, who plans to find the Sofa of Time, the most magical and powerful item of furniture in the entire universe, and use it for evil purposes. 

The series featured TV's Spaced regulars as well as Kevin Eldon, Daisy Jones and Joseph Marcell.
