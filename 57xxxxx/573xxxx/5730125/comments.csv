,scrdppy,2010-08-01T06:43Z,"note that this iso and the reloaded iso are the same with respect the starcraft contents; so if you have the reloaded iso, you can install from there, and then you can use or get the razor1911 crack-only, you don't have to get the whole iso just for the crack. Tested this with md5 sum.

so in conclusion, what razor1911 iso has more is these:

,zhool,2010-08-02T11:01Z,"As stated, this is the reloaded iso with the razor1911 crack, which enables both the campaign and skirmish maps (other cracks may not enable skirmish)

get the same crack/map enabler only here - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5730029/Starcraft_II_Wings_Of_Liberty_Proper-Razor1911-CrackOnly

follow the instructions in the ifo... BUT

if the KEYTRO program crashes - get the free trial version of sandboxie at sandboxie.com and use that to run it (by dragging keytro onto the sandboxie window and selecting 'run outside sandbox')

(don't 4get to hit f2 to apply the crack, once you're done rolling your eyes)

as you will see when it starts running, the crash is probably due to the 3D application it runs, which is much like milkdrop or the AVS which comes with winamp, and i know both of those have crashed for me on occasion. having said that, there is probably some system fix, such as dep or something, that you could do so as not to need sandboxie, but it seems like it could be useful for similar but perhaps more sinister programs.

in closing, if r1911 is browsing, i like the retro riff for the map copier, but i think the keytro thing is a bit much, crashing aside.

you need the following:

2. razor1911 crack
3. reloaded crack

do the following steps:
1. install a fresh copy of starcraft 2 (uninstall previous starcraft 2)
2. DO NOT UPDATE (close the updater immediately if it appeared)
3. copy all the contents of RELOADED crack (EXCEPT the Battle.Net folder)
on the installed directory of starcraft 2

1. disconnect from the internet if you are connected.

2. install SC2 by mounting the ISO and skip the activation when asked (installing can take 10 minutes).

3.after installing dont click PLAY, quit out of the installer.

4. open the RELOADED folder called ""Crack""  and copy all files into your game folder on the PC, normally at C:\Program Files\StarCraft II (if it asks do you want to replace any files click yes.)

5 click the file ""Update.bat"" you just copied into the game folder and let it update the game.

6. now open the folder called ""Razor1911"" on the ISO and click SC2_COPY.exe to install extra content.

7. again open the RELOADED CRACK folder and copy all files into your game folder on the PC, normally at C:\Program Files\StarCraft II (yes do it again this is not an error!)

6. now you can play the game by clicking the desktop icon (ALWAYS play offline and never get any patches or updates as this will stop the game from working, you can learn how to play from the ingame tutorial.)"

,wiltuz,2011-01-18T09:16Z,"Quick update!
if any of u guys have Nvidea Geforce 310M and the game stutters and lags like shit, it probably is because of the latest driver(260.99 i guess) Just rollback ur driver and it will work perfect.
