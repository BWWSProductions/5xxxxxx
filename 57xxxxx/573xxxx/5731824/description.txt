team who created Fawlty Towers.

Romance with a Double Bass is a 1974 short film from the United
Kingdom. It was written by John Cleese, Connie Booth, and Bill Owen,
and based on the short story of the same name by Anton Chekhov.

Smychkov (Cleese), a bassist, shows up too early for the ball of a 
beautiful princess, and decides to spend his extra time skinny dipping in 
the nearby lake. The princess (Booth), meanwhile, has gone fishing at 
the lake, and later decides to go skinny dipping as well. However, things 
change when a thief absconds with both Smychkov's and the Princess' 
clothes, and while the Princess is wandering around, she meets 
Smychkov. After their initially embarrassing encounter, he tries to help 
her return to the castle by hiding her in his bass case.
