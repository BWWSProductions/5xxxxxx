Together for just four years, and having already worked with
producer Gavin Monaghan (Kings of Leon, Editors, Ryan Adams)
on previous projects, Voodoo Johnson are now putting the
final touches on their brand new album 10,000 Horses with
producer Romesh Dodangoda (Bullet For My Valentine, Kids In
Glass Houses, Funeral For A Friend) for release later this
year.

The group have received continued support from the likes of
Bruce Dickinson (BBC Radio 6 Rock Show) on national radio as
well as Myspaces Alex Zane (Mars Planets Radio). With a
number of national club tours under their belts, as well as
successful international festival dates to their name, Voodoo
Johnson look set for a big year in 2010.

If the idea of Queens Of The Stone Age nesting with Led
Zeppelin and Aerosmith appeals, then meet Voodoo Johnson, a
young Birmingham band whove the potential to be global
gods. ""
