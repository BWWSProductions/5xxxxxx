    In a Stateside hotel during the height of World War II, young Danny      
    Coogan dreams of joining the war effort. Following the murder of         
    hotel guest Mr. Toulon by Nazi assassins, Danny finds the old man's      
    crate of mysterious puppets and is suddenly thrust into a battle all     
    his own. He discovers that Nazis Max and Klaus, along with beautiful     
    Japanese saboteur Ozu, plan to attack a secret American manufacturing    
    plant. After his family is attacked and his girlfriend Beth is           
    kidnapped, it is up to Danny and the living deadly Puppets to stop       
    this Axis of Evil.
