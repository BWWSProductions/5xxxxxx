,DMZ_Sniper,2010-08-16T18:20Z,"Sound and video are unsynchronised. video quality is good, but it's really unsynced. Download something better."
[V],room101bellboy,2010-08-18T14:07Z,"Audio and video are in sync, all you need is a decent player and codecs. 

Try the KM player + coreAVC or Media Player Classic + coreAVC. "
