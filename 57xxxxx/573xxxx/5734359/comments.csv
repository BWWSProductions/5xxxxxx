,Balinor13,2010-08-14T01:33Z,"Amazing quality as always Meechorno.

Ive got your entire SG-1 and most of your Next Generation and they are all amazing quality for DVD rips. 

Thanks again."
,JT5150,2010-08-16T19:25Z,Awesome.  Thanks so much!  I have your whole Star Trek TNG saved on my computer!
,JT5150,2010-08-16T23:56Z,Excellent!  I was waiting for your upload of this!  I have the whole TNG of yours and it's great!
,gnubeest,2010-08-23T21:30Z,"I was hoping you had done this; my girlfriend and I have been making a nightly mission to get her caught up with Next Gen (using your fine re-encoded rips), and as we're starting season 6 and I wanna go through the chronology, it's about time to start throwing DS9 into the mix. Thank you!"

Great quality! Thanks!"
,elhooli,2010-10-01T04:06Z,"OK I'm an idiot and there's an option in VLC, sorry to bother you!"

,BrianB420,2011-03-19T03:54Z,"Great quality, thanks a lot! 
The speeds leave a little to be desired, though. I'm currently seeding seasons one and two, but I'm just one man. If everyone would just seed as much as they download everyone would be happy.
To the seeders: Thank you, you rock. 
To the leechers who hit and run: You suck, you're ugly, and you probably smell."
,President_Kush,2012-05-10T14:26Z,"Thanks meech.  Great consistent uploads.  Just finished TNG, now on to DS9.  Good quality.  All the episodes are here no BS archives (with missing files) and actually has seeds which goes to show its quality, thanks again. "
