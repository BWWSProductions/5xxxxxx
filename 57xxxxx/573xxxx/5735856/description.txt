"Who Wrote the Bible? is a fascinating and brilliant book. It is more
than a record of past discoveries. It is full of new insights and fresh
discoveries. I read i t at one sitting. I have spent much of my lifetime
reading books about the Bible and must confess that I do not
remember another that I could not lay aside unfinished."
