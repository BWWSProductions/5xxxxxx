This is Peter Pringle's and William Arkin's amazing book S.I.O.P. - The Secret U.S. Plan for Nuclear War (1983) which is the first comprehinsive look at the plan (Single Integrated Operating Plan or S.I.O.P.) the United States has had since 1960 to wage nuclear war on Russia. How was it put together? Who decides what targets to hit and why? When and where would it be put into action? Using declassified documents and interviews with government officials and military planners, the authors have pieced together an absorbing history of the Pentagon's most secret war plan. This is a hair-raising book about an aspect of U.S. war planning that so far has escaped popular attention. If we were to stop everything we are doing and debate the life-and-death issues raised by this book, we would be making the best possible use of out time. 270 pages. A must read for everyone.
