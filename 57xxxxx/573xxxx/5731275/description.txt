Two young women arrive at a curious penthouse apartment, led by one's crush on 
her tutor. However, her love interest doesn't live alone. He's part of a trio of 
computer hackers about to embark on the ultimate job on the world's most mysterious 
mainframe. Whilst doing so, they unlock more than they bargain for with 
supernatural and ultimately fatal results. Can this seemingly insignificant 
chain of events, which have thrown this group together, be construed as fate? 
Can the beacon provide a signal of hope or is it a web of manipulation, paranoia 
and ultimately... murder?
