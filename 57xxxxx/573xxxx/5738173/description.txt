RIAA Presents "USA," a "Mix-Album" in 10 Parts
"USA" is a four-hour-long "mix-album," conveniently divided into 10 separate mixes. The history, geography, culture, and politics of the United States is all fair game for RIAA's musical collages, incisive observations, and cheap jokes.

Literally hundreds of sources were used. Any audio that has anything to do with the U.S. of A., from old educational records found in thrift stores, to today's tv hosts and talk-show ranters, were beat-matched, pitch-corrected and thrown into the mix.

Every section delves into a different area of the America experience - the concepts of freedom and revolution, the historical aspects of the black experience and Western expansion, war, leisure time, and as many examples of American music as you're going to hear in one mix - from Native American Indian chanting to a myriad of folk styles, right up to punk and hip-hop. And you'll hear plenty of offensive kooks like Klansmen and religious bigots. But, hey, it's a portrait: "...A surreal, fun-house mirror portrait perhaps, but nonetheless, I wanted to just let everyone speak for themselves."

By "mix-album," I mean a collection of mixes rather than a collection of songs. The mixes' length range from 15 - 30 minutes; the final mix is 47 minutes. Tho the mixes can stand alone, they are meant to be played in sequence.

Disk 1: Part 1 (The America Dream), Part 2 (The Battle of Las Vegas), Part 3 (The Home Sweet Home Suite)

Disk 2: Part 4 (Part Four's Called 'War'), Part 5 (Dark City), Part 6 (p2p)

Disk 3: Part 7 (Revolutions), Part 8 (Worker's Weekend), Part 9 (It's A Mighty Rocky Road)

Disk 4: Part 10 (Take Me To The Mardi Gras - An American Mosaic)
