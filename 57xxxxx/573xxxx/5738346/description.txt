Storyline:In Grovetown, there is a series of suicides after the suicide of an outcast teenager. His brother, Aidan, waits for the return of his cousin Sadie to the family house for the funeral. When Dylan, who is the Christian son of the reverend, beats up Aidan, the undesirable youngster is helped by Dylan's girlfriend Lindsey who drives him home. They talk about Dylan's mother Candace Spindle who had a grimoire to worship her gods at the creek and was blamed by the god-fearing locals of murdering a man, then she died in a suspicious fire. Lindsey and Aidan befriend each other and soon she finds that Aidan's brother has cursed the town with his own sacrifice, unleashing an evil force that is leading the inhabitants to commit suicide.
