Take it easy;)

its one of my torrent uploaded by my old account ""call_me_nobody"" so its safe.

if you'd like it i can download it and upload it again as non anonymous:)"

,call_me_nobody,2011-02-21T09:50Z,When i have downloaded this on new (got lost in last format) i will seed just to keep it alive:)
,dick9876,2011-02-27T06:42Z,Norton said that the emu.exe was a trojan horse.  Anybody else have an issue with this?
,call_me_nobody,2011-04-17T12:31Z,"yes it did say that to me but dont worry, it just happend to have the same codes as a virus exept it isnt;)

i use the emulator daily and i dont get any ads, slowness or anything.

Just deactivate the autoprotect;)

I can record my screen when i launch the emu if ya want;)"
