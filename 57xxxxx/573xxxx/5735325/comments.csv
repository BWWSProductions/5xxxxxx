Shut Up Maria!"
,ItBitTorrent,2010-08-03T04:05Z,"Thanks JW I do appreciate what you are doing. 
However, I wonder if anyone else in interested in a Rush only torrent, without the extras. The extras: IBD; Imprimus: OutloudOpinion etc are at times longer and larger then Rush's show. I barely have enough time to listen to all of it. 
I don't want to look the gift-horse in the mouth. I'm just wondering in anyone else is interested in a more streamlined Rush torrent?"
,sharky3k,2010-08-03T07:09Z,"I've always wondered, what does the CF stand for?"
,Tainan,2010-08-03T12:39Z,"Perhaps I can be of a bit of help:

CF means ""commercial free"" - just the show, no adverts.

ItBits - 
When you have the torrent open up your torrent program you should see a umber of boxes with a 'check mark' in the box. If you do not want to DL the indicated torrents its as easy as just 'unchecking' the box.
I do this as well. I just don't always have the time to listen to all of what is offered. 

Hope this helps.


Shut Up Maria!"
