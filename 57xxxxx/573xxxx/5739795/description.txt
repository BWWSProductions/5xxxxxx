           Desc: In the Year of the City 2274, humans live in a
           vast, bubbled metropolis, where computerized 
           servo-mechanisms provide all needs so everyone can
           pursue endless hedonism. Endless, that is, until 
           Lastday when anyone who's 30 must submit to Carousel,
           a soaring, spinning trip to eternity and supposed
           rebirth. The screen's first use of laser holography 
           highlights this post-apocalyptic winner of a Special
           Acheivement Award for Visual Effects. Michael York 
           plays Logan 5, a Sandman authorized to terminate 
           Runners fleeing Carousel. Logan is almost 30. Catch
           him if you can.           

           Notes: Look for our 720p and 1080p of this.
