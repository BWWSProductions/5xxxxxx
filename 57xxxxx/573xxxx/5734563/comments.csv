I don't think it's the crack, because it does seem to work fine under XP/32."
,Kopojken,2010-11-16T23:23Z,"För att få det att fungera på Win7, lägg istället in filerna som skall in [install path]\Archives\

till

C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\thriXXX\3DSexVilla2-Everlust\Archives\"

I followed Kopojken's steps on W7 & Vista.
- It got the program started showing the thrixxx intro, but when it comes to the ""update/connection screen"", it crashes: sayin' - ""3DSexVilla2-093.001.exe stopped working"" 

Any ideas? what to do now?
Or is it just impossible to get it to work on W7/vista"
,theyloveme,2011-01-25T11:07Z,"Kopjken is right...!! All you have to do to get it working in Win 7 is to follow the instructions in the read me but instead of placing the Archive files in the install folder, use the following path: C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\thriXXX\3DSexVilla2-Everlust\Archives\

To be precise,

In XP:

1.Install
2.Copy 3DSexVilla2-093.001.exe to [install path]\binaries\
3.Copy 3DSexVilla2.Archives.txx to [install path]\Archives\
4.Copy everything from [ 2.093.001]to [install path]\Archives\2.093.001\
5.Play

In Win 7

1.Install
2.Copy 3DSexVilla2-093.001.exe to [install path]\binaries\
3.Copy 3DSexVilla2.Archives.txx to C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\thriXXX\3DSexVilla2-Everlust\Archives\Archives\
4.Copy everything from [ 2.093.001]to C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\thriXXX\3DSexVilla2-Everlust\Archives\Archives\2.093.001\
5.Play"
