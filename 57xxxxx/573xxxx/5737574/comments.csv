,wira020,2010-08-13T19:32Z,"@DSIN 
There's already some good rips of blader runner around with good quality and small size... i think they're the same as how yify or riddlerA's rips..

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5675158/Blade_Runner_The_Final_Cut_1982_BRRip_x264_-_KickASS_%28MicroStar_

It might be a bit a big, but the movie is quite lenghty, thus deserve the extra MB.. good quality... "
