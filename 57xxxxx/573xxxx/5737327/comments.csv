The Avatar Windows 7 Theme consist of 20+ HD Wallpapers, Custom Avatar Icons and select music from the movie.

Avatar is one of those movies which ushers in a new era in film-making. James Cameron, the director, is a visionary and like he has done it before in ?The Terminator? ? with Avatar he raised the bar for Special Effects in Movies to a whole new level.

The film broke several box office records during its release and became the highest-grossing film of all time in North America and worldwide, surpassing Titanic, which had held the records for the previous 12 years. It also became the first film to gross more than $2 billion. Following the film?s success, Cameron stated that there will be at least two sequels, which means we would get to see a lot more of Pandora. Pretty cool eh!?

Enjoy the Theme!!!"

Development on Avatar began in 1994, when Cameron wrote an 80-page script for the film. Filming was supposed to take place after the completion of Cameron?s 1997 film Titanic, for a planned release in 1999, but according to Cameron, the necessary technology was not yet available to achieve his vision of the film. When we see the movie, we see what he meant by his vision ? The Spectacular Pandora and the beautiful Na?vi people."
