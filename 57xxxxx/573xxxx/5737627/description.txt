gracie's choice ( Dutch Subs )

Gracie Thompson hasn't been so much brought up as dragged through life by her manipulative, drug-addled mother. 
Missing meals, dodging cops and landlords, changing schools the way most kids change socks, Gracie and her sister and brothers, each the product of a different dead-beat dad, seem to have hit the skids.
Then Gracie makes a choice to get a job, succeed in school, find stability. 
And her choice isn't just for herself. 
At the age of 17, she decides to be the mother, emotionally and legally, her siblings never had.
