Allmusic Review:
Showcasing Maxi Priest's talent for shaping reggae, dancehall, and soul into a distinctly pop-oriented and commercial amalgam, Man with the Fun happens to be one of Priest's better efforts, simply because the quality of the production and songwriting is uniformly first-rate throughout the record. Of course, there are quite a few mediocre tracks, but the smooth sounds of Priest's voice and the seamless production hold your interest until the album arrives at high points like Maxi's duet with Shaggy, "That Girl."
