,rzainaddin,2011-08-16T22:15Z,Thanks neon for this upload.....
,Bugnuts,2011-10-13T23:11Z,no offense to this upload but whats up with everyone claiming 720p when the height of the video is only 544 which unfortunately is NOT 720p.
,OttifantSir2,2012-01-26T05:50Z,"Bugnuts: I agree that 544 isn't 720, but then again,  as *I* understand the definition, it's not solely the height that makes HD, but also the width, which is 1280. Which means it's HD-Cinema format, 2.21:1/2.35:1 (mostly), instead of HD-TV/-Movie format which is 16:9. Yeah, go figure...

For a TRUE description, uploaders SHOULD say it's 544p, but that would just confuse people uneducated in the mediaformats even more.

It seems MOST people know the difference between 480p (iPod-format), 720p (HD-TV) and 1080p (BluRay-format), but not that cinematic formats differ from these. So when uploaders claim 720p I believe it's to avoid confusion, nothing more sinister than that.

PS: I don't think HD-Cinema is a proper name, just a more honest definition I made up right now..."
