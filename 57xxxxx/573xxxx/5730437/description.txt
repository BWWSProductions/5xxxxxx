The Polka Floyd show was formed in 2006 out of the ashes of nameless bands in the Toledo, OH and Detroit, MI area. What started as a good-time side project quickly became the focus of our musical lives.....and through numerous local gigs, festivals, and touring throughout the east and midwest, we continue to provide the accordian to rock-n-roll audiences everywhere.
