The Academy Is... is an American rock band from Barrington, Illinois, formed in 2003. They are currently signed by the Decaydance imprint of the Fueled by Ramen label. They were originally known as "The Academy", but added the "Is..." in 2004 to avoid legal complications with other established bands already under that name. As of 2010, the band has released three studio albums, Almost Here, Santi, and Fast Times at Barrington High, and four EPs.
