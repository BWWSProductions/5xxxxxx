There is no profile name avilable, the box is blank and it does not let you make one up. Help?"
,Thermo18,2010-09-12T01:31Z,When I try and run the patch it says it cannot run in 64 bit. So I downloaded another patch. Now when opening Cities XL Launcher it says it cannot run in 64 bit. Looking through this page I tried to find where you said the crack is only 32 bit and I don't see it. Is this the case? Thanks.
