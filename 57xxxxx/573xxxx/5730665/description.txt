Description
The soundtrack for Season 5 was released on May 11, 2010, just over a week before the final episode of the series. It was the final episode of the 5th season in which "The Tangled Web" was introduced, which harkens back to Giacchino's love of John Williams' own fantasy scores. The melody takes a very large role in the subsequent season and has striking similarities to Williams' own theme for the Ark of the Covenant in "Raiders of the Lost Ark," with its mystical overtones and quasi-religious qualities.
