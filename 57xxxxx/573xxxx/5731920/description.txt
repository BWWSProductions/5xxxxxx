Los Angeles quintet Darker My Love are proud to announce the release of their new album, ALIVE AS YOU ARE, the follow up to the band s breakthrough sophomore album 2, which received across-the-map critical acclaim for its mind-bending neo-psychedelic grooves and hazily anthemic hooks. Set for an August 17th release on Dangerbird Records, ALIVE AS YOU ARE was recorded at San Francisco s legendary Hyde Street Studios with producer Nick Huntington (of acclaimed electronica duo Freescha) and is the band s most musically focused and emotionally direct collection to date.
