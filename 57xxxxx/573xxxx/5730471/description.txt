Trine v1.07 SKiDROW Steam Update + Crackfix for Trine CPY release

After downloading Trine CPY and unpacking+extracting that, then gettting the SKiDROW update+crack, then the crackfix, both having rar files within rar files, it felt like a mess of rar files and cracks, and I wanted to clean it up a bit.

Short howto:

1. Get Trine CPY: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4986399/
   Unpack, and extract Setup.exe and run it.

1a. Get 7-Zip to unpack this Update+Crackfix.

2. Run the v1.07 Steam Update.

3. Copy the three files in the Crackfix folder to the Trine folder.

4. Make a shortcut to trine_launcher.exe and put it on your Desktop.

5. Use the shortcut to launch the game.
