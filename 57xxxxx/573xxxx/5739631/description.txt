These are the Blues is a 1963 (see 1963 in music) studio album by the American jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald, featuring the trumpeter Roy Eldridge, and the organist Wild Bill Davis.

The album is notable as Ella's only attempt at recording an entire album of blues songs, a genre in which she is not generally considered a notable singer.
