,bcrw47,2010-08-01T23:03Z,"Hi F.B.I,

If you upload them I'll have a go at inserting them in my scenery setup.
Thanks for replying anyway."
,IntAv,2010-08-02T00:11Z,"hello, there seems missing file/s from scenery/world/scenery folder. Would be possible to upload these files? excuse my broken english."
,davincighost,2010-08-02T00:18Z,"many thanks for uploader! in my FSX the traffic crossing RWY are sink in the ground, does anyone see that? know how to fix?"
,razorrrrr,2010-08-02T00:41Z,"Yes, and the cars on the airfield are halfway in the ground, and there isn't any car traffic like seen on the screenshots.

Any change this is getting fixed? "
,razorrrrr,2010-08-02T00:42Z,Any chance*
,TheOrbitt,2010-08-02T01:24Z,"me too. then i should say its in the scenery, and it doesn't got anything to do with the settings? isn't there a possibility that the installer itself gets uploaded?"
,IntAv,2010-08-02T02:22Z,The problem is probably caused by missing file I say about earlier. I think installer puts files in scenery/world/scenery to fix elevation problem.
,moonrider53,2010-08-02T10:44Z,"Same here, but there are also things not finished, theres a hole at the runway turnpoint and much more, just wrote a question on Aerosoft forum. he he he
But if we mis something maybe uploader can look into it."
,moonrider53,2010-08-02T11:30Z,"update: we are realy missing files, on the aerosoft forums it works great for everyone, so we need more files, uploader can you pls look into it??"
,F.B.I,2010-08-02T13:06Z,ill have a look!!!
,F.B.I,2010-08-02T13:06Z,ill have a look for them guys!!!
,moonrider53,2010-08-02T13:55Z,"Vaernes had the same thing, its somewhere in fsx/scenery/world
Best thing is install it into an empty folder and make a flightsim folder in it, then install it there and you got all of it."
,F.B.I,2010-08-02T16:49Z,"Guys i have reinstalled into a new folder, there is a scenery file that you need, but also a Vistamare folder this is to run the traffic, there is also an effects folder, ill upload the new torrent around sometime today!!!"
,TheOrbitt,2010-08-02T17:55Z,"hehe, that explains a lot. I hope you will upload it soon!"
,TheOrbitt,2010-08-02T19:16Z,you have to go to 'upload torrents' at the bottom of the page and do what is instructed..
