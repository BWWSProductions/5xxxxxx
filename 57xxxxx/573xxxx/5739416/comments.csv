,otoko_tenshi,2010-10-04T09:58Z,"im not sure, but these two comments look suspicially like people paid off by corperate bigwigs... can anyone confirm this or at least confirm the validity of the torrent?
if this were a virus id think there should at least be an approving comment or two from the spammers ..."
