All pirate.bay frequenters, this happens to be my first DVD upload, which will hopefully be followed by others. I've received a lot from the site anonymously and it's high time I sent something precious in return. I hope you'll like them. I'd appreciate your comments about the quality. Have some intellectual fun, bros/siss. (I'll be keeping the upload active approximately for two months because of the problem of space.)
