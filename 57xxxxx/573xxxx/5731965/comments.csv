These are some of the most powerful meditations there are. You are pretty much guaranteed to experience the meditative state and many times over and you will be compelled to recognize it, unless you are totally brain damaged and your mind is so busy that it is full of thoughts non stop.

It has been known in India that music is extremely conductive to meditative state. It has also been scientifically proven by the Bulgarian research into learning a new material during the seventies. They have discovered that if the information is presented with the background music of certain type, it goes 10 times deeper.

When you simply listen to a discourse alone, your mind will be busy chewing upon all those things it does all day long and you won't even notice.

But when you listen on a background of the most beautiful and meditative music, you are BOUND to recognize those moments of utter silence and utter presence. You simply have no choice.

Finally, if you have something to say, just say it here. No need to be utterly silent. Don't you have anything to say?

Enjoy now."

The best way is using high quality headphones such as Sennheiser. They cost around $60-80.

If you listen via speakers, the ambiance volume will affect what you hear. You may not even hear music in a noisy environment.

Set volume so you can barely hear the background music, but you CAN hear it.
If you set the volume too high, you will hear music louder and it may become so loud that you get distracted from the voice.
If you set the volume too low, you may not even hear music at all, which defeats the whole purpose. This is how ears work as psycho-acoustic research shows.

It does not matter what you listen to, the voice or the music. Your mind will be thrown back and forth between the music and the voice and you are bound to recognize its flickering and very soon you will clearly recognize the times you are in meditation and you WILL be. It is pretty much inevitable unless you are totally mad and your mind is so busy that you don't even have a single moment of silence between the thoughts.

By the time you finish listening to the series of discourses you are going to be a meditator. But to not push the river. Do not expect ANYTHING. Forget about meditation. It is just an aroma, and aroma of a flower. It is not the cause.

,veerenski,2010-08-25T08:34Z,"About meditation:

If you try to meditate, there is a very little chance you will be able to. That is why there is this ""effortless effort"" notion in Zen.

Yes, you do need to make some effort to meditate. If you just keep running around like you do all day long, there is a very little chance for you to experience the meditative state. Even the whole notion of experiences is inapplicable to meditation.

But if your effort is like a goal, then it is too much. Yes, you may sit and try to meditate on something. But it will be all in vain, just the same.

Meditation is not activity. It is a STATE, a state of your being. You can not DO it. It happens.

You can not meditate ON something, not even on a light of a candle, like Yogis claim. As long as there is separation between the observer and the observed, no meditation is possible.

Candle light is just an excuse and the reason the candle light is used because the flame is forever flickering, which shows your mind its own flickering. Candle light is just an excuse. You can meditate on a black wall for that matter, just like Bodhidharma says.

So, do not try to make meditation a goal. You won't succeed. It is not something to be achieved. It can not be done. It is ""against the nature of things"".

It is just an aroma of a flower. How can you achieve an aroma?

But it is there, undeniably there. All arguments against it are futile.

That is the meaning of ""effortless effort"" and that is the very purpose of the Fluctuation Meditations. You are not to do ANYTHING. You are not to crave for ANYTHING. You are not to expect to be in meditation. Just forget all about meditation, enlightenment, Buddha and all that jazz.

ALL you have to do is to find at least half an hour a day to give yourself a break from everything and lay back, close your eyes and relax. Body needs to be in a very comfortable state. That is ALL you have to do. Just adjust the volume so voice and music balance is to your liking."
