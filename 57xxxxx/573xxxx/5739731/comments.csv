I found a rip of this audiobook online, but it was in 3 min chunk [over 300 of them], so I joined them in to one 16 hour mp3, used silence detection to break them down again, then did some tinkering and finally got them split into chapter. Hope you all enjoy!"

Although the bitrate is low (64 kbps), audio is certainly good enough. Maybe the introductory chapter is a bit ""thin"".

Anyway, thanks for sharing! Looking forward to more from you! :-)"
