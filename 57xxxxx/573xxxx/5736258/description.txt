NOTE: Glad to see ya back around KB. Cant wait for ya to get back in action. Continuing the legacy of great quality, KiNGDOM releases... Well, Did a little bit on this like fised AR, lowered the blue as much as I could without discoloring other portians. I added a little sharpeness to the script, also increased the brightness and Gamma. The audio seemed low so I raised it to 120%. Video and audio really wasnt all that bad to begin with, just needed a lil more and a lil less. TAKE IT or LEAVE IT. 
I am looking for some new sources cams, direct audio ,dvd or vhs screeners, Dedicated Servers, TV Cappers, syncers or any thing else you can provide Contact us @ kingdom@hush.ai
