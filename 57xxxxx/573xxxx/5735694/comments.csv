I have no idea what are you writing about.


Thx Ray, as always 10/10 ;)"
,dlarrym1111,2010-10-05T20:54Z,"@GregiBoy: I have no idea what you are reading or see???? I too didn't find anything that would make me or anyone think this is one of those 3 Vampire movies. You know the ones I mean, They have the most super gay, faggy-like vampires I have ever seen.  

If one of them showed up in the middle of the night at my house, I don't know what I would think. Are they going to re-decorate my living room?? or If I am bitten, do I also become GAY!! LMFAO!!!!! 

Seriously, they all dress like pretty boy / prep school fags. The Anne Rice series of books (turned to movies) is much closer to what I feel a vampire should or would be like. Not a vampire that is a Prep School / Spoiled / Pretty Boy and looks like a leftover from the cast of ""SAVED BY THE BELL"". My nephew dragged me to see one of these films so I sadly have seen one. When I was watching, I kept expecting ""Screech"", not the sound, but the NERD (Dustin Diamond-""Saved by the Bell"") to pop out of a locker that some jock stuffed him in. LOL!!!! 

There is not one word in any of the up-loaders movie details that even remotely implies/infers that this movie is ECLIPSE or any of the shitty movies in that franchise. I guess if your a 14 year old Girl, from an upper middle class family, then these crappy vampire films might be something your seeking.

This movie is THE THING by John Carpenter. It won many many awards for its special effects when it was released. It was made before CGI existed. George Lucas only a few years earlier developed the use of Blue or Green Screens for making better special effects. Trust me, ""THE THING"" is FAR better then any of the 3 vamp flicks that were fore-mentioned.

Thanks for the upload. A great movie and great quality upload!

LASTLY: I heard a rumor, but have not seen any evidence of this my self, but a sci-fi movie freak friend of mine tells me that a remake of ""The Thing"" is being made. Perhaps by JAMES CAMERON? | maybe Ridley Scott?? not sure?? Could be a great project? This film is awesome as it stands and doesn't need to be remade in my humble opinion. I do not see that the effects could be any better then they are already. It will have to be way over the top to out do John Carpenter's existing version."
,PP21,2010-10-12T19:23Z,"@dlarrym1111: My first thought was that what you written was long ago, but i saw it was only a week ago. You don't keep up in the world of movies i asume? The new The Thing movie isn't a rumor and it isn't a remake, but a prequel. It's directed by Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. Premiere April next year. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0905372/"
