That's intelligent.  I think you're the one who needs to learn about aspect ratios.  This is a scope presentation, 2.35:1.  It's still 720p. it's just that part of the image is bars when displayed on a 1.78:1 screen.  In your world, I suppose the only films capable of being 720p, 1080p, or whatever are ones shot in 1.78:1."
