Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May buy old British roadsters from Jensen-Healey, Lotus and TVR before taking a wistful journey through the remnants of the UK's sports car industry, starting in Norfolk and ending up at the mothballed TVR factory in Blackpool. Also, Jeremy takes to the test track in the sensational new Ferrari 458 Italia, and laid-back Hollywood legend Jeff Goldblum is the star in the new reasonably priced car.
