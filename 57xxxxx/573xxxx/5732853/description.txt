Oomph's entire discography, including all their albums up to Truth or Dare, singles, complitations, live performances, and a few miscelleneous tracks.

In the case of the singles, I left out tracks that were already found on the main album. Same with Best of Virgin Years. Don't worry, you're not missing out on anything!
