    Irish actress Dervla Kirwan became a household name in     
    the hit series Ballykissangel. But she has never spoken   
    about her great-uncle Michael Collins, a national        
    figure who changed Irish history and fought to            
    establish the Irish Free State. Dervla wants to find       
    out how her grandfather Finian, Michael's nephew, fits    
    into the events shaped by his famous uncle.              
                                                              
    In the heart of Dublin, Dervla goes to Cathal Brugha       
    Barracks to unearth Finian's pension records which        
    detail his activities before he joined the Irish Free    
    State Army. Dervla makes an unexpected discovery          
    regarding the IRA, and uses the documents to help her      
    retrace Finian's steps. She heads to Clonakilty in West   
    Ireland where the War of Independence was at its height  
    when Finian was still a teenager.                         
                                                               
    Dervla knows little of her paternal side of the family    
    and meets her father who tells her that her              
    great-grandfather Henry Kahn was Jewish. Knowing          
    nothing of the Dublin Jewish community, Dervla heads to    
    the Jewish Museum. Armed with new information Dervla      
    discovers a Victorian love story, a dismal miscarriage   
    of justice and an act of anti-semitism that even          
    reached the House of Commons - and inspired an episode     
    in one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century,   
    Ulysses by James Joyce.
