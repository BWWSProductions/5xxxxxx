The original movie is in German.

Wasted download."
,Virga,2010-09-03T02:16Z,"Just watched the movie in full length and am very displeased with the editing. This movie is shorter than the original and the aerial fighting scenes are scrambeled. They cut out parts of one battle and placed them in others making a total mess.

There is one scene in which Manfred executes his patented maneuvre to escape an enemy and get behind him. In this version it was edited in such way that you see him making an emergency landing in a French hey field just after this evasive action.

All in all a very bad edit. If you want to see the real movie I suggest this torrent:
