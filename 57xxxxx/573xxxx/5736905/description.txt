Beny More is considered by many to have been the greatest Cuban vocalist ever. 
Listening to these recordings, made with Perez Prado and his orchestra in the late '40s, it's certainly hard to deny that they guy rocked pretty hard. 
Here Prado's brassy mambos are smoother than his earlier work, and More's vocals make the mix that much sweeter. 
Super swinging, super suave, and highly recommended.
