,omegafox84,2010-08-04T02:39Z,you're welcome. i'm pretty sure it was a 1:1 copy.
,OILFAN79,2010-08-13T01:27Z,no menu even though it says that in the description and you cant turn the subtitles off
,omegafox84,2010-08-16T07:15Z,"don't know what you're using to play it, but there is indeed a menu and the ability to switch subtitles on/off."
,OILFAN79,2010-08-16T09:29Z,tried on vlc first now i went back and played it on my xbox and there werent any subs but still no menu
,omegafox84,2010-08-17T00:00Z,"this movie starts automatically. to access the menu just hit the menu button. i tried this in my xbox, xbox 360, and windows media player. everything is there as stated in the description. don't know what more i can tell you."
,OILFAN79,2010-08-18T09:14Z,ahh that did the trick. Was it like that on the original dvd?
,omegafox84,2010-08-18T10:52Z,"yes, it was the same on the original. glad i could help."
