'We have update to Gnome 2.30.
Now You can install GhostBSD by terminal commands and a list with pc-sysinstall. The partition Supported to install GhostBSD are UFS, UFS+S (plus soft updates7), UFS+J (plus journaling8), ZFS, and SWAP.
A how to install is in the desktop.

With GhostBSD in your hard drive you have Linux-f10 compatibility that mean you can install Linux apps and Linux flash. Cups ready to use. Compiz install and ready to be use.

This Is the first installable version. Not so user friendly. But I have promised
something. The last month All was going wrong and I decide to go with pc-sysinstall. Now for the next 6 mount I gonna work on a graphic installer for 2.0.'
