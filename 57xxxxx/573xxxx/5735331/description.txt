	NOTES:
	
	As noted in the nfo for the REAL E04 a few episodes are
	mislabeled. This is the same episode as:
	Tosh.0.S02E04.HDTV.XviD-aAF
	
	Initially I was just going to make iNTERNALs for the 
	archives but on a closer inspection the old rips has issues
	at the commercial breaks due to what probably is a shitty
	tool being used for editing. A few seconds is missing at 
	both the first and second cut point. Well, third too, but 
	there is just a logo as intro so nothing of value is missing. 
	It is also causing video to glitch quite severly. (No, I'm 
	not talking about the added distortion in the graphics of 
	the show.)  

	Sample included from both rips for an easy comparison. 
	
	I haven't seen these issues on later pre's from aAF so 
	I assume they became aware of it. Keep it up!
	
	INFO:
	
	MINDTHEGAP is living up to its groupname. We do mind all
	the gaps in archives out there. If we see a rerun airing
	of unreleased eps from series we try to get it. If the
	show is really old and the hope of finding the original
	release is gone, we try to fix that too with iNTERNALs. 
	
	This of course makes our releases a bit random and some
	might think we are mad but there will be a reason behind
	the madness.
