,zzk2001,2010-08-03T08:59Z,"Yes this is the REAL version BUT... sadly SUCKS. Linkin Park has really gone down hill and they better stop this crap soon or they will start losing Fans,.. Starting with me."
,Murcky,2010-08-03T12:55Z,"Well seeing as this is somewhat how they are going to make their music from now, you might stop being their fan now...Mike stated that their new album would be more like New Divide, so yeah.

Anyways, thanks for UL it's the real thing, not a fake. Thanks"

,hand.puppet7,2010-08-09T03:33Z,I love this song; any true Linkin Park fan would! I love how they have reinvented their music through the years! Thanks Anonymous
