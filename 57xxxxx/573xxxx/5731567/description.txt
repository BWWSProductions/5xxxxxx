This is a working version for "The Fall: Last days of Gaia" - as I got extremely frustrated searching for one that worked (and included serials, etc) I decided to post one myself.

If you follow the included instructions, everything will work. Please note that you may need to physically disconnect your CD/DVD drive temporarily while you play (but all that junk is in the instructions)

Enjoy :)
