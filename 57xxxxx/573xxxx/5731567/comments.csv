p.s - this is the german version WITH english patch (all text in ENG, dialogue german). As you may know, the official English version was cancelled, but this is perfectly playable :)"

,darkfenix619,2010-08-03T03:47Z,I get up to installing and then it comes up with 'Bitte cd 2 einlegen' which im assuming says insert cd 2 which there isn't.Is there another way to install this without disconnecting my dvd drive which sounds like a huge bother.Ive been waiting for this game for ages but it seems this isnt going to work either.
,darkfenix619,2010-08-03T03:54Z,"I got it to work, But i not up to starting gameplay yet.Hopefully it works."
,darkfenix619,2010-08-03T04:07Z,OK the actual game works thanks for the upload =)
,McMongo86,2010-08-03T11:26Z,"no problem man, for everyone's reference, you don't need to disconnect your drive to *install* the game, but you MAY need to disconnect it to *play*

On my laptop, i had to pull the drive out - but on my desktop PC, i didn't need to, neither did it ask for a cd-key... strange

My guess is it has something to do with IDE drives. If yours is SATA you should be fine!"
,Sigbintoy,2010-09-11T15:46Z,Guys this works on Magick ISO right? what if I use some no CD crack ? does it still compel me to rip my CD/DVD drive?
,Gamejunkiez,2010-09-17T16:54Z,"Works like a charm.

Strange enough:

- Mounted the ISO.

- Installed the English mod.

And the game just ran.
No need for official ISO or mini image to play.

OS: Win7 x64.

So you might want to try it this way instead.
Before you disconnect any drives or use the included tools.

Hope this helps. :)"
