,ShepardM,2010-08-04T10:56Z,Does it work?
,Clabwxndo,2010-08-04T11:42Z,"Yes, it works fine with the new unlocker.

Cheers mate."
,Chabs232,2010-08-04T20:56Z,Do we need to crack it afterwards or this doesn't apply any patch ? By the size of it I don't think it patches anything.
,PShepard,2010-08-04T22:08Z,"Works Great,thank you!"
,Death214,2010-08-09T15:02Z,"It is a nice enough dlc,but i got used to my old carnifex,and since i chose adept,there isnt much use in it for me.Either way,good upload,annon."
,FrUsTrIc,2010-09-02T22:35Z,"ok, I downloaded the DLC and installed it but when I start the new DLC unlocker it asks me something about which network adapter I want to select... seems a litle odd to me...."
,isotope,2010-09-04T14:43Z,New unlocker does not work for me.
,deadman_uk,2010-09-06T17:55Z,"Couldn't get this to work until I tried the old unlocker, then it worked fine.

Thanks"
,Chaste,2010-09-09T16:32Z,"Hi, I would like to know what you guys meant by the old DLC unlocker?"
,FrUsTrIc,2010-09-10T21:03Z,"Confirmed, It works perfectly by using the old unlocker. some really awesome WPNÂ´s in this pack too :)"
,pietpiraat1,2010-09-12T01:50Z,"hello guys, on my computer all the dlcs work fine
so i wanted to give them to my friend to but there it all dont seem to work he always keep reciving the message unable to authorize the listed dlc
and when i try out the entitlement v2 it gives a error about cache or something like that (my friend have his cracked version of mass effect 2 installed on his external hard disk becuse his pc is to full to put it on the normal harddrive) also patching the game didnt seem to work, does anyone have a idea or suggestion that can help to solve this problem?"
,ilhares,2011-03-14T12:27Z,"I must be doing something wrong.  I've run the DLC and tried the unlocker, but I never get the mail telling me the new weapons are available, nor do they appear in game, and I can't brute-force them in via Gibbed.  Would *love* to know what I'm doing wrong, or if there's a specific trigger for them."
