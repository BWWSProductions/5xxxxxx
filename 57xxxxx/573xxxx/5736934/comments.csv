[T],Games4theworld,2010-08-21T18:29Z,"Hello,


No, these are permanent & full editions."
[T],Games4theworld,2010-09-04T10:45Z,"Hello,

  I don't know exactly about that, but you can Update the Windows to the latest version."
,raging_tigeress,2010-09-12T22:28Z,"If you have problems with the cursor jumping around after you download this, go to your control panel, mouse and then unclick the box that says ""Hide pointer while typing"" that should fix the problem.

Also this disk is not bootable so you have to do it through ""mycomputer"". After it is done go into your C: drive and delete a file called windows.old  If you don't do this your OS will be using 40 gigs of space.

I had to do both of these but it works perfect now."
,xbriana,2010-09-15T03:07Z,"When switching from vista to windows 7, should i back up all of the files i want to keep? or will they stay?"
,xbriana,2010-09-15T04:49Z,"I am running Windows Vista Home Basic 32-bit. I burned the entire thing to a dvd and then I restarted my computer and clicked on the CD/DVD option to boot it up on, and all that happens is it tells me that windows didn't shut off properly and it gives me options to restart in safe mode and normally. I tried to start the setup while being in safe mode and normally in windows after that and the computer just froze. Please help? "
[T],Games4theworld,2010-09-15T12:57Z,"Hello,

@xbriana

You should be able to keep all your files if you choose ""Upgrade"" during the Installation. But it's รกlways recommend to make a backup of your important files.
Also, it looks like the DVD isn't bootable, so I recommend you just start up your PC normally and then just run the DVD from inside Windows itself."

[T],Games4theworld,2011-04-09T13:33Z,"Hello,

@Henry818

You could use an external plug&play CD-DVD ROM drive or Mount the .ISO on your laptop and then run the installation via Windows.

,slappyme,2011-07-01T21:07Z,will this delete all your data if you update or not
[T],Games4theworld,2011-07-05T13:54Z,"Hello,

@Henry818

The installation warns you several times about making a backup of your files before proceeding. I can't help you with this one, sorry.

@slappyme

Not if you make a backup of your files and choose ""Upgrade"" during the installation.
