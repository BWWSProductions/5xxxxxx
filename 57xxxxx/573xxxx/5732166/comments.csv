,hmm1234,2010-08-02T00:02Z,"Thank you from the bottom of my heart for doing this TDMK1!
It is an absolute life saver for everyone of us that can't watch the BBC and their awesome coverage by any other means!
I really appreciate how you upload the forum aswell. It is just a professional coverage through and through.
Thank you!"
,kiel0000,2010-08-02T00:14Z,Really appreciate you uploading all the races this season! I hate that I can't get them on TV anywhere. You're a lifesaver!

,VR,2010-08-02T04:01Z,I raise my glass in your honor for another job well done. thanks.
,MDBR,2010-08-02T08:17Z,"Seen 1 hour of the race (lap 10), and the video seems to skip a lot. I have VLC 1.1.2 with all the latest codecs and I'm wondering if anyone else has this problems. TDMK1 always does a great job and I havent had this problem before with any of his UL. The vid skips for half a second, then normal for 1 sec, then it skip. This goes on for maybe ten seconds then back to normal for a couple of minutes, then the skipping starts all over again. Should I DL it again?"
,paulonline,2010-08-02T08:40Z,thanks a lot!
,thomasbordvik,2010-08-02T09:31Z,"mdbr, I got it to! Using vlc 1.1.2 as well..."
,MDBR,2010-08-02T12:49Z,"Seen the whole race now, the skipping ends completely after lap 11... It's not that big of a problem really, it's just annoying when I began to watch the video and thought that it would skip for the entire race. 
Thumbs up for TDMK1, you're doing a great for all of us who can't follow the race live!!"
,thomasbordvik,2010-08-02T13:35Z,"Thats good to hear!! :D I was afraid it was going to skip the start!! hehe, but it didnt so I`m happy! Thumps up for tdmk1`s faboulus work!!! Keep it up good man! :D"
,GGranello,2010-08-02T22:25Z,Mine Skips as well. Lots of Pixelation. Windows Vista Ultimate with Media Player. Thanks a lot for the uploads!
,kiel0000,2010-08-03T08:44Z,"I also noticed the skipping issue. Looks like a buffer issue of some device on your end or something (can't imagine it's the BBC, lol). But for the opportunity to watch the racing I'm not complaining. Also, I don't know if it's just me but I've noticed a seemingly higher quality of the video in the past couple GPs. Looks great! Thanks again!"
,fordos,2010-08-15T15:51Z,"Thank you TDMK1 and all of You nice seeders!
