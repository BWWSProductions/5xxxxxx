If you are a fan of the Naruto Anime series then Akatsuki do not require any introduction. For those who are new ? Akatsuki is the evil organization from the anime series Naruto. Akatsuki at any given time is composed of no more than ten primary members, all of whom were S-Class criminals of their own respective villages. Although most members joined Akatsuki to further their own goals, Akatsuki?s ultimate goal remains the same: World Domination.

The Akatsuki members wear long, dark cloaks with red clouds, a red interior, and a chin-high collar. The members may wear a conical straw hat with small spike-like balls hanging down to cover their faces. The creator of this series, Masashi Kishimoto, wanted the villains to be regarded as ?flamboyant? with a showy costume, unique characteristics and extreme power in an attempt to make them Memorable and Immortal (One of them literally so). The series creator succeeded in his efforts and Akatsuki is now one of the most famous evil organization out there."
