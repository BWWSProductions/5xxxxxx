Anyone else curious as to why there are dozens of mp3 versions posted here?"
,MiQ206,2011-01-18T16:45Z,"@icet87 I like the idea of .iso file even more (straight rip from the CD). But mp3 is used so much because people dont know the difference between Red Book standard and Mp3, they just dont understand sounds(oh ye, mp3 are 11 times smaller in size). So people think mp3 is the best.
Maybe you could try uploading .iso? ;)"
