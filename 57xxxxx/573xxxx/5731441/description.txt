Nightmare is the fifth studio album by American rock band Avenged Sevenfold,  
released on July 27, 2010 through Warner Bros. Records; it was produced by 
Mike Elizondo and mixed in New York City by noted engineer Andy Wallace. 
Nightmare is the first Avenged Sevenfold record without James "The Rev" 
Sullivan performing drums because of his death in December 2009, although 
he wrote some of the songs before that time and is therefore the last studio 
album on which he contributed; as a tribute, The Rev's vocals are still on the 
album. Mike Portnoy, from Dream Theater, who performed as the drummer for the 
album in his place, will also play with the band for all the upcoming tours 
through the end of 2010. Avenged Sevenfold, along with Disturbed, will co-headline 
the first annual Uproar Festival.
