Puff, the magic Dragon
lived by the Sea -
and frolicked in the Autumn Mist
in a Land called Honah Lee

Little Jackie Paper
loved that rascal Puff -
and he brought him Strings and Sealing Wax
and other fancy Stuff

Together they would travel
on a Boat with billowed Sail -
Jackie kept a lookout perched
on Puff's gigantic Tail.

Noble Kings and Princes
would bow whene'er they came -
Pirate Ships would lower their flags
when Puff roared out his Name

Oh!

Puff, the magic Dragon
lived by the Sea -
and frolicked in the Autumn Mist
in a Land called Honah Lee

Puff, the magic Dragon
lived by the Sea -
and frolicked in the Autumn Mist
in a Land called Honah Lee

A Dragon lives forever
but not so little Boys -
painted Wings and Giant's Rings
make Way for other Toys

One grey Night it happened
Jackie Paper came no more -
And Puff, that mighty Dragon
he ceased his fearless Roar

His Head was bent in Sorrow
green Scales fell like Rain -
Puff no longer went to play
along the cherry Lane

Without his life-long Friend
Puff could not be brave -
So Puff, that mighty Dragon
sadly slipped into his Cave

Puff, the magic Dragon,
lived by the Sea -
and frolicked in the Autumn Mist
in a Land called Honah Lee
