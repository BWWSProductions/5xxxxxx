
Changed tags and name so that it can be found easily.



Sorry about first upload, did not test. Now it\'s fixed.

I created this torrent because of the crappy speedcams out there.
To find out if you european country is included go to http://www.poiplaza.com and check the speedcam section - if your european country is in there then it\'s in here ( this can become invalid in time ).

Check out the README for more info.

If you are looking for speedcams for GPS apps other than Garmin please head to http://poiplaza.com .

Their database is user created ( and so free ) and can be downloaded in all possible formats ( igo, mio, tomtom, etc).

And the nice thing is that they have much more than just speedcams. Check it out!

Also you can contribute with new data (new speedcams, new pois, etc) and your contribs will not be lost, and others will be able to enjoy your work, and you will be able to enjoy other\'s work.

Just imagine how quickly the database will get close to complete if we all contribute with at least one poi.

Live Long and Prosper!		


Ps: There are more free poi sites out there ( just google \'gps poi\'). If u want your pois to be more complete try to get info from as much sites as possible.
If u do this please reupload your result so that it doesn\'t get lost and others can use it and maybe add to it.
Thx
