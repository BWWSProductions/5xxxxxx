i lost a lot of time, almost threw the pc out the window......

And how exactly am i supposed to code "" ' "" ( single quote) to get it correctly back in the content? "

,totonebadass,2010-08-04T20:59Z,"ok, my mistake on single quote"
,totonebadass,2010-08-04T21:03Z,"In the PS part of the torrent description by re-upload i mean re-upload to the site from which you get info(the poi site), not necessarily torrent."
,totonebadass,2010-08-04T22:43Z,"OOps, one big boo-boo(must be the beer).

I forgot to say : This torrent contains  actually only speedcams for garmin.

For iGO, TomTom, Mio, etc, you need to go to the site (http://www.poiplaza.com) and get what you want for the device u want. ( you can even upload u'r own torrent fo u'r own type of device - I can't do it all :) ).

I feel i didn't make that clear enough ( or at all? ) in the description.

If u wanna call me names it's understandable.

All i meant to do is just try to get as many people to read this so as many people as possible go to poi sites and contribute.

+ I don't think it's to hard to get what you want from the free poi sites."

,totonebadass,2010-08-04T23:12Z,I mean i'm pretty ( 100% ) sure i didn't .... Sry again ... just go to site...
,totonebadass,2010-08-04T23:17Z,In case you didn't get it already i'm drinkin beer and watching the peers that are connecting to me ... :(
