None of these are safe."

,king03jeff,2010-08-10T14:03Z,"to those who have Windows 7 64-bit and after every reboot experiences the ""to enable offline play, connect to battle.net to authorize your game client"" error,

do the following, this is how it worked for me:

1. uninstall starcraft2 completely
2. reboot
3. after rebooting, run starcraft2 installer
4. click install
5. change the default install location (installed mine on another partition)
6. update online
7. run the razor1911 crack (sc2_copy and keytro)
8. run starcraft2 to see if it worked
9. reboot, then run starcraft2 again to see if the error still appears.



i installed starcraft2 on Windows 7 32-bit without having any errors.
but when i tested it on Windows 7 64-bit and after installing the razor1911 crack, after every reboot i experience this ""offline play authorization required"" error.

after doing the steps mentioned above, the error does not appear anymore.

hope this helps."

VirusTotal - 25/41 (61%) Link: is[.]gd/eBiQu
Jotti.org - 7/19 (37%) Link: is[.]gd/eBjaL

Comments:
Many positives from different scanners.
Only uploaded from anonymous users.
All sources I've downloaded match MD5.
Verdict: Probably safe, legit RZR keytro.
(Perhaps RZR just doesn't give shits about antivirus.)"
,Marco-man,2010-09-05T14:01Z,"Nothings  works :(

I tride  olmost evrything,but it stil dosent wanna work,the game starts,but i need to register :("
,Damien74,2010-09-26T20:13Z,PossiAtti and all the rest. Keygens are almost always detected as malware but in almost every case its wrong. If the uploader is VIP or something with a skull its most likely safe. No need to spam.
,miketuck61,2010-10-14T02:46Z,"So i've downloaded the game, it works and runs fine, i've downloaded the crack, but when i run the crack after updating the game i don't know where to save it to get it to work? help please"
,addyping,2011-03-04T17:07Z,"miketuck61: crack goes right in your @$$
use a mirror and see. :P"
,FuRrY321,2011-07-05T05:54Z,"Most keygens/cracks show up as malicious software (or potentially malicious software, in my case - using Avast! Free Antivirus). Besides, you're downloading from the freakin' Pirate Bay here! All torrents I've downloaded from here have never contained a virus, no matter what my AV tells me.

Now that that's out of the way...
Almost everything I've tried: no cracks - aka ""pure"" installation; hprodigy and king03jeff's suggestions; and just the RELOADED crack (update.bat would give some error, no matter where I placed it in the installation directory, and I didn't forget to copy over Blizzard Updater.exe). I'm currently attempting king03jeff's ""UPDATE!!!"" to the 1.0.3 patch; however, it's now at 1.3.4. A little out of date, there, but hopefully it works.

PS: Obviously trying to log in via guest account, and single player campaign, not multiplayer or skirmish for now."
,FuRrY321,2011-07-05T05:56Z,"OK, so no luck with anything I've tried. Online or offline install, online update or with the RELOADED crack, with the RELOADED crack by itself or with the Razor crack (or vice versa)... halp?

(Online update: latest patch is 1.3.4)"
,SatansBch,2011-10-06T13:13Z,"Can someone tell whether i can change my race with this crack?
I can only play as Terran and it is only a SC2 starter edition.
Is there a way to change this?"
