Any other people willing to seed?"
,Chazzk,2010-11-30T05:50Z,"Um... Is anyone else having problems with this video? I've got all the latest codecs, I think, but it always seems to be completely gray with only some moving parts visible, and after a few seconds crashes the player, no matter which player it is?"
