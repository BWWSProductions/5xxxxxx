MANILA - For the first time Comedy Concert King Martin Nievera and Mr. Pure Energy Gary Valenciano will be having a concert together dubbed as "As One" this coming September 19 at SM Mall of Asia Open Grounds.

"Very first time. We worked in other shows, projects but never a show or concert or a CD na kaming dalawa lang," Nievera told ABS-CBN News.

Valenciano said that their upcoming concert will be a proof that they are not rivals and they could work together as one.

"Kasi I think forever until the time that we are no long around, there will always be that comparison between Martin and Gary. There will always be that me looking over my shadow to see what Martin is doing and Martin doing the same thing. But for one concert event something that we do, that we really have a passion for and we are passionate about we came together as one," Valenciano said, adding:

"We are not talking about concert. We are talking about an event that could, maybe we are spearheading an event that could take place in the future of people coming together as one.  Kasi kakaiba talaga kapag nangyayari 'yon that people come together na sasabihin ng tao na 'wow is this people coming  together' and it makes everybody look good na  paang 'mayroon din pala sa kanila 'yong ability to come together like one."

Aside from their upcoming concert, Nievera and Valenciano are also busy recording their first album together titled "As One."

According to Martin, he and Gary have always wanted to put their songs together and with their first album he will be singing the songs of Gary and Gary will be singing his songs.

"You know there are lot of people who would collect or buy copies of CDs that number of songs would be Martin and number of songs would be mine. Now, they can do the same thing but it's Martin doing Gary V songs and Gary V doing Martin songs but not songs are all like that since there are two duets that are originals and then two songs each na 'yong amin talaga," Valenciano added.

 Martin said that the whole point of doing the album and the concert together is to show the people that everything is possible and that everybody can live as one.

"The whole point the concert and the CD for the first time what's used to be a competition will now become a team. And we want people all over the world not only in the Philippines to know, maybe this time, that we could live by exaple, that we can live as one, as one voice," Nievera said.


"As One" album is set to be released  first week of August.
