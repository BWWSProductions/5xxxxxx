,download-man,2010-08-02T09:44Z,"Video quality is not the best, probably only 5/10, But the audio is good. I would recommend though you wait for the HD rip to come out. It would be worth the wait for a better version :P "

[V],albiondean,2010-08-04T00:16Z,"I don't know why i upload my stuff on here, because i try and do people a favour and upload a tv show that they can't get in there own country, and there's always one or 2 pricks have to spoil it for others."
