[T],Jonzee,2010-09-04T12:40Z,"I like sharing the old films also, I'm using the program ""Handbrake"" to rip my DVD collection to H264, .mp4 . It seems to work ok, still experimenting to re-encode some of my DVDs. The ""television"" setting in the program is useful on some of the lower quality disks. Thanks for the film."
