,crowjik,2012-03-21T18:44Z,"I followed the instructions posted here, but when I run the patch it says ""Can not access the file. Maybe it's in use... Please close the file before patching!""
I have not run the file once. I tried patching directly after install, then tried restarting and patching, but the same message came up both times. 
Any help?"
