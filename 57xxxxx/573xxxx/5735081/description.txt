This is Dennis James Woods's amazing book Unlocking the Door - A Key to Biblical Prophecy (1994) which re-examines the biblical scriptures on which most eschatology is based and reveals how most conventional interpretations leave Christians unprepared for the prophetic events to come. The Bible teaches that in latter days there will be a mass defection from the faith. There are signs already around us that this defection may have begun. Will modern-day Christians remain faithful under severe persecution as have past generations of church saints? As we search for solutions to the problems that concern us all - escalating crime, economic instability, and political unrest - many are drawn to the answers offered by secular humanism. Are we being lulled into a sense of false hope that man, not God, can save the world? 200 pages. A must read for everyone.
