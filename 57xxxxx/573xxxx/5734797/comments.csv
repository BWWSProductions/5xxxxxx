,rickigo,2010-08-17T15:46Z,Thanks for this Murlok. First key I tried worked. Made a backup then a boot disc from program then restored system with boot disc and everything went good. Running Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit. Used installer from Acronis web site and key from this torrent. Used firewall to block internet from program. Confirmed WORKING.
