IMAGiNE NOTES
Sources used......video was vobs off ELEKTRI4KA and line audio off prism....many thanks both :)

Right work done.....firstly took the vobs we had and made a script to crop it, resize, white balance, brightness and contrast.
Then dropped that into vdub and used some more filters ...inc rgb eq, smoother, sharpen, hue, intes and a few more.
Now the audio is taken off prisms TS release so full credit for audio and syncing goes to them ;-)

UPLOADER NOTES
IN MY VERY HUMBLE OPINION...IF YOU ALREADY HAVE PrisM THEN YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED THIS ONE...ABOUT THE SAME...AT LEAST EXACT SAME AUDIO...I GUESS IT'S A MATTER OF PREFERENCE OF RELEASE GROUPS...PLEASE COMMENT :)
