I had the same issue as the other user however I installed the DirectX packadge that is included which allowed me to make it into the first mission.... but after like 30 seconds there is some error posted and then it asks us to send an error report and then it crashes - it doesnt give enough time to read the reason but I think it said somthing about a profile. anyways Please, please, please help us I really want to play this :)
