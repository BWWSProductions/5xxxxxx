Round Midnight
Eugen Cicero Trio - Live at the Subway in KÃ¶ln, 1997


Eugen Cicero was a jazz pianist of Romanian-Hungarian descent, who became world famous for his jazz interpretations and arrangements of baroque, classical and romantic works. Even his interpretations of jazz standards were always spiced with quotations from classical works. He is praised for his unparalleled virtuosity, his brilliant keystroke and outstanding creativity. 

In 1976 Eugen Cicero was awarded a German Schallplatten Preis for his arrangements of compositions by Franz Schubert. In addition to more than 70 recordings and numerous domestic and foreign TV appearances, he made pioneering recordings with the Berlin and Munich Philharmonic orchestras. He also toured Japan, a country where he achieved cult status thanks to his thousands of dedicated and loyal fans.

It was not easy for critics to categorize Eugen Cicero's playing. The designation 'golden hands', which was attributed to him throughout his career, was an indication that both music lovers and critics valued his consistently high level of performance, especially at times of radical change in the music scene. Even now, the name of Eugen Cicero stands for amazing musical virtuosity, phenomenal rhythmic feeling and an inexhaustibly inventive genius.
