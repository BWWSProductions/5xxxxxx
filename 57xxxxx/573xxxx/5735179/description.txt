The film starts when L'armata Brancaleone ends. Brancaleone da Norcia (again played by Vittorio Gassman) is a poor but prideful Middle Ages knight leading his bizarre army of underdogs. However, he loses in a battle all his "warriors" and therefore meets the Death's incarnation (a clear parody of Bergman's Seventh Seal). Having obtained more time to live, he form a new tattered band.
When Brancaleone saves a new-born child, they set on to the Holy Sepulchre to bring him back to his father, Bohemund of Taranto, which is fighting in the Crusades. As in the first film, in his quest he lives a series of grotesque episodes, each a hilarious parody of Middle Ages stereotypes.
