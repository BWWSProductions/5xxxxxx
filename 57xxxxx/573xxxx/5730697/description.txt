The Cribs was the title of The Cribs' debut album released in 2004. It was recorded in 7 days in mid/late 2003 at London's Toe-Rag Studios, a vintage styled 8 track studio in the Hackney area. It was self produced by the band with Ed Deegan engineering, all except track 9, "Tri'elle", which was culled from the band's original sessions at Fortress Studio with Chicago based Avant-Garde musician Bobby Conn. In 2005, this record was awarded the prestigious American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) College Award. Previous winners have included Coldplay and Franz Ferdinand.
