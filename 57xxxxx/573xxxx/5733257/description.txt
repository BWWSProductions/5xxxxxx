Comments: If you've ever gone to the delightful Ninja Restaurant in New York, then you've likely heard and enjoyed the wonderful, fast fingering style of Hiroshi Takasaki. The artist provides the wonderful ambiance for the ninja themed restaurant.

Haruka is a more traditional Japanese world album; fans of world music will likely be impressed by his impressive style. On the whole, the music is what you'd expect Japanese world music to sound like; traditional instruments, traditional sound. 

Beyond Eternal takes the traditional Japanese theme and mixes in some more pop elements; tracks feel more backed up by other instruments and have a different but equally enjoyable energy. 

Two albums, two different styles, one great artist.
