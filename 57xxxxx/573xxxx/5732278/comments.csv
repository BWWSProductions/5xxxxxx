It is an absolute life saver for everyone of us that can't watch the BBC and their awesome coverage by any other means!
I really appreciate how you upload the forum aswell. It is just a professional coverage through and through.
Thank you! "

Just in case of another IT messup I just wanted to say many, many sincere thanks to tdmk1! You are a hero!"
