Summary:

     A documentary series on life in and adapted to the conditions of the Southern part of the Pacific Ocean, a vast aquatic region with an unequaled number of islands. Both wildlife and human cultures developed in a unique variety, largely determined by such natural conditions as huge distances, sea depths, currents and winds.

Season 1

Episode 1: Ocean of Islands
Original Air Date 10 May 2009

The South Sea, or southern Pacific Ocean, from Galapagos to Antarctic, comprises a quart of the world's water. Yet is's barely known, being so vast and scarcely populated with humans, yet immensely with wildlife, largely in seasonal migrations, as with breeding birds etc. and their predators. In reality, the weather and currents are varied, not just tropical heat, and crucial, as even storms were for propagating species, which may then mutate, often bizarrely, resulting in extraordinary variety on over 20,000, often quite isolated islands. Man too evolved uniquely, most within a mere two milennia, resulting in the strangest cultural traditions. Easter Island testifies to their ecological fragility.


Episode 2: Castaways
Original Air Date 17 May 2009

The propagation of species and people over the fast southern Pacific combined with evolution to create its diversity. It was largely operated by natural forces, such as currents and storms, but in the few milennia since men moved in by boats from present Indonesia also deliberately and/or accidentally trough human travels.


Episode 3: Endless Blue
Original Air Date 24 May 2009

Due to its extreme size and depth, the South Pacific has an equivalent variety of marine life. Some species are unique and most adapted to the various requirements of its conditions, such as great distances to travel in seasonal migrations, as whales, sharks and even turtles do.


Episode 4: Ocean of Volcanoes
Original Air Date 31 May 2009

Many if the countless island in the South Pacific are neither broken off continental shells nor made by corals, but created by spectacular volcanic activity in the ocean. These often young, fertile grounds developed varied wildlife on and around them.


Episode 5: Strange Islands
Original Air Date 7 June 2009

Wildlife on the isolated South Sea islands largely evolved separately, creating unique, often bizarre species. However exposure to immigrant species, especially since the arrival of humans, can wipe and increasingly does them out, even completely. Human over-exploitation and competition with domesticated species, like pigs, can be as detrimental to the ecosystem. Easter Island's Rapa Nui culture proves how quickly a fragile paradise can become a wasteland.


Episode 6: Fragile Paradise
Original Air Date 14 June 2009

Almost all of the great and largely unique variety of South Pacific wildlife is under threat from excessive and destructive fishing, hunting, harvesting and pollution. Worst of all are ecological threats, notably global warming, which causes rising sea levels as well as climatic changes including storms and floods. Conservation measures, such as reserves and replanting coral reefs, can make a difference.
