Brilliant soul from the Detroit underground of the late 60s -- a full set of work by vocalist Little Ann, issued here for the first time ever! You might recognize Ann's name from her appearance on a few of the Ace/Kent Records issues of material by Detroit producer Dave Hamilton over the years -- and the work here all comes from those classic collaborations with Hamilton -- trapped on tape for many years, always contemplated as a possible Little Ann album
