Please Note
Sometimes lately a special character as basic as an apostrophe is enough to cause PirateBay to chop off all the rest of a torrent description that follows.  If it appears that part of the description is missing, you can always find it in the show info text file included with each torrent.

Alex spent a fair amount of time talking about an article by Jonah Lehrer in one of Wired.com's science blogs, The Frontal Cortex.
The article, titled "The Brain Eating Vaccine Conspiracy," is a response to the brain-eating-virus meme that Alex launched yesterday.
Expect Alex to really attack Lehrer tomorrow. I recommend that you read his article before listening to tomorrow's Jones show, or if possible, before listening to today's show.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:
sebaygo1_torrents_info_PLEASE-READ.txt

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
