"Ron Quits"

When Ron starts spending too much time with his 
girlfriend, the boys get upset and Ron decides 
to quit. The boys then hire their bully 
neighbor, Barry (Justin Berfield), as their new 
live-in caretaker. But when the boys discover 
they're out of money and realize that Barry 
isn't working out, they come to the conclusion 
that Ron was a better fake father than they 
thought.

Enjoy :)
