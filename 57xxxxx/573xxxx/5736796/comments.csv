,luke208,2010-12-05T01:16Z,"Noob comment, I installed everything like normal, launched CS5, but can't seem to find where the plugins are.  New filters and what not.  BTW, I wasn't able to copy/paste/replace the Viveza plugin.

If you canât find the plug-ins after you've installed them, go to the File > Automate menu or go to Window > Extensions > onOne. Thatâs where the plug-ins all live."
