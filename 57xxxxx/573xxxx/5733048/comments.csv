,titanium007,2010-08-05T17:12Z,"something's wrong with -ALL- IMMERSE torrents since last week - they won't play anymore on PS3 via PS3MediaServer. 

NON WORKING shows (not a complete list):

- True Blood S03E07 (all episodes up to this one worked fine)
- Mad Men S04E02 (E01 worked fine)
- Hung S02E05 (all episodes up to this one worked fine)
- Covert Affairs S01E04 (all episodes up to this one worked fine) 
- Entourage S07E05 (all episodes up to this one worked fine)"
,titanium007,2010-08-05T17:20Z,"hi - is there any way to email TvTeam - ALL of their Immerse releases (720p) of TV Shows uploaded after 1st August 2010 DO NOT WORK if streamed on PS3 via PS3 Media Server. 
Something must've changed in .mkv encoding and I'd like to bring it to their attention.

thanks"
