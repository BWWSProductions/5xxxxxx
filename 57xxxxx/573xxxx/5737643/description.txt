           Summer vacation in Mountain's Edge, a sprawling                
           two-square-mile subdivision of three-story                     
           half-million-dollar catalogue homes in suburban Denver.        
           At the heart of the subdivision, its own fleet of soccer       
           fields, manicured and gleaming - a game in play, a swarm       
           of 12-year-olds running from end to end, moms and dads in      
           that "off-duty Hollywood" look. At the foot of the             
           subdivision: The desert to one side, long and dry, and         
           endless-looking. To the other side, a span of high-desert      
           foothills, rolling upward into the greener, higher             
           mountains. It is here that two sets of kids - neighbors        
           in both landscape and loss - will wake one morning to          
           find that their paths begin to resemble that of a              
           character in their favorite mythological book series.          
           What they don't yet know is that an invisible darkness         
           following them is what they make it out to be -                
           themselves, their fears about their parents, the               
           frequency of change in their lives, and the instability        
           of a world lived on the mountain's edge.
