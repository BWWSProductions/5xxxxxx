,mkluv,2010-08-20T05:13Z,can someone upload a 720p dvd5 size version? why do you need DD + DTS? it's the same audio. waste of bandwidth.
,Elgabro,2011-08-02T19:44Z,"@mkluv no its not the same DTS is better, but i agree with why both, cuz if DTS is a bit better....why have something thats worse ^^

Now lets see if this movie is crap like everyone says"
