This has some modifications for my personal needs:

1. Busybox + ROOT 
2. Old A2SD+ (Cause the Froyo one sucks.), if you don't want to use this, don't create an ext partition on your sdcard. Simple as that.
3. OpenVPN binary with tun modules for the new kernel (loaded on boot)
4. EXT4 support (also through a module on boot) - EXT2 and EXT3 are still supported, don't worry.
5. Wifi 802.11N support.
6. Symlinked /data/local/bootanimation.zip for easy bootanimation replacements.

You will also need the new radio for this:
