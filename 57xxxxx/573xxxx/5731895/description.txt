> MAME is an emulator application designed to recreate the hardware of arcade
  game systems in software, with the intent of preserving gaming history and
  preventing vintage games from being lost or forgotten. The aim of MAME is to
  be a reference to the inner workings of the emulated arcade machines; the
  ability to actually play the games is considered "a nice side effect". The
  name is an acronym for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator.

  This is the complete MAME Rom Collection. it is packed using zip and then rar.
  and includes the MAMEUI for v64 and x86.
