,masterfaster2,2010-09-05T12:49Z,It doesn't have the CHDs that's why you have missing files. It may also not include the samples.
,GarudaBKK,2010-09-19T10:04Z,How about the Bios Roms? And does this torrent include Neo Geo Games and the Bios necessary for those? I have found this to be trickier than expected to run those on MAME and NeoRageX and Kawaks dun work well for me(no windows 7 64-bit arcadestick support so far so they are useless at this point) and I rather stick to MAME anyway. Thanks for the upload and info.
,GarudaBKK,2010-09-20T17:11Z,"Update to my last comment: This torrent contains all necessary BIOS versions and Neo Geo Roms. Absolutely perfect collection and everything runs. Very, very few won't start cuz of missing CHDs(where can they be found?). THANX a lot!"
