A Swedish movie (which no one will ever see anywhere else on this planet) - with Swedish subtitles!?!?!?! Come on, guys! Why not rip it with ENGLISH subs, so that the rest of the world can watch this as well? There are more fans of Izabella Scorupco out there than you might think! You would have 100 seeders instead of 5. Think about that. :-("
