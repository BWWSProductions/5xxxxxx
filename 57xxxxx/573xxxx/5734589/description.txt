The acclaimed debute feature of Yoichi Sai, Jukkai no mosquito was produced by the Art Theatre Guild (ATG) in 1983. The film explores the story of a policeman who lives a poor but honest life. His ex-wife and daughter constantly badger him for more money, but nothing else. As he lives alone the policeman buys a personal computer that he can ill-afford, in an effort to make some kind of human interaction.

Jukkai no Mosukito is the tragic story of a policeman who has never succeeded in anything in life and seems to be hopelessly bound to failure in all his undertakings.He lives in small room on the tenth floor of an apartment building, an aerial sanctuary where he seeks refuge. He spends all his spare time there, drinking cheap sake, playing computer games or making love with Keiko, a girl he has met in a bar. He is broke and depressed. Chased by loan-sharks, in a fit of despair he commits an armed robbery in a post office√¢
