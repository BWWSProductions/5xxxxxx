Storyline:

Five years after he was murdered by his own colleagues in a covert government operation, Al Simmons makes a pact with the devil to be resurrected so
that he may see his wife Wanda once more.
In return for the favor, the devil requires, in typically Faustian fashion, that Simmons lead Hell's Army for the destruction of humankind.
Blessed in life with extraordinary killing skills, Simmons is even more deadly with the backing of his new master and the changling powers he has at his disposal.
As he begins to discover and exercise his new strengths, he encounters two figures who direct him to use his powers in order to serve two different agendas.
Cogliostro encourages Spawn to fight the devil and become a new champion for humankind, while Clown goads Spawn into continuing to serve his new master
and lead the Armageddon.
