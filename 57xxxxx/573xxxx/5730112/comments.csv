,brorjace,2010-08-01T05:42Z,"Thanks, downloading now.

Has anyone used this and used RealID? Does it let you log into your RealID (I would assume no, and it's not safe but it's worth asking I think :))"
,Obama_bin_Laden,2010-08-01T05:53Z,"Oh thank God Razor1911 comes to the rescue LOLZ day late, dollar short. "
,scrdppy,2010-08-01T06:43Z,"note that this iso and the reloaded iso are the same with respect the starcraft contents; so if you have the reloaded iso, you can install from there, and then you can use or get the razor1911 crack-only, you don't have to get the whole iso just for the crack. Tested this with md5 sum.

so in conclusion, what razor1911 iso has more is these:
874595258cf21c14cb0f9a64d7cd6cc9 *E:\autorun.inf
697a1b02e2f8f6469c0274eb1a9decd0 *E:\disc.ico
5f2123ac064a6c22e234c89b3d1e6f0f *E:\Razor1911\Keytro.exe
200bcf00d8c3e7f42b1fd87050a203a9 *E:\Razor1911\sc2_copy.dat
04834039d8887261611dac81079c1353 *E:\Razor1911\sc2_copy.exe

which is the crack and two irrelevant files.

Do your mounting with magicdisc (it's from magiciso) which is freeware and works on 64bit systems, 'cause I've heard daemon tools doesn't moun"

,hprodigy,2010-08-06T12:27Z,"This is only WORKING multiplayer (AI,skirmish) crack....

1) Unrar, burn or mount ISO

,tirgger,2010-08-06T20:38Z,I can't find the iso can someone plz help 
,MonkeyPwns,2010-08-07T05:14Z,"tirgger, change the extension of 001 to .rar then extract the file to wherever you want, when prompted tell the program to continue extracting from the next one (so rzr.scii.002, since you changed rzr.scii.001 to rzr.scii.rar). I am doing that right now so I'll re-post to let you know how it goes."
,MonkeyPwns,2010-08-07T05:36Z,"scratch that, dont bother changing the extension. double click on the 001 file and when it prompts you, select winrar as the program to open it"
,tirgger,2010-08-07T18:14Z,thank for the help
,dlbrody69,2010-08-10T10:01Z,Ver 1.0.2 seems to be causing issues with the crack...have tried everything...for many hours..cannot get it to work.
,king03jeff,2010-08-10T14:11Z,"after every reboot, if you experience the ""to enable offline play, connect to battle.net to authorize your game client"" error,

do the following, this is how it worked for me:

1. uninstall starcraft2 completely
2. reboot
3. after rebooting, run starcraft2 installer
4. click install
5. change the default install location (installed mine on another partition)
6. update online
7. run the razor1911 crack (sc2_copy and keytro)
8. run starcraft2 to see if it worked
9. reboot, then run starcraft2 again to see if the error still appears.



after doing the steps mentioned above, the error does not appear anymore.

hope this helps."
