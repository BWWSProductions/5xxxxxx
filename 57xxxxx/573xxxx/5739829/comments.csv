,brothabill,2010-08-24T01:27Z,"yeah, this doesnt work, dont waste your time, comes with ERROR OPENING AL FRAMEWORK
MAKE SURE THAT IS IN YOUR DIRECTORY 

or some shit to that effect, dont waste your time with this torrent, obviously thenoobish is a noob"
,brothabill,2010-08-24T01:38Z,"Just joking, all you have to do is open the .dmg file and click on the lord of the rings phrase, it will prompt you to enter in the serial txt and then it installs
easy peezy japanese"
,dingoen,2010-08-25T19:25Z,how do i install this when the registration number box pops up?
,dingoen,2010-08-25T19:29Z,waht should i enter in the registration number box?
,dingoen,2010-08-28T21:29Z,"i figured it out, but as soon as you have downloaded the game your going to have to use toast to burn a dvd to play the game because there isnt a no CD crack as far as i can see."
,piratenic1994,2010-09-10T21:11Z,"The installation works fine by me, but when I try to open the game it says:

---------------------------------------------------------
""You need ""The Return Of The King"" DVD in your DVD-ROM drive to play this game""

please insert it and try again
---------------------------------------------------------

What do I have to do??
Please help!"
,Folkmar,2010-09-28T00:43Z,"The installation and starting the game works fine, but I seem to have some problems with the graphics. My Mac meets all the required specs., but still the graphic acts like it doesn't. Everything is striped and in incorrect colours. 

Does anyone have the same problem and maybe a solution for this? "
,rolerox,2010-10-08T00:11Z,"IT IS WORKING THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLATION ARE AS FOLLOWS:
1-download
2-mount dmg and click the installer it will request the serial code that is provided in a txt file,it is working! just write it manually 
3-then unzip the crack , drag the crack to  the installation directory (applications) 
4.- run the ""The Return Of The King [P]"" file 
5.- adjust the video settings you have to try the one wich fits best to your mac , high detail works fine
6.- ENJOY
P.D: IF ANYONE SHOULD HAVE A PROBLEM PM ME, AND PLEASE UPLOAD MORE MAC GAMES!!"
,Systole,2010-10-27T10:06Z,Is there any way to fix the the graphics problem where everything is stripes?
,spam0000,2010-11-08T21:18Z,"Im stopping to seed this because I want to spare people throwing their computer out the window in frustration over the most useless game ever. I am not the one who often comments on torrents, but this game was too much.

- The objectives are vague, and this makes you die all the time without knowing the reason.
- Your view is a set camera that follow you ""like in a movie"" with the result that you constantly miss out on where you want to see.
- Stuff (rocks, explosions, etc) gets in the way of the view all the time
- The characters blend with each other, and when in battle you loose track of where you are all the time
- even the graphics are bad and the cut scenens, which are mostly cut straight from the movie are in youtube quality
- on my macbook 2.6ghz dual core with 4gb ram this game (from 2003! 7 yrs old!!) is still not running smooth! in a battle graphichs can get really choppy!!
- and just to top it all off: you cant save, so all the shit you have to go through again and again
- and to top it even further: you cant skip the cutscenes....


Even if you are a LOTR fanatic, this game will only give you bad associations.

I feel lucky that I didnt smash my computer, I rose above the game and deleted it before I finished it (I never really do that), and I WILL NOT SEED! PLEASE follow and do NOT SEED! 

*sorry about the big rant, but I really mean this*"
,MmeM,2010-12-27T11:03Z,"@spam0000 

I respectfully disagree with you. 
- Objectives are vague if you don't concentrate. 
- The view following you like a camera makes it possible to include a co-op mode. There are so few co-op games (for mac) that I can only be glad about that. 
- Sometimes, rocks do get in the way, but I think that's makes the experience better too.
- The graphics are okay for a 7 year old game, and the cutscenes are partially taken from the movie (also some scenes that can't be seen in the original movie), but the quality is mostly youtube-like because they used non-filtered images (makes everything a bit crappy).
- The game runs smooth for me (same specs as you)
- I can save fine
- The cutscenes are indeed extremely annoying because you can't skip them (you can only skip them if you already saw them).

Overall, I think this is a great game. It has a lot of room for improvement, but the gameplay is still great. I recommend playing this with a friend in co-op mode though."
,roemerbakker,2011-01-12T07:35Z,"I know it!!!

-Simply open the installer ON THE DMG!!!!
-Type in the serial and an normal Mac installer opens.
-Just install
-Move the crack/keygen/whatever in your Applications>Return Of The King folder.
-Open it 
-A window pops up for the screen resolution click yours and play!"
,mea7sucks,2011-01-15T00:05Z,"Okay. Its not fucking difficult to figure out how to 1)Install this game and 2)Install the crack.

You need to install the game using the DMG that is not inside the folder labelled Crack. When you are asked for a serial open up the folder that is labelled crack and open up the SERIAL.txt file (omg magic wizardry)... When the game is installed open the second DMG labelled [P] and there you go. Its not fucking difficult. Need a video?"
,Benskie13,2011-02-08T06:08Z,I need some help. After installing it says I need to insert the disk to play. What do I burn to a disk with Toast.
,FluffyBeast,2011-03-10T14:32Z,"doesn't work for me, if i click iinstall, give in the serial code nothing happens, and with the crack too.."
,IanLimJX,2011-07-02T12:43Z,do i replace the app with the crack?
,tracey1912,2011-08-05T16:33Z,"i dragged the icon from dmg to desktop and had same problem, inserted serial and nothing happened. dont drag icon to desktop just double click it where it is then caps lock on type serial and it worked. drag crack icon into the folder created after install and click that to play. works fine on mac pro (early 2008)  osx 10.6.8"
,GRGiannisGR,2011-08-24T11:45Z,where can we find a serial ??
,wynsandyvino,2011-08-26T11:34Z,"Just take the serial.txt and write it !

I've done everything right but I have the same problem as some of you:

""You need ""The Return Of The King"" DVD in your DVD-ROM drive to play this game""

please insert it and try again""

can somebody help me with this, all other stept were done correctly..."
,Gaffel75,2011-11-05T16:36Z,it works fine (you have to put you're crack/keygen/... in the application->LOTR Return of the king map and it works) but when i start playing after a while it just shutsdown :s i had this with nfs to anyone know what the problem is?
,Lugalzzagezi,2011-11-22T11:56Z,"okayâŚ i did everything right, but when i try to run the return of the king [p] app pops a message that says: Error opening OpenAL Framework, Please make sure OpenAL.framework is in the installation directoryâŚ dont know what to do moved it from where it was, put it in applications, but anything works. What should i do??"
