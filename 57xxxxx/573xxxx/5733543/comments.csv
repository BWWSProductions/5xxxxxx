It relates to philosophy of government. Regardless of whether I find all of the ideas in it sound or agreeable it is not a piece of crap, is not stupid and calling it excreta is fairly immature. I recommend reading it to anyone interested in learning about Libya, NATO's bombing of it, politics in the middle-east, or political theory in general."
