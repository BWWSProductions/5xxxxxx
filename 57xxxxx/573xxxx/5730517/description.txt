Plot: The story of Hamlet, the Danish prince who has discovered that his uncle who in killed his father, claimed the kingdom of Denmark and married Hamlets mother Gertrude, has been captivating audiences for centuries.

Patrick Stewart's (X-Men, Star Trek: The Next Generation)  portrayal as Claudius has a presence that radiates confidence and a true understanding of the material with an emotional depth that seethes under the surface.

David Tennant (Doctor Who) is a different beast altogether in this role as the young Danish prince, brings a rush of frenetic energy and intensity perfectly suited to the character feigning madness.

His scattershot portrayal, reminiscent of his Doctor on Doctor Who, wears all the emotions on his sleeve.  The two play off each other for one of the more balanced performances of Hamlet in recent years.
