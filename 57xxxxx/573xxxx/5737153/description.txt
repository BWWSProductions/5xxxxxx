NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Salt

Right first off the source we used was the russian cam like everyone else and the same cam audio of the hogs
release,thanks to both 
Now the video was for a cam,but lacked some depth to it and also had a bad yellow tint to it.....the audio for cam 
was good,better than your normal cam stuff but still had faults.
Work done .....firstly we tweaked the video,changing the rgb colours to balance them out and look more natural,also lowered
the chroma,increased the brightness and contrast a touch,used a white balance filter along with a touch of sharpness.
Then it was a case of syncing the audio......took around 12 cuts.Oh also we filtered the audio to try and give it a touch more life.

Also we've tested this with convertx and it will convert to dvd without any oos issues 

On another note we have sweet line audio for this and cats and dogs 2......but both being a major pain in the ass to sync so if theres
any syncers that fancy helping us out feel free to message us on the addy further down.
But for now heres our cam version ......enjoy
