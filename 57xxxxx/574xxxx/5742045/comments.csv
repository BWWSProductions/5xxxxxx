I'm unclear on this, but either way I refuse to go to their website to check it out on principle.

A note to all the kids out there:  If an organization of any sort throws around the word ""scene"" like a white eminem fan throws around ""mad"" and ""hizzy"", then they are 1 of 3 things:

1) A script kiddie trying to impress everyone with their knowledge that RARing a compressed file will reduce the file size by a whopping 0.5%, and make it really inconvenient for everyone.  Also that they have looked up ""the scene"" on Wikipedia in their native language and have a fair comprehension of the article that they found.

2) A spam site with lots and lots of Flash ads that all inject malware into your stupid, stupid unprotected system.

3) A movie and/or film studio trying to get a good handle on how much of their intellectual property is being traded, and/or to prosecute the offenders, and/or to inject BS fake videos into ""the scene"".

Either way, you are poseurs, and worthless to the community.

Thank you for your time."
