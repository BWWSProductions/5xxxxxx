,wmoecke,2012-05-20T00:02Z,"Unfortunately there are more episodes. These 6 are only from the first season (2009). There are 4 more from the second season (2010) where they replaced Jurgen Heinemmann with Terry Sandin (from the series Prototype This).

I hoped you would have uploaded these as well, as I already got the first six.   :-/"
