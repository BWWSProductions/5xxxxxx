,sarahbellum,2010-09-11T05:44Z,Not getting any sound.
,Jona198102,2010-09-22T06:38Z,"There is sound.

I have no idea why I attract these types of comments with my torrents... 

I assure you, there is sound.

Try ffdshow or AC3Filter. Or play it with VLC (VideoLan)."
,moshster,2010-10-07T02:02Z,Just a shame it;s the 4:3 version and not the 16:9 ratio version that was released on LaserDisc.
,Big_Blue_Monkey,2010-11-12T20:32Z,"Like another poster i to am not getting any sound, i have both ffdshow and AC3 that work fine with other videos i have, also when you play it with VLC the sound is automatically disabled when you first play it and even when you manually select track 1 you still hear nothing. Im attempting to run it through pinnacle to see if i can get the audio from it."
,Tenkicks,2010-11-19T01:22Z,"There is no audio.

Fire it up on MPC, see the little speaker icon on the bottom right with an ""X"" next to it, that means there is no audio.

Remove from seeding"
,Jona198102,2010-11-19T22:44Z,"Sorry you 3 are having trouble, but I just ""fired"" it up on a fresh install of MPC Home Cinema, on a brand-new Windows 7 install, btw.

Perfect video AND audio.

The problem is with you, not with the torrent."
,Jona198102,2010-11-19T22:58Z,"I just checked: 31 seeders, 30ish peers. 3 months-old torrent... 3 people complain there's no audio..

Did you 3 ever stop to think the problem was with your setup?

If you want absolute proof there's sound, demux the thing with YAMB 2.0 and you'll see.

It'll break out into an XVID and an AC3 stream.

Unreal.."
,rabadaba,2010-12-03T08:36Z,"The sound doesn't work on the VLC player, but it works just fine on 'Zoom player'

Good quality-
Thanks Jona!"
,Jona198102,2010-12-06T10:24Z,"Its working on all players for me, including Videolan. Using 1.1.4

Its an AC3 stream, which is the original audio format.

Who knows...

Maybe I shouldn't have muxed it into an MP4. It was done with the latest version of MeGUI (muxing part).

You could always demux and wrap in a different container."
,skinfever,2011-01-15T03:53Z,NO SOUND ! It's a fact. Running Brand new win 7 HP Envy with the kLite pack ......HorseShit
,skatanafate,2011-02-07T19:25Z,"Agreed with the one that mentioned the ratio of seeders/leechers - if it was a dud without sound it wouldn't have many peers. It downloaded with maximum speed, and it plays fine with Total Video Player. Good picture quality, and it indeed HAS good sound.

It's a bit inconvenient that I got no sound with most media players, including my favourite Media Player Classic.

I hope it works on PS3 without a conversion..."
,Dappleblood,2011-02-19T14:04Z,"TROLL

Sound? Maybe you muted your brains dumbos...

That's an easy problem to solve noobs..."
,spmt2,2011-06-23T23:09Z,@Jona198102 why the hell do u upload a torrent with such problems?........half of the world is complaining dude.
