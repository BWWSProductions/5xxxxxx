,K1L0GR4m,2010-08-09T05:33Z,"Originals are in VHS. There is no dvd version as some material been reclassified and the series are not sold anymore. You can use a dvd converter to burn them on dvd if you wish, the quality is very good for a vhs rip."
,Witchypoo1,2010-08-14T17:54Z,rambam1776 ...use convertxtodvd.  I find I can get about 6 hours of video per dvd without it impairing the quality.   http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5577554/ConvertXtoDVD_v4.0.12.327___Serials_%5BChattChitto_RG%5D
