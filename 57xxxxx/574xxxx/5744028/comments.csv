,molama,2010-08-07T22:29Z,"DON`T DOWNLOAD

this is pure shit trust me!"
,krumbak,2010-08-10T20:55Z,The audio is Chinese or something. The movie however is real 3D.
,DoctorVrach,2010-08-11T18:46Z,10% in one day. Â∞èomplete disappointment!
,AgentHitman,2010-08-17T00:44Z,Yes it's disappointment because many of seeders limits the upload!
,AgentHitman,2010-08-21T22:39Z,"Fuck this shit!Thx uploader!""Need to watch 3D device: the simplest is the red and blue glasses""      BULLSHIT!!!"
,L4m4,2010-08-22T21:56Z,Awsome with Nvidia 3D! Best 3D content I have ever yet. But the audio is in some asian language. Does anyone know what it takes to change the sound in a MKV file?
,krumbak,2010-08-25T11:11Z,You could remux the video with an english dts track. But since this movie is 30fps you have to find an english dts trrack from a 30fps movie and not 24fps i guess
,bartdotnet,2010-09-06T07:10Z,"Here are the programs needed:

MKVmerge
Stereoscopic Player
ffdshow
MKVextract / VirtualDub (Optional)

1.) First off, do you already have a copy of Avatar?
If so, you can demux the audio from it and save some bandwidth.
The DTS English track posted above is from the Blu-ray with a runtime of 2:41:41.
If you use a track from a PAL source you'll have to adjust the timings.

Use MKVextract or VirtualDub to demux the audio.
MKVextract (.mkv) (resave your .avi with MKVmerge)
VirtualDub (.avi/mkv)

2.) Now that you have all your files, open MKVmerge.
- Drag in order the .mkv file, then the .dts file and finally the .srt file into the top window.
- Uncheck the AC3 Mandarin track.
- Select the DTS English DTS track and set language to English and default track to Yes.
with the English track still selected tab over to Format specific options. Put -950 into the delay window.
- Select the AVC video track and tab over to Format specific options. Put 23.999/23.976 into the stretch window.
- Select the English srt file and set language to English and default track to Yes.
- Change the output file name to Avatar.2009.3D.Stereoscopic.CAM.720p.AVC.DTS-YZX.mkv and click start muxing.

3.) Install Stereoscopic Player and follow this guide to enable subtitles.

4.) Open Stereoscopic Player and drag in Avatar. Set your layout as Over/Under, Left Image Top.
Under View, select your viewing method. These are my recommended setting for anaglyph.
- Red / Cyan (Optimized Anaglyph)
- Yellow / Blue (Color Anaglyph)
- Green / Magenta (Half Color Angalyph)

Enjoy

Hardcoded asian subs on the Na'vi parts
Asian audio"
,stinger666,2010-11-05T05:25Z,Can you watch it via HDMI on 3DTV?
,Aimar55555,2010-12-23T17:20Z,"When you use vlc-mediaplayer on a MKV file (like this on) it will be easy to switch to English audio by simpelly clicking on the audio-tab and selecting the audio-track (if english is included). You could also try with other players, what you have to keep in mind is that MKV-files some times are multi-language.(languages are internal)

When english is not included you will have to rip the video and copy past audio-shit into the file, what I think is just too much effort.

I'm kinda wondering if this works with the red/blue-glasses. It would be nice if the seeders could answer my question.

I'm just a kid from the Netherlands thence the bad English."
,i4gotmy_sn,2011-02-11T23:04Z,"@Aimar55555

If and when I finish DL'ing this, I'll let you know. All I have the option for right now is stereoscopic. Hopefully, all that it requires are the red/cyan glasses, b/c I'm not about to spend $100-$150 per pair for the shutter, battery-powered kind.

,VishnuNJ,2011-04-11T17:00Z,"Its works perfectly with any of the 3d glasses available, except for glasses you get from movie theater.. (if u have a 3D projector u can use that glass too)

Pirate search ""stereoscopic player"" for this purpose.. 
See options in the player if u have any doubt... "
