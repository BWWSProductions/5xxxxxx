,charly_corr,2012-03-24T21:07Z,"Thanks. Works fine but i have problems with the videos: the sound cuts a lot. I have CFW 5.50 GEN-D3 with a 4GB Produo ScanDisk on PSP FAT. I repeat, the gameplay is fine, only the sound on the videos, the title screen and the settings screen is when sound cuts. In fact when I put the game takes too long to load (like 27 seconds) I wonder what be the problem? i hope someone can help me. Greetings"
