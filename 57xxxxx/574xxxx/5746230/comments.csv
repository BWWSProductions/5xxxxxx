,xzink,2011-05-07T17:39Z,"How to install this?

 Copy your content (maps, poi, 3D, elevations) to your SD Card's iGO\Content directory (not iGO My Way\Content)

Where is this iGO folder? The only folder I can see is iGO My Way"
,MrChompy,2011-05-18T00:09Z,"""3. Copy your content (maps, poi, 3D, elevations) to your SD Card's iGO\Content directory (not iGO My Way\Content)""

You might have to physically create this folder before dumping your the content folders into it

Works well on HTC hero
