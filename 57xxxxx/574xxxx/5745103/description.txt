"Prove Your Love" is a song recorded by dance-pop vocalist Taylor Dayne, released as the second single from her debut album in 1988. Like her previous single "Tell It to My Heart", it is a high energy dance track with aggressive vocal delivery.

The song's music video shows Dayne riding in her man's car around New York City.

"Prove Your Love" was Dayne's second U.S. Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the spring of 1988, where it peaked at #7. The song spent eleven weeks in the Top 40. It also appeared on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart, where it became Dayne's first #1 hit on that chart on April 23, 1988. Furthermore, the song was a hit overseas, going to #1 in Switzerland, #4 in Germany and #8 on the UK singles chart.

Tell It to My Heart is the debut album by singer-songwriter Taylor Dayne. The LP yielded four top ten singles. "Tell It to My Heart" (peaked at #7), "Prove Your Love" (also peaked at #7), "I'll Always Love You" (which climbed to #3) and "Don't Rush Me" (obtaining the highest charting position of the four at #2). This album went 2x platinum in the United States.

Two covers were used for the album: the original was very colorful and had Dayne resemble her appearance in the "Tell it to My Heart" music video with big hair and a tight black dress. The subsequent cover was more subdued and had Dayne with much less makeup and hair, sitting against a wall in a brown leather jacket and white t-shirt.
