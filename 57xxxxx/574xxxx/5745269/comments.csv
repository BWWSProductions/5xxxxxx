can u pls upload tis movie soon....."
,chatboysam,2010-12-20T21:24Z,"Have been enjoying your torrents for long. I just read that you are working on 1000 places to visit before you die and Friends. I have been waiting for them for so much time. Please do it soon.
BTW, I have got some links on 1000 places to die in 350 MB and some are even available on Youtube. If you want I can give it to you and it will make the job easier. But still left with 2-3 files in 1080p that needs to be brought down to 350 MB. 
Please tell me an estimation time when you're gonna be uploading either of these.
Thanks a lot for all your uploads. You're the best uploader ever and because of you I've been able to save at least 30-40 Gb space in my HDD."
,chatboysam,2010-12-20T21:26Z,Sorry 1000 places to see*
