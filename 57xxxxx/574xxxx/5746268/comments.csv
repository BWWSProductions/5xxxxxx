,ash_96bc,2010-08-11T05:21Z,Not to be a wet blanket (and I'm no expert) but the added scenes seem glitchy and fuzzy to me. Anyone else?
,IAmTheMilkman,2012-05-23T04:05Z,"This is a fan edit, and a poor one at that. I would NOT download this, if I were you. All of the scenes that were added back in have no IVTC applied which makes them incredibly jerky and almost un-watchable, plus the audio isn't great on them. AND, worst of all, the Tony Stark cameo at the end has been cut! That pissed me off to no end. Fuck this edit."
