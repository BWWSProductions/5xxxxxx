PUBLISHER\'S DESCRIPTION:
The most innovative technique used by William S. Burroughs is that of cut-ups, that is the chaotic and casual way of cutting and pasting (just like in computers) pieces of text in search for new meanings. Burroughs worked on this proceeding with Brion Gysin, a strange experimental painter who was the real discoverer of this technique, and together they tried to apply it to arts in general and to all media. Not only did they apply it to paper or to canvas but also on tapes - working on tape recorders and tapes as a contemporary cyberpunk would do - and , naturally, they applied it to cinema as well. It is precisely on this technique that the short films representing Thee Films are based on (the screenplay was by Burroughs and Antony Balch was the director). Even if much time had elapsed between one film and the other, they can be interpreted in a unitary way as variations on the same subject; as a matter of fact the same images appear in the different films with an editing that is always different however fast, serial and dazing; the 
sound is equally obsessive. The recurring image of a stroboscopic cylinder (the Dream Machine) that creates optical effects, is the symbol of Balch\'s and Burroughs\' aptitude towards deconstructing and reconstructing reality until obtaining a spasm. Burroughs, Gysin and Somerville are among the interpreters of Thee Films.
