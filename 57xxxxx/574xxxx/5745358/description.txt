The very first, very rare album of Dutch speedrockers Peter Pan Speedrock. Released in March 1997 by Virgin Records. Made in just 1000 copies - but 700 of them were destroyed by Virgin, so just 300 copies are left worldwide!

This album is not that heavy and of the high quality like the later albums, the band theirselfs has surrender the album for that reason. Officially the album doesn't exist anymore and there will be no re-release.

On this album, the bassplayer is yet Bob Muileboom, who's replaced at '98s Rocketfuel by Bart Geevers. The first song, "Es ist aber nicht ein tur", is the only song they still play live now and then, but the name has meanwhile transformed to "Boom!".
