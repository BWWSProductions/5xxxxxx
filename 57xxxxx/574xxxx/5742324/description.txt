Steve is a man who has it all, a successful career, wonderful children, beautiful 
home and a loving wife. However, returning to his home after work on his birthday, 
he finds his house deserted and darkened with almost all the lightbulbs missing, 
all easy access outside cut off and a videotape waiting for him. Playing that tape, 
he watches a bizarre and grueling recording in which his wife explains her grievance 
with him, her reasons for disappearing with the children and her revenge for how he 
treated her in a way he would never forget.
