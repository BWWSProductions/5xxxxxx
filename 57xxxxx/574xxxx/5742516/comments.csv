if you ( everybody ) look at a torrent and it has no screenshots or link to boxcover/official info about the file google it and copy and paste links to the info to help everyone else out ! please dont be lazy and expect the uploaders to do everything..do it yourself , the more people stop being selfish & expecting someone else to do this the better off well all be, the piratebay may not be around forever so help out right now !"

I've had the same problems RE broken links, but I can get around it by using the magnet link if the other one doesn't work... Seems to take MUCH longer 2 start, but it will eventually work (I think...)"
