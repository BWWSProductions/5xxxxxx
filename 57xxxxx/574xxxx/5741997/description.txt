Summary

n the last few years, the Red Planet has yielded up many
new clues that life may have once existed there...and may
even exist there today. There is now have proof that water
once flowed on the surface, that Mars once had lakes, and
that the frozen poles are mostly water, not carbon dioxide
as previously thought. Mars has snow--an aurora--and
lightning generated by dust storms. Most intriguing of all
are the seasonal plumes of methane that just may point to
bacteria living below the surface.
