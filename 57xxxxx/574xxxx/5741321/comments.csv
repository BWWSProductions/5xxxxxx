Because of the need for achieving critical mass, the smallest yield bomb theoretically possible will produce the equivalent blast of about 10 tons of tnt - which would have had a dramatically different effect than all of us observed.  Inane conspiracy theories are bad enough - but can't they at least be scientifically possible?"
