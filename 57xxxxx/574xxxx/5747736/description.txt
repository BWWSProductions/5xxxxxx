Hello mates!
I got sick ov all the posers asking me "Have you heard ov the song Final Episode and Hey There Mr. Brooks?"
Well where I'm from all the posers just listen to those 2 songs and wear the shirts without even knowing who they are!
Thats a disgrace!
Stand up and Scream is a great album indeed but their EP and demo are better =D
