,FSSR.Keyno,2010-08-06T07:28Z,"so..no Italian, English, French, or German?(Audio)"
,FDNG,2010-08-07T17:59Z,Isn't Japanese the original sound? More and more directors tend to make their films more authentic by using the original voice for the local people? (See Mel Gibson's films.)
[V],black mamba TNT,2010-08-17T16:53Z,"As you can read in the description this file has several audio streams: Japanese, Italian, English, French, German.
You can simply switch among audio tracks with vlc:
Rigth click during play, audio-->audio track then choose your favourite language"
,asfbr,2010-10-24T03:40Z,yet you all must watch with the original sound.
[V],black mamba TNT,2010-10-24T15:56Z,"I'm totally agrre with you, asfbr: this is the reason because I put japanese language as first.
Anyway, when possible, I also add other languages.."
