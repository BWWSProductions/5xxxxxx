Join Marie and her equestrian friends in a game for anyone who loves ponies!

Start off by creating your own pony. you can choose the colour, the tail, the
mane style and the breed. You will have to look after your pony making sure
it is properly fed and that its stable is nice and clean.

Help Marie compete in a variety of tournaments, including show-jumping,
dressage and cross country. But beware – there are lots of riders who also
want to win the first prize rosettes, and they’ll do everything they can to make
sure you don’t win!
