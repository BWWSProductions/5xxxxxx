,AylaxAna85,2010-08-07T13:13Z,"I cant download it, the message ""No input file specified. "" comes up... anyone know why that is, and how i can fix it????"
,AylaxAna85,2010-08-07T13:14Z,"I don't know how to use the magnet link, every time i click on the link this message comes up""Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (magnet) isn't associated with any program."""

Thanks =]"
,Daftechno,2010-08-07T16:47Z,"@AylaxAna85 To fix that, in Firefox click Tools>Options>Applications Tab then scroll down the list to ""magnet"" then click on the drop-down beside it and click on ""Use Other"" then click ""Browse"" and navigate to the folder where the Torrent program you use is installed.  Click on the Torrent program (ex: uTorrent.exe) then click ""OK.""  When you try the magnet link again it should work."

,Fallen_Gri,2010-08-28T04:24Z,"Does anyone else think its weird when Claudia gets out of the car goes ""Sup Bitches""?????"
,pro_torr,2010-10-09T23:36Z,"I know people are having trouble with the torrent. You have two real choices:

1) Use the magnet link. If you're using uTorrent, when you installed it, it should have been set as the default for magnet links. Just click it and uTorrent should load it. If you're using Ubuntu, Transmission will load it and begin downloading it. 

2) You can go to http://eztv.it and search for ""Eureka"" and get it right from the source.

Either way, thank you to the uploader. And no, it's not wrong for Claudia to get out of the car and go, ""'Sup, bitches!"" It fits right in with her character."
