[V],poppedtart,2010-08-08T01:51Z,i have been messing with this source for a few hours now.  its out of sync in my mind.  in VLC add +200 ms.  or remux it with mkvmerge and add 200 ms delay to the audio track.

VLC is shit. The file plays perfectly in MPC.

try clips 34:40 and 36:12 then add +200 in VLC and play again.  Looks better to me.  Most people wont care one way or the other."
