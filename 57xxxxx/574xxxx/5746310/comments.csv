,McMerda,2012-01-13T07:40Z,"all ye asking why this wont play on your ps3 or asking what format this is or what player to use: this is .mkv format. it gets on a lot of peoples nerves. they can be complicated and annoying. .avi is much better because u can play it with damn near anything. but the hi res crazy super nerds cant stand anything but .mkv, so heres a link to a .mkv player that isnt bad for the low cost of free. http://freemkvplayer.net/"
