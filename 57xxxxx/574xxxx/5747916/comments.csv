,dardardar67,2010-08-11T13:09Z,"gotta love the spammers.....they are so amusing in their pathetic little ways. We all want to kill them at first but after ya get used to em ya just feel sorry for em. They must have miserable,boring lives if the only thing to do with their time is to annoy other ppl. Have pity on these poor deluded souls."
