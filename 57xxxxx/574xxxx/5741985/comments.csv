,bluecar5556,2010-12-17T06:35Z,"     Did you hear the shocking news?  According to  http://www.demandprogress.org  Glen Greenwald reports that U.S. Army Private Bradley Manning is being tortured.  Manning is accused of leaking unflattering information about the Afghanistan war to WikiLeaks, but hasn't been convicted of -- or even tried for -- any crime.
     Manning is being held at the U.S. Marine brig in Quantico, and according to Greenwald:

Manning has been subjected for many months without pause to inhumane, personality-erasing, soul-destroying, insanity-inducing conditions of isolation similar to those perfected at America's Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado:  all without so much as having been convicted of anything. 
     Torture is outrageous and un-American, demand fair treatment of Private Manning by going to the following URL :  

http://act.demandprogress.org/go/23?akid=45.326698.TIM73u&t=1

To demand an end to Private Manning's torture and call on the Army to give him a trial or set him free, also go to this URL :

,bluecar5556,2011-02-22T08:58Z,"wikileaks is more than likely a CIA front as a gateway to perusing the 'Combating Infringement and Counterfeits Act.'  It is called Problem, Reaction, Solution.  They create a problem 'leaked' emails and documents, the reaction is purposing the 'Combating Infringement and Counterfeits Act' which is a more intimidating term for Internet censorship and the solution is to join the rest of the several countries that already have their internet censored.  To put it bluntly, Wikileaks is nothing more than Israeli propaganda by the jewish supremacy that have dominated world media and entertainment, soon to be the world if people don't wake up."
