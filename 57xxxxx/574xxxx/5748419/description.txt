Igor Presnyakov is a guitarist/composer/arranger/singer with a Russian origin. 
He was born in Moscow and currently lives in The Netherlands.
In Russia he has studied classical guitar where he graduated as a guitarist and a conductor for ensembles.
Except for his solo performances he also works with various artists.
Thirty five years of playing the guitar gave Igor great experience: 
a fusion of different music genres from classical to world music with a jazz/pop flavour. 
Igor also plays the Russian 7-string guitar which was very popular in Russia in the 19th century. 
Only a few guitarists in the world play the 7-string guitar on a professional level. 
He has already made appearances on different TV and Radio shows. 
In 2004 Igor was performing on the prestigious 34th International Fingerpicking Contest in Winfield (Kansas) USA. 
Igor is a performing artist who gives concerts on a national and international basis. 
His music also appeared in a play "Six Years" by Sharr White , 
which was recently played by the MomentumTheatreGroup at the Lex Theatre in Hollywood.
