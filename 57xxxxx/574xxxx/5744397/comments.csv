,S_Smoke,2010-08-13T19:45Z,Everything is looking good.  Only thing is it appears that Season one Ep 1/2 has an audio delay of about a half second to a second after the text intro.
,S_Smoke,2010-08-14T07:13Z,Additional: Season 1 Ep 06 Appears to have no audio track...
[T],Mattlb0619,2010-08-15T02:17Z,"ty smoke.. sry about that.

,OG_Loc,2010-09-23T05:39Z,"I'm not one to split hairs over free shit, but how do you not notice out of sync audio on the very first video..."
,OG_Loc,2010-09-23T05:42Z,Oh man episode 6 too? This throws the quality of the rest of the videos into question!
,goopy69,2010-11-08T06:37Z,"Hey Mattlb0619:

,Sylvarion,2011-01-21T11:40Z,"This really needs more seeders :)
says theres 39 on Vuze but on here says 80
also what format are the videos? will i need a specific program to play it?"
,kyleb001,2011-02-12T04:10Z,"Hi, i've heard some comments regarding audio delay, is this still an issue? If anyone has up-to-date info I'd love to hear it"
,rebelr19,2011-02-16T19:53Z,"Thank you for your upload Matt!

Video quality and file size are quite good!

Everything is great except for Ep. 06 of Season 1. I also have the sound track problems described by others. The filename Star Trek DS9 S01E06.mp4

I read your posts regarding looking at your homesite, but no way to find it anywhere...

Can you post your homesite URL here please?

Anyway... I am thankful for your upload! And I am seeding..."
,rebelr19,2011-02-16T22:21Z,"Sylvarion:

Quoting Matt's information post on top of the page:

Container                        : MPEG-4 (.mp4)

You don't need any special player to play mp4 video files, Windows Media Player or Media Center can read and play them quite well on your PC."
,kKotton,2011-02-23T03:38Z,"I just finished watching Star Trek TNG... im not looking forward to downloading another whole series again -.-"""
,kKotton,2011-02-23T23:10Z,"disregard that last post

the best thing about trekkies:

They're great seeders ;D"
,realityfusion,2011-05-26T02:18Z,Media Player Classic : Audio Options : Offset 525ms will fix ep 1-2
,dustofseven,2011-06-02T16:29Z,the 1st episode. get VLC media or whatever can adjust audio track....its .06 seconds on VLC out of sync..move it forward....tards :P
,dlighted,2011-06-02T21:51Z,"watched up to season 3. quite a number is out of sync, with no 'standard' time it's off. some are minor and bearable.

as mentioned, use vlc to sync it manually. "
,OMGsohardtofindaname,2011-06-22T20:36Z,Thanks for the download will seed forever
,Neo_aeoN,2011-08-23T18:22Z,So... if someone hasn't commented on rest of seasons (>3) I am guessing they got tired of our of sync issues? Can ANYONE confirm this? Bummer for uL'er cos thats a lot of bandwidth. Peace 
,matteff,2011-09-02T07:19Z,"audio is out of sync, video is poor quality. don't bother."
,Sine91,2011-09-10T06:58Z,Cheers bro =D Fantastic torrent the OOS audio in S01E01&2 can easily be fixed by downloading the K-lite Codec pack and using media player classic; or by transcoding the RAW you have through the FFDshow encoder with the time shift feature tuned.
,Draco297,2011-09-13T22:51Z,"Wish I would of read more  on comments before downloading this,i wasted about 2 hours downloading first episode,and yes,Audio and Video Syncronization are off.."
,philip1201,2011-09-15T22:00Z,"S1E1,2 has an audio delay of Âą550 ms. I'm not sure about the other ones. 
IF YOU USE VLC:
On windows, use ctrl-k to increase audio delay and ctrl-l to decrease it until it fits.
On mac OS, use g and f to increase and decrease audio delay respectively. This way, you should be able to watch it without difficulty."
,pin6appl6,2012-04-23T22:47Z,"Came back to give a summary:

PROS
-very fast download
-small file sizes

CONS
-there are occasional episodes with audio-sync issues (you can use VLC to fix, it's annoying but at least the delay doesn't 'drift')
-at least a third of the episodes are quite bad video quality, the rest are 'just ok'

So, you have your choice. I would like to thank the original uploader."
