[T],ctang,2010-08-06T16:25Z,more seeders soon guys...if you are thinking about waiting bc you think its going to be slow then now is the time to download bc its about to have a ton of seeders
[T],ctang,2010-08-06T18:32Z,im happy with those numbers...i guess i just need to start putting up more newer movies and hopefully people will start looking more at all my torrents
[T],ctang,2010-08-06T18:35Z,i just checked the top 100 dvdr's and wonder how the heck sailo1 has the amount of seeders he does...its crazy
[T],ctang,2010-08-06T20:08Z,"i asked him if he did and he told me that he didnt put them up on other sites, just tpb

it doesnt say it yet but there are over 100 seeders"

[T],FatFreddy007,2010-08-06T21:56Z,"I first put on TPB, to upload 95/100%. then i posted on other websites.
example: ""Leap Year (2010)"" I've only uploaded in TPB. then I go out and posted on other websites."
,torontocanada,2010-08-06T22:01Z,"hey ctang.... thx for the dl's... i left a message with seedkey, but maybe i'll ask u as well... dl'd his clash of the titans, but cant open up with nero recode or dvdclone2 (which i mostly use).. his files dont show as individual Video_TS, only as one Image file, and only open with NeroBurn... are his up'l settings different from yours and djfreds etc> ?  (thanks again in advance!)"
,Htaed_Doolb,2010-08-07T02:26Z,thanks bro excelent torrent
[T],ctang,2010-08-07T05:55Z,"@cafun107: just checked the subtitles and they seem to be fine...checked on my computer and on the dvd player

@Seedkey:  what other sited do you post on?

@torontocanada:  you have to burn it with imgburn since it is an image (.iso) or use some other program that supports image files...let me know if that helps

@tater44: unfortunately i dont but you should ask omegafox84, he said that he has a lot of jackie chan movies

@everyone else:  your welcome"
,Metal1Dead,2010-08-07T12:08Z,"hollymolly 85 seeders , thats a green light for me !lol"
[T],ctang,2010-08-08T02:14Z,"@metal1dead:  hell ya!!!

,GUYMOVIE,2010-08-08T09:49Z,THANK YOU MAN LOOKING FORWARD FOR THE RELEASE........
,cafun107,2010-08-13T03:39Z,For me they look grey which is barely readable and way tooo bold or thick that you have to try hard to assume what they said
,cafun107,2010-08-13T03:42Z,"Ok i know this has nothing to do with this forum.....but does anyone know how to convert PAL format to NTSC format, cause men there some good movies out there but they are PAL with boatloads of seeders unlike NTSC!!!!!"
