The main problem with MP3 is that most people use Joint Stereo, which isn't even stereo at all. So called MP3 Stereo isn't either, but it's better than joint. The only way to get decent MP3 sound is with Dual Channel/Dual Stereo. This is the ONLY MP3 format that gives you independant left and right."

Anyway, thanks for downloading, I am seeding, but I live a fair way from the local telephone exchange, so speed is a little slow. Your patience will reward you!"
