I've uploaded this FLAC rip of Miranda Cosgrove's album, since I didn't feel the MP3 files quite did the album justice.

I'm a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to sound quality!


Track List:

1. Kissin' U
2. BAM
3. Disgusting
4. Shakespeare
5. Hey You
6. There Will Be Tears
7. Oh Oh
8. Daydream
9. Brand New You
10. What Are You Waiting For
11. Beautiful Mess
12. Adored
13. Charlie

Remember, this is a FLAC version of the album, so you'll need the right software to play it - VLC player does the job fine for me. There are two MP3 versions of this album available on TPB, but I didn't find the sound quality quite satisfactory when I tried them myself - probably since she sings so many high notes which would be more likely to be lost in the compression.

Enjoy!
