,kareru,2010-08-05T14:36Z,"wow thanks

from the looks of the screencaps the video looks impeccable, in fact i didn't even know that there was a tekken movie till just now, so i went on the IMDB link and found out there is no King or Paul

i mean WTF? if anything there should be no Eddie because as we all know in a 2 player game it is illegal to play as Eddie due to endless button bashing. "
,kenntoft,2010-08-05T17:55Z,@kareru haha you are right! But I will enjoy the movie anyway:)
,AskMeHowYouToCanSayFU,2010-08-05T21:14Z,"FYI - This film was made several months back and news of it, including a trailer circulated several movie news sites like www.screenrant.com (where I first saw it) and there was much speculation that it might end up being a direct to DVD Release even though that was not the original plan when they made it. 

So this is most likely exactly will appear on the DVD Rental shelves in the next month or less."
