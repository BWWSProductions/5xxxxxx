[b]About these files:[/b]
[color=blue]I have been working on these for some months after finding them on various file-sharing sites.
I've noticed some are now being posted as torrents so have rushed this before they end up here.
Because there were many, many issues with them which I have now sorted?

Were 48k Mono 1 Channel
Now 64k 2 Channel

Levels were mixed as I doubt they came from the same person.
Levels now match, ish.

Endings and starts missing. 
Fixed so all now have them and fade in and out.

Unedited - 1 had 22 mins extra on a 12 minute ep.

Naming of these were poor to say the least.
Each case was checked and re-named so a Google should find the case if you want to read more.

Was > E23_Scheuring___Hasen
Should be and now is > Jens Soering & Elizabeth Haysom
Was > E17_Stark_Weather.
Should be and now is > Charles Raymond Starkweather 

As you can see you would never find more details on cases with such poor naming.


The quality on some of these is not great.[/color]
