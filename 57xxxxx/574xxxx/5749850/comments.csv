,upichie,2011-04-20T19:37Z,"""02 - Kiara"" is cut off at 3:10, whereas all my other versions of the song last for 3:50. It ends abruptly, sounding awful when played in a playlist.

Thank you for ruining beautiful music, you fucking retard. =]"

Kiara cuts at 3:10, whole torrent ruined from this one mistake in transcoding. For shame uploader."
