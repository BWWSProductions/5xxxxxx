"Static"

After returning to town, Joe's troubles worsen
as he suffers from frightening side effects
caused by his "reeducation." The rest of the
group is left wondering whether they would
simply be better off without him. Concerned by
the chaotic mess the town has become, the
Director of "The Program" sends a surprising
new night manager and second-in-command, Liam
Ulrich (Alan Smyth) to restore order.
Meanwhile, Renbe (Gerald Kyd) and Kat (Lola
Glaudini) get raided by local South American
police, which ends in Renbe's arrest.

Enjoy :)
