Charles Sullivan (wikilink) is an underrated, obscure jazz trumpter best known for his album Genesis for Strata East Records. He also released Re-entry for Whynot Records and Kamau for Arabesque Records, all three of which are presented here in MP3 for download by bittorrent. I haven't uploaded a torrent in a while. Make sure to check this great music out.
