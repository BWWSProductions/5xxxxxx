,mario001,2010-09-03T21:53Z,"replace 2.0ga's \ecs\install\register.dll  with 2.0rc7's and use reg key below:

EN12UP20 & all zero

good luck."
,garfield1234,2010-09-05T19:33Z,"EN12UP20 & all zero ? meaning instead EN12UP20 you replace with all zero ;
 EN12UP20 AND all zero ;
EN12UP20 & all zero ???!! THX!!"
,raptorycp,2010-09-06T13:35Z,"dforell is it mario001 way?

Will try this later..."
,Patzilla,2010-10-11T10:45Z,"Tried mario001:s suggestion about replacing register.dll with the one from with Ecomstation 2.0rc7.
It works!
I failed however to fully install Ecomstation. That has probably nothing to do with the password, but more with the computer I tried install it on.
Programs needed Magic Iso & Image burner
1. Download 2.0rc7 and extracted the register.dll ( \ecs\install\register.dll) (use Magic iso or a virtual CD reader, like Deamon tools)
2. Replace 2.0 GA:s, using the Magic iso program. ( \ecs\install\register.dll) 
(if you just copy the eCS20_cd1_en_us.iso into a folder, replace the register.dll - you wont fit the content onto a new cd with a burning program like Nero; it is simply too big!) 
3. Burne CD (with image burner)
4. Install Ecomstation 2.0 using:
Username: EN12up20
Serial: 00000000000-00000000000-00000000000-00000000000-00000000000-00000000000-00000000000-00000000000"
,xakXOLAS,2010-11-08T19:31Z,name  and key is fine?
,segin,2010-12-23T11:03Z,"For the ""EN12UP20"" code to work, you need to edit the .iso image for eCS 2.0 GA, disc 1.

Grab eComStation 2.0 Release Candidate 7: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5063260/eComStation_2.0_RC7_Silver_Release_(OS2)

Get a program that'll allow you to extract or mount ISO images. Grab \ECS\INSTALL\REGISTER.DLL from the eCS 2.0 RC7 ISO, extract it somewhere.

Get Magic ISO: http://thepiratebay.org/search/Magic%20ISO/0/7/0

Open eCS20_cd1_en_us.zip and extract the .iso image within. Open the .iso image in Magic ISO. Replace the \ECS\INSTALL\REGISTER.DLL with the one you extracted from eCS 2.0 RC7.

Save the modified ISO, burn to disk, install with:
Username: EN12up20
Serial: 00000000000-00000000000-00000000000-00000000000-00000000000-00000000000-00000000000-00000000000

That's it! For those that think that this is a whole lot of work, ever downloaded a game where you have to replace an .exe with a cracked one for the game to work? This is the same thing, except that you need to replace the file on an .iso image (like editing a LiveCD)

If you do not replace the .dll, then the serial above won't work. If you do replace the .dll and it still doesn't work, try actually paying for eComStation.

If you can't figure this all out, then you're just too stupid to enjoy OS/2 anyways, quit bothering us with your stupid questions written in horribly broken English and just go away, you're just annoying everyone else.

And for those that got it to work, congratz. Go get yourself Odin and run Windows apps on it. (Odin is based on Wine, but it's not up-to-date and most stuff doesn't work right with it.)"
,maxcrabs,2011-02-13T03:09Z,"its already hacked, get this:

,n1nj4Lo,2011-03-04T21:07Z,"EN12UP20 and all 0's key doesn't work anymore.... I'm getting tired of this, I've got like 5 or 6 eComStation cd's and none of them work... Even the one that I made and imported a real register.dll with that was said to be valid and allowed me to continue with the installation didn't work... Something wrong with installation or whatever IDK, and I have no idea where that CD Is anymore."
,andremo,2011-04-06T19:16Z,"Patching the iso with the file from the version linked in the comments, and entering the suggested serial doesn't apepar to work. 
However, I recall, to install an 1.2 release, one had to edit the iso file, and patch some file by simply uncommenting the register.dll file. 
I've googled but I cannot seem to find any site mentioning this patch, and I don't recall which file was needed for this. 
And I am not even sure if this patch is also valid for 2.0 versions"
,andremo,2011-04-06T19:47Z,"Correction: the all zero patch does work after all.
The ""problem"" is that the boxes take an input longer then visible. Be carefull not to enter too many zeros in the boxes."
