Faye Reagan - Shorting The Game
Added: August 05, 2010

"Faye has been a sports agent for years, her biggest signing being the acquisition of Jordan Ash to the Las Vegas Lions, however this was 6 years ago and Jordan is losing his steam. Faye cant make money out from him directly so she decides to bet against him on a huge game, Jordan soon finds out and the revolt begins."
