Installed app, then ran ""DVDFab 7.x Registration.exe""

Black terminal window appeared, files were copied. then it reports in green text:
""Sorry must be a problem, please report this error to author..""

I tried copying and running ""DVDFab 7.x Registration.exe"" from the DVDfab install folder.

Any ideas?"
