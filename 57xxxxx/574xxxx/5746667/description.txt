Just an installer I made to get Lord of the Rings - Battle for Middle Earth 2 to work
Since getting the game to work on my Win 7 computer was tricky, I decided to make a 
script so that others don't have to go through the same thing.

This script also installs the latest update, and applies the NO-CD patch.

Please comment on the torrent so that others can know that this isn't a virus.
Thanks :)

Please enable DHT in your torrent client to download this, I didn't add any web trackers.
