Let me know if it makes your game work too, I want to know."

time-saver indeed. thanks heaps and appreciate it. registered just so i can thank you."
,CodaBrink,2010-08-19T08:07Z,Awesome! Thanks for the feedback!
,Stark1276,2010-08-24T05:08Z,Hey it didn't work for me. I had downloaded the patch to try to play online and I figured that this would fix it but it didn't. all it does is go to the green screen when it first starts up and then stops responding. any ideas on how to fix? please help
,CodaBrink,2010-08-25T02:41Z,"Windows XP, Vista, 7... Wine?"
,Stark1276,2010-08-25T06:45Z,i have windows 7 and the game worked before I use Daemon tools. and i got the 1.06 patch for the online play and I tried to use one of the other no cd cracks and now it doesn't work at all it just goes to the Lord of the rings screen right when you start it up and it freezes
,CodaBrink,2010-08-25T23:45Z,"This torrent updates the game to 1.06 automatically, then applies the no cd patch, creates an Options.ini in your profile folder with default options and creates a folder in your profile called ""Maps"" so the game wont crash.

Have you tried fully removing the game, then just running the file from this torrent?"
,wtflolhehe,2010-09-24T13:06Z,Can you make a fix for Rise of the Witch King too?
,wtflolhehe,2010-09-24T13:07Z,can you make a fix for rise of the witch king too?

,cisslayer,2011-01-08T15:51Z,"@Coda Brink

Thanks a lot for the the patch! I could finally start playing the game. 

When I go to play Multiplayer, (LAN) I get a ""Data Loss Error"" suggesting the other client is running a modified version. (all comps have your patch)

Any suggestions?

I have windows 7 ult, And i have the orginal game. I removed the game first and installed it again. Then used your fix but no luck. With loading the game it stops. 

Do you know anything else to do?"
,CodaBrink,2011-03-16T18:09Z,"@donarthegrey Sorry man, I don't have any suggestions. It appears to work for most, but not all."

,Tenchzen,2011-04-10T18:44Z,"@CodaBrink Ive used this to get BFME2 working im just curious what u did because i get all the same errors with EA Cracks when they use a Game.dat exp..(Splash screen then nothing) Same with BfME2 The witch king
Command and Conquer Generals. I only have problems with those games out of th 500 i cracked already. i even got assassins creed 2 working easier than this game so if u could tell me what the crash fix does so i can apply it to the other games as well.... thx btw thanks for this Torrent. I use Win 7 64 HP"
,Tenchzen,2011-04-11T20:14Z,"****For all who experience the splash screen then crash****

You must put the options.ini(Create a Txt file) into
C:\Users\username\appdata\roaming\my lord of the rings the rise of the witch king or my battle for middle earth(tm) II files

In the txt file copy and paste this into it

AudioLOD = High
FlashTutorial = 0
HasSeenLogoMovies = yes
IdealStaticGameLOD = High
Resolution = 1024 768
StaticGameLOD = High
SuppressCahPromo = false
TimesInGame = 0

Game will start with update and crack now flawlessly

I think i know why it doesn't work for some people ( including me ) the folder created in appdata is My Battle For Middle Earth 2 ... isn't the right folder if you dont install it in english."
,SHEePYTaGGeRNeP,2011-04-23T13:29Z,"I fixed it for me, you must cut the file and folder in the by BFME2 folder that CodaBrink created and paste it in the folder created by BFME2 itself! I can play the game."

,Quewe,2012-01-28T16:16Z,"Im using Windows XP, I downloaded the game perfectly and got it installed. But when Im going to play a skirmish the game crashes at 97 % and I get the message saying ""game.dat has had an unexpected error and has to shut down"". So basicly, I wonder if this fix will fix my problem even tho I dont have Windows 7? 
Thanks in advance"
,CodaBrink,2012-02-28T06:31Z,@alexfodor It's a false positive. Antivirus companies do that a lot.
,CodaBrink,2012-02-28T06:32Z,@Queue - I really doubt it would fix your problem. You've updated to the latest version?
