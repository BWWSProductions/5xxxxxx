- Federal Judge Strikes Down California Same-Sex Marriage Ban in Major Victory for Gay Rights Advocates

A federal judge struck down Proposition 8, the state's voter approved ban on same-sex marriages on Wednesday. In his ruling, U.S. District Court Chief Judge Vaughn Walker wrote, "Proposition 8 fails to advance any rational basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of a marriage license. The evidence shows Proposition 8 does nothing more than enshrine in the California Constitution the notion that opposite-sex couples are superior to same-sex couples."


- EXCLUSIVE...Emily Henochowicz Speaks Out: Art Student Who Lost Her Eye After Being Shot by Israeli Tear Gas Canister in West Bank Protest Discusses Her Life, Her Art, and Why She Plans to Return

Today, a Democracy Now global broadcast exclusive interview with Emily Henochowicz. She's the 21 year-old American art student who lost her eye in May after being shot in the face by an Israeli tear gas canister at a protest against Israel's attack on the Gaza flotilla that left nine people dead. "I'm not ashamed of the fact that I lost my eye. I'm proud of who I am. I believed in the cause and that's why I came to that demonstration on that day," Henochowicz says. "I'm not going to be the same person that I was before this happened."
