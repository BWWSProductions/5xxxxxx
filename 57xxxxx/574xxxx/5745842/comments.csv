,jon4fun,2010-08-08T17:02Z,"@ houruoha - in regards to torrents it is an internal issue with TPB. 
If you log out and log in you will see ALL your torrents listed.
There appears to have been a break in the link between the DB and the webserver pages.

I have no idea of TPB are going to 'eventually' rectify this issue.
