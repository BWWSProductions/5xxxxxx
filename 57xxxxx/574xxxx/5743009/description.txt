This was Bronson's last Virginian guest appearance 
and TV role before moving to Europe to make bad 
movies for a few yeas.  He wouldn't return to TV 
until he was in an HBO movie in 1986.

Also in the guest cast are Miriam Colon as his wife,
Charles Grodin, and Don Mitchell....shortly before
he played Mark Sanger on Ironside, where Don would
spend the next 8 years pushing Raymond Burr around
in a wheelchair.
