,adevow,2010-08-08T22:50Z,ESET reports this release as clean.I have used it and everything seems to work OK.
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-08-09T00:17Z,"of course it's clean, was done today aiming passion alone... no need to scan it cause it only has added some reg instructions within... those using infected stuff are very cheap minded...they do not use their brain but rather the work of others, over which they 've learned to attach infected code hopping to fool naive ones...this is cheap beyond any measure. 

thanks anyway, 
i do never dream making infected things and hate to death the narrow minded that does.."
[V],Anacondaz,2010-08-09T15:35Z,"thanks for another nice upload mate
keep up ur gud work
long live tpb"
,tomaashe,2010-08-10T19:02Z,"Thanks for the upload.  ... Can I ask a question: why do you say it is version 10, if the version 10 was not published yet and the uploaded program itself says it is version 9?  "
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-08-10T19:58Z,"tomaashe, there is no shame in wearing glasses, you know ?

You cannot make me enter the official website to fetch for you the proof link, so that my IP remain logged... I am much to wise to fall for it ;)))

you too are invited to download, test and use the version 10 !

cheers"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-08-11T05:42Z,"This is NOT the official website installer, and also it's not the offcial scene released portable version. The size of this installer is 11.9 MB, while the website installer is 12 MB. At file properties this file is also missing some tabs.

So the question is: what is this exactly?"
,tomaashe,2010-08-11T06:46Z,"I was not sarcastic.  I stated a simple question.  The download stated it should be version 10; however, after installation and testing, the program itself shows version 9.  That's all.  "
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-08-11T12:19Z,"RobbingHood 
with all respect but maybe you are not robin hood either..

This is official, for you search Softpedia, software mega portal !
About the so called ""scene"" release , the so called ""portable"" version made by a dumb fuck it weights 43 megas...and it's launching it ends shootin right in an error message... mark my words: ANY EVISCERATED BRAIN could press a few clicks using ThinApp (ex Thinstall) and imagine himself being a releaser or rather a scene show releaser... a galactic programmer... although I feel that No... but None at all, the need to explain to you or to any... yet I tell you this is exactly the official registry mechanic version 10 (newest version) the twin made registered and preselected the best options into the ""Options""  table of this piece of software, recompressed using lzma2 with the switch /ultra ...so please ...the only thing that is missing here is you lack of knowledge brother... I am really tired of lofty nostrils in vain...if you could grasp that ideea... go release .avi,  .mkv, mp4 ..use 1 click converters...make what you like the most...but let software for soft minds, ok friend ? sorry for being so bitchy but to that comments... this replies !

stop spaming and suspect my hard work...beaware of yours instead...cause you...you could easily slip an infection here cause you use the works of others you do never understand...but I will never post such a thing cause it is opened, operated and closed with skill and no ill intention to harm ...if you find anything in any of my torrents THEN YOU CAN SPEAK or else keep quiet...for free suspicion and not knowing anything as well, 

well did it, don't I ? :))  "

May I choose not to speak with somebody who's skill might not qualify him as a PC user able to uninstall his own old version (the 9th), in order to properly install and use the tenth ? ;)))))))

rush in using your PC to install and uninstall then we might even talk "
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-08-11T12:29Z,"@RobbingHood , If this is not the official installer I might take into consideration to accept some fee from you...cause I am then such a fine producer of such a fine software, not a demo, by the way ...  ;))))))))))))))

that's all guys, i ve laughed so loud...all the romanians heared me, at least my closest neighbours ;)))"
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-08-11T12:40Z,"hey guys, it also has a different icon... ;)))))))))) I wonder how was that passed by and not being mentioned as a simulated reproch...

I do not need your ""thanks"" 

I keep doing this for myself, for the computers i install...and for time to time even sharing like now... 
so take it or leave it ...CAUSE ELSE IT SMELLS LIKE A DIRTY INTEREST IN WHAT YOU DO  ;)

TELL ME HOW MUCH IT PAYS YOU TO TRY MOCKERING MY WORK ? ;)))

WELL GO BACK AND TELL THEM THAT ...WITH OR WITHOUT THIS ACCOUNT, WITH OR WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION .. I'LL KEEP EXTRACTING INSTALLERS, CRAKING IT'S CORE, REMAKING THEM ...because i had some gooooog gurus around...that teached me ;)"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-08-11T15:26Z,"@do_not_delete_me_blindly 

I've asked a simple and normal question, so what's your problem? Go ahead keep labelling your stuff wrong and flaming without a reaon, and good luck with your uploaders career.

Oh yeah, you're welcome to vistit ""TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments"":

[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-08-11T15:41Z,"The only thing wrong labeled here is you, ok ?
Do you imagine that i stood creating this ?
No ! i did it in a few minutes, using the original ...how many times do I have to tell you that this installer is extracted, content cracked and recompilled ?

 DO I HAVE TO DRAW IT TO YOU ? ;))) 

It is time for you to learn taking care of what you say, at once !

i 've just said above that you got it wrong obviously because YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND A THING AROUND YOU and now you continue doing it again...

regarding the most ridiculous phorum comments... I appreciate you finally found your toy, it suits you... 
In what language do I have to tell you to shut up (at least till you understand what you yourself choose to ridiculously comment ?

I am not used to comment on what I do not know...and my guess is that so should you and anybody

Untill you learn the ABC for installers... please shut up and dance

cheers ;)"
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-08-11T15:48Z,"LET OTHERS DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES AND SHUT THE HELL UP, YOU ARE WRONG !

you are doing this because of envy, of self uselessness... of a strange wrath of ADHD that you seem to have ;)))

keep away from what you do not know boy...
it is the wisest thing to do ;)
I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT, YOU WANT TO SHOW YOURSELF IMPORTANT... WHILE THIS IS THE PRODUCT IT SAYS YOU ARE JUST TRYING TO SIMULATE KNOWLEDGE... BLEAH IT IS THE MOST SUPERFICIAL THING I HATE AT LASY, PRETENDING HUMANS, BORED TO DEATH OF WHAT THEY ARE ;)

YOU TALK TO ME WHEN YOU YOURSELF WILL UNDERSTAND NOT TO SAY DO WHAT I'VE DONE, OK ?

ZBYE , FOR GOOD!"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-08-11T16:18Z,For someone who doesn't know the word PRECRACKED you're making quite some noise. That's exactly what's misleading about the torrent name. But go ahead and let all your frustrations out ... and take your time for it.
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-08-11T16:55Z,"hahahahaaaaa i've just proved to you that your's it's not ok, that simply entering the name and serial you cannot bypass the protections of this... you have to crack update.exe, upgrade.exe, regmech.exe and to eliminate service that installs permanently this soft...service named startsmansvc.exe...look into your task manager and you will find it and you will not be able to get rid of it hahahaaaaa, I've told you not to mess with the Zohan here ;)))) MINE IS WELL DONE , UNDOES EVEN WHAT YOURS DOES !!! IT DELETS THIAT SERVICE BY SIMPLE INSTALLATION OF MINE... 

NEXT TIME TAKE CARE AND BEHAVE WITH ELDERLY 

hahahahahaaa

with friendship, the older one ;))"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-08-12T00:25Z,"@do_not_delete_me_blindly

I apologize, and forget the whole issue. I didn't realize that you're an idiot or have huge mental problems. Maybe even both, which would explain a lot.

Hasta la vista baby; case closed."
