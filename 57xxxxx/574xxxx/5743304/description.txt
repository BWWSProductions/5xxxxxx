 
In the age-old battle between cats and dogs, one crazed feline has taken things a paw too far. Kitty Galore, formerly an agent for cat spy organization MEOWS, has gone rogue and hatched a diabolical plan to not only bring her canine enemies to heel, but take down her former kitty comrades and make the world her scratching post. Faced with this unprecedented threat, cats and dogs will be forced to join forces for the first time in history in an unlikely alliance to save themselves and their humans.

Release Notes:
Right, thanks to relizlab for video and TA For audio, got some video off my russian friend same cam, but was only 700mb
so opted for the one with better bitrate , anyway tweaked all the colours mainly the red, gave it quite a bit of
brightness seemed pretty dark to me, slight change in contrast and saturation, now many of you would notice that the image
was pulling to the side, just used a simple filter in vdub to fix it, lost a bit of video not much, but looks better imo
audio ain't great but it's decent enough for this movie. Enjoy
