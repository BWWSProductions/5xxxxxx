Exile: Arc by Jack Lance


In the deep future a terrorist is sent from a perfect society to a city of exile. Alone and suffering amnesia he formulates a plan to manipulate his way back to freedom. A tale to reflect our own society, told from the narrative of the proverbial 'bad guy', and his extreme yet Machiavellian methods.
