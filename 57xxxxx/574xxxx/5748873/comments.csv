,GSBuser,2010-08-10T19:21Z,How do I use a magnet link. Firefox says it doesn't know what to do with it because no program is associated with it.
,XrastasX,2010-08-11T12:25Z,"Try clicking on magnet link

Im using firefox & bittorrent its working for me"
,MAH415,2010-08-14T03:19Z,"Yea for some reason link is not working. On my screen it says the link has an invalid input or something. Anyways, this is the first and probably only mess up i will or have seen affiliated with the eztv name..."
,Lady_Bronco,2010-08-18T01:46Z,"This broken link has made me realize how awesome eztv is.  I can't find a decent copy of this episode from anyone else here!  I tried every other dl of this episode, and there are problems with all of them.  Hopefully this isn't a recurring problem..."
,teamrican,2010-08-25T16:52Z,"Use the Magnet Link!  If your browser doesn't know what application to use, this shouldn't matter since YOU know what application to use and can pick it yourself (it's your bit torrent client- utorrent, vuze, bitlord, whatever).  And if you use google chrome it will probably associate automatically if you don't want to pick the correct program out of a list.  "
