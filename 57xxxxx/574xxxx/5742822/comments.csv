A: 10
V: 10
I was wondering, not to be greedy or anything, but can someone share a BRRIP/BDRIP version with 720 width and 304 height?  I would REALLY appreciate it, thanx, later days."

And no, I don't have FAT32 system, I've got Vista so it's NTFS, but it still can't handle it.
If there is in fact some sort of cure for this thing, I'd be thankful if someone would mention it."

NTFS handles 4GB files easily with no problems. Hell I use Windows 7 and I've got tons of 20GB+ files with no issues."
