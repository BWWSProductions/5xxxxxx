Shock Treatment OST by Richard O'Brien

Richard O'Brien's sequel to The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

This is already up here, but by the torrent owners own admission the quality isn't too hot. Here it is ripped from a brand new CD with EAC.

I have split Denton, U.S.A. so that the Commercial Break can be accessed as a separate track.

I have also moved the intro of Duel Duet from the end of Breaking Out to the beginning of Duel Duet.
