,soulmanice,2011-06-25T19:01Z,"Beware that this torrent contains edited versions of the episodes made in the 1940s and 50s. It's not the uploader's fault, they're like that on the DVDs. For the unedited, uncensored episodes, go here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5376566/Tom_and_Jerry_-_The_Complete_Uncensored_Hanna-Barbera_Classics"
