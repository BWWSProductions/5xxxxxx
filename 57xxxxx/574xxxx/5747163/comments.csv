[T],FatFreddy69,2010-08-10T18:54Z,"German hardcoded subs for the Spanish speaking(they were originally on blue-ray so don't blame me), meanwhile English Forced Subs are default so English Forced (srt) will display over the German, I recommend you change display color of subs in your player (neon-green for instance).
They are just a few short Spanish parts.
Italians can switch to Forced Italian sub."

Somebody knows which codec I have to use?
Tnx."
,e_mc22,2011-01-01T18:35Z,VLC player plays it well.
,dlectro,2011-02-18T19:54Z,"The second English sub track is only for the English dialogue, it's blank for the Spanish dialogue.

So you get English subs for either the Spanish dialogue or the remainder English dialogue, but not both. You have to switch back and forth."

Why don't you complain at bluray.com & amazon.
I ripped all subs from blu-ray. I can't do more.
Others don't even rip the English sub, not to speak about 20 subs."
