Plot: 
An overlooked gem written and directed by the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright of "The Subject Was Roses" THE GIG is the story of six middle-aged men and the once-a-week basement jam session they've been having for years, just for their own enjoyment. Wayne Rogers is a used car dealer who handles the slide trombone; Jerry Matz is a clarinet teacher with an inflated view of his own talents; Daniel Nalbach, the drum-playing dentist and bachelor who lives with his ailing mother; Stan Lachow, a quiet bassist; Andrew Duncan, a corporate type who comes to life only when he pounds a keyboard; and real-life musician Warren Vache as a superb trumpeter who passed up a musical career to marry Susan Egbert, the daughter of a wealthy real estate magnate. Rogers learns about a two-week gig available at a Catskill Mountains resort and proposes they take the job to see if they can hack it as working musicians. When Lachow becomes hospitalized with cancer, the men recruit a genuine pro (played by the late Cleavon Little) to fill in. When the motley band reach the resort, musical dreams and reality collide.
