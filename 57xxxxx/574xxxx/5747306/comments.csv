,hstlr,2010-09-19T23:05Z,"YOU MUST REMEMBER TO SEED. Seriously, for at least a few hours. Come on.

I spent over 12 hours waiting for a single MB to be sent after reaching 62.8%! Got pissed, went searching, and eventually settled for an extremely slow direct download overnight.

Just replaced the torrent's incomplete ""SUITE814.iso"" on my system and forced a re-check. Sure enough, it's back in business.

Apparently some people have been stuck for days. It's a PEER EXCHANGE for fuck's sake. Don't be a douche. Seed after your download completes. Quid pro quo!

I hope you all enjoy."

A GUI is a graphical user interface, you just need to drag it into the Live window."

,relaxitsleon,2011-12-12T01:42Z,"can someone write step by step instructions on out to install this? i am a mac noob. 

here's what ive done so far:
i downloaded to torrent, and put the folder from the torrent into Applications

did ""show package contents"" by right clicking ""Live"" inside the folder ""Live 8.1.4 OS X"" 
->opened ""Contents""->MacOS->found the exec Live file.

got ""LivePatch"" and ""Authorize814.auz"" both on my desktop.

did 'show package contents of ""LivePatch""
->opened 'content'->MacOS->found ""LivePatch""

im lost after that. thanks.

,jimFR,2012-01-19T23:51Z,"Nice torrent!
what worked for me:
1. open and unpack download  (SUITE814)
2. open ableton_suite_814_program_only.dmg
3. copy live 8.1.4 OS X to applications
4. copy Authorize814.auz to live 8.1.4 OS X folder
5. open Live by dragging Authorize814.auz on to it. now is will open
6. Live will open and will say your authorization is completed

sorry for my bad English 
goodluck"
