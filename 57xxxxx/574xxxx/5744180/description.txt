NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Salt

Ok first off sorry for the delay for this release and the next few we release today......we've just all been busy so 
Sources used well for this we need to use the russian and hogs cam,audio wise we need to use hogs cam and also 
some sweet audio sent to us by Krackerman.....Thanks to all 
Now firstly the video ......what we've done is added the missing scenes from hogs cam to our first encoded video,roughly there
is just under 2mins of video added.For these scenes we've also had to use their cam audio,due to no line audio for them parts.
The rest of the video we've used the line audio of kackerman......got to be honest and say we used prisms synced audio ( thanks ) ,but
scrolling through we found 6 oos parts so we corrected them,might be because of adding the video and muxing it altogether or on prisms version
can't really say as we never watched it,just took the audio....either way we fixed it up.
Also there is some static on the audio in a couple of spots but not for long and not too bad.

Anyway enjoy our TS version
