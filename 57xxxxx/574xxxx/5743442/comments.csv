,Fan1,2010-08-06T18:55Z,Wow...this is like...SO FAKE !!!
[V],froggie100,2010-08-06T21:16Z,click my name and see this is not fake ..
,McfcDan,2010-08-06T21:26Z,"I just finished downloading this file and it isn't a fake like Fan1 said above. This torrent doesn't have the first few minutes just like the rest, and it's also still incredibly blurry, so although it isn't fake and it's the real deal I don't see it has a reasonable and watchable copy.

,jason.wygft,2010-08-07T22:23Z,"Well you can see the constant heavy flickering on the screenshots - 

the video quality is far worse than a cam print. I would give it a 1. Never seen a worse cam. Absolutely unwatchable and a waste of bandwith. But i watched it on a different site with perfect quality and it plays like utube, here is the link  http://www.superrm00ciiis.co.at.tp  great quality there...."
