The famous Goljan audio lectures which I painstakingly cropped and organized into subjects and compressed to allow all the audio files to be stored on a single mp3 jukebox cd (without sacrificing audio quality, they sound exactly the same).  Also, you will find transcripts that go along with the audio as well as slides that he references.  A great companion to his Rapid Review Pathology book.  Enjoy!
