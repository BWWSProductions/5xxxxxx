- JÃ¸rn - Stand Up And Shout (Dio)
I really like JÃ¸rn well, but this one is a little bit too generic. This, combined with a much too long useless guitar solo. Check out their gems on #116 Perfect Strangers and on #367 I walk alone! -- Xe-NONE - Eins Zwei Polizei (Mo-Do)
Letâ€™s talk aesthetics first. In all my years on this planet the dance metal band Xe-NONE from Russia /w SINGER CHICK/CHICK SINGER are the only band where some GUY and his anti-graviational rastas totally steal the chickâ€™s show! 
Their style is very catchy (but not in a Western mallcore-borderline-hiphop-way) as they tend to mix C64/Amiga-sounds into their fast-paced mildly-metal-touched songs. By covering Mo-Do (an ITALIAN one hit wonder albeit he sings in German) Xe-NONE easily achieves a new level of obnoxiousness. This is quite an astonishing development, after theyâ€™re guilty of covering Aqua (sic!) and E-Roticâ€™s â€œMax donâ€™tâ€™ have sex with your exâ€ (sic-ker!) beforeâ€¦

+ Feel - Sweet Harmony (The Beloved)
Did you ever pour too much sugar into your coffee and wished you could turn back time to the moment where you reached the point of â€œenough sugarâ€? Original Sweet Harmony is just like a coffee with a ton of sugar in itâ€¦ itâ€™s too fucking sweet, I just canâ€™t stomach that kind of saccharine bliss!
In comes Feel to save the day! Although this is no great cover by any means, they make your coffee enjoyable again!

- The Wildhearts - Waiting Room (Fugazi)

- Bliix - Until I Die (September)
Meaningless pop happiness enters one ear and leaves the other without any processing whatsoeverâ€¦ I feel nothing and I think nothing because of it. Strike that, Iâ€™m getting angry. I want to kill people, go on a rampage, shoot at nice things and put sharp things into cute thingsâ€¦
There you have it, Bliix! This is how your drivel makes me feel! All of it!

- Hypnogaja - Here Comes The Rain Again (Eurythmics)
This mess can be broken up into different phases (just like a virus pandemic or a nuclear explosion). Put on your safety goggles and witness the analysis:
a) Hypnogaya lives up to its name by playing some instrumental guitar intro. Well done! This sure wins over chicks w/o taste!
b) Notice the whiny winching. This helps a) â€¦a lot.
c) [01:16] The most ridiculous mallcore/Evanescence break in recent history (i.e. the last 5 minutes).
d) [01:30] Just tell me he isnâ€™t trying to sing like James Hetfield, just tell me he isnâ€™t doing that on purpose!
e) [02:30] Violins = sentimental, get it?
f) [03:33] Witness total voice breakdown. Seriously, how does that Hypergaja posse ever want to play a full concertâ€™s set if their singerâ€™s voice breaks after 3 fucking minutes?
(Basket) case closed.

- Ultimatum - Metal Health (Quiet Riot)
Metal Health is as simple (and stupid) as metal gets. This cover is soo far off the track to that reptilian brain groove the original possesses I canâ€™t even find wordsâ€¦

+ Phoenix Rizing - Roses Are Red (Aqua)
What is it with Power Metal bands and Aqua? While Phoenix Rizing are successful at pulling the nausea off the original Aqua mess, this cover is a little bit too tame to be called metal. Also the nonsensical lyrics (that is if you want to call endless repetitions of â€œdam-di-da-daâ€ lyricsâ€¦) really shows in this over-stretched coverâ€¦ there just isnâ€™t enough substance to carry my spark of interest for over 6 minutesâ€¦

- Impulsia - Layla (Eric Clapton)
Everybody knows (and loves) the famous riff; this coverâ€™s problem zone lies everywhere else. While they pull off the trademark stuff nicely, they just donâ€™t show any of their own ideas outside of it.

- Chiodos - Flagpole Sitta (Harvey Danger)
Is this a woman or a man singing? How many schoolchildren were forced to take part? And what genius came up with the idea to end in growling this happy-hippy-go-lucky mess of a song?

~~~Explanation of ratings~~~
++ = Now we dance! Outstanding creativity and arrangements which easily topple the original.
+ = Good for getting in the mood. Keep it!
- = Song has that special nothing. In "
