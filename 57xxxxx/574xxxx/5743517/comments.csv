A lot of releases have really bad encoding settings, such as unnessarily using ref>5 (breaking dxva compatiblity with minimal to no quality gain), or level 4.1 (if you look at the max bitrate, they are in fact level 3.1 compliant, just the wrong header), etc"
,ollienightly,2010-08-09T13:07Z,"Ok. It's ref=12. Another waste of time.
What a shame as it's otherwise quite good!

Why not set ref=4 or 5 and lose maybe less than 0.5% of quality and get Level 3.1 compliance not to mention faster encoding.

If you want quality that bad why not set subme=8, which should be more than enough to compensate the quality loss, if any exists that is."
