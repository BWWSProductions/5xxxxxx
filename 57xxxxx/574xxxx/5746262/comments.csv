[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-08T03:03Z,"@ TKOG11 - Yes, I can upload more stand-up. I also love stand-up. 

BTW I am uploading Entourage S01 to the seedbox now expect to see it in the next 16-20 hours as I plan on uploading several other things in the next 24 hours. (^_^)

Upcoming stand-up releases are - 
- Steve Byrne The Byrne Identity
- Dane Cook Isolated Incident 
- Robin Williams - Live On Broadway"
,TKOG11,2010-08-08T03:10Z,"Yes, i saw your post on your last upload, and thanked you for the update, but i guess i can thank you again. Also, i've seen the dane cook one, and it is pretty funny."
,Lovejam,2010-08-08T16:17Z,"How bout the next ones without the censoring. Beep, beep, bbeep, beep beeeeeeeep."
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-08T17:19Z,@ Lovejam - I will do my best to get uncensored versions.
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-08T23:09Z,"Would anybody like me to upload The IT Crowd Seasons 1-3?     
UK comedy series about two I.T. nerds and their clueless female manager, who work in the basement of a very successful company. When they are called on for help, they are never treated with any respect at all. "
,Lovejam,2010-08-09T05:49Z,"You are cool in my book.
There are already a lot of ""The IT Crowd"" all 4 seasons uploaded. Not in iPod format though.
It probably wouldnt take too long though since there are only 6 episodes per season.
Whatever you decide, thanks for all of your quality uploads."
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-10T01:35Z,"@ Lovejam - You are right, it wouldn't take much time, seeing as how I already had S01 done and just did S02.
