,stolman,2010-08-10T11:53Z,"mate its unreal what youre able to do quality wise with such a small file. are you aware of any other uploaders beside yourself that are doing a similar thing with small mkv files. i have downloaded from you, yify, and pluto"
[V],MKVGuy,2010-08-10T20:15Z,"@dj4movies, thanks for your comment and help, I use a small and cheap seedbox, will ask for help in future if required..

@faizaan, they are muxed, they aren't harcoded, you can disable them from any Media Player if you are not interested in them, I started muxing(soft-coding) them to use the max utilization of .MKV container..

@sreeja, are you talking about The Departed (2006)? Sybil is on its way..

@stolman, there's whole good list, I forgot where I saw that, it was in one of the small rip uploader's account, maybe some1 from the downloaders wants to present their list of uploaders like me, I have no issue to see their URLs in my torrents.."
,wira020,2010-08-23T20:39Z,"Thank you so much for uploading this... it's a very very good movie... tears will fall watching this... I know it's very unreal to have so many accidents and stuff, but it's very2 good acting and believable... all the actor and actress are very good... even the guy in coma did his part very well... please watch this!!

Audio n video is perfect... thanks MKVguy!!"
