The Secret World allows listeners to eavesdrop on the bizarre, surprising and very secret lives of public people who have been caught unaware by the microphone. You could say it's an impressionable comedy starring Jon Culshaw, although you probably shouldn't.

Parallel stories unfold from morning until night as the great and good become embroiled in the most unlikely situations. Although not topical or political, The Secret World is a surreal twist on the familiar "impression show" without parody, pastiche or the usual caricaturising.

www.comedy.org.uk Review: [quote]This series is basically a less-topical, more subdued version of Dead Ringers. The slow pace allows for some surreal scenes to be built up (for example, Gordon Brown conducting a meeting in his bathroom).

The Secret World delivers some great ideas, un-expected characterisations (Bruce Forsyth as a gangster!), and a number of rather good subtle jokes. We really, really enjoyed the first series and are now looking forward to the second series.[/quote]
