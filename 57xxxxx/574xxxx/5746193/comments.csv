,badboy420,2010-08-15T10:20Z,"The default installation is in English.

Game requires some 10-13 gb during extraction and finally after the extraction it takes 9.30 gb.

It worked great.Yet to play the game fully"
,badboy420,2010-08-15T10:28Z,"@kratos_93

once u add the singularity_es.reg file to ur registry it kind of stays in the registry forever, unless u manually remove it.

Even if u reinstall the game, the data is bound to stay there.
For those who accidentally install another language

1)open regedit
2)browse to the following ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Activision\Singularity""
3)Delete the lines
""GameLanguage""=dword:00000004
""Language""=""1034""
""LanguageCode""=""ESP""

4)leave other data intact.
5)restart ur PC, run the game.
U ll get it back in English"

[T],bulletzz74,2010-11-01T08:42Z,"@Yaxir 
Unpacking takes some time, i recommend you to defrag your pc and yes maybe its because you have 512 mb of ram...
