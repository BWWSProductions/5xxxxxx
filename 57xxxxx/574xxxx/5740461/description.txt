Renowned guitarist Gary Moore devoted much of his early career to playing metal-tinged hard rock, first as a member of 1970s bands Skid Row, Thin Lizzy, and Colosseum II, and then as a solo artist throughout the 1980s. But in the 1990s, Moore reembraced the influences of Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, and Peter Green for a return to his first love, the blues. This concert captures the revamped Moore and his backing band The Midnight Blues at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1990, performing tracks from that year's STILL GOT THE BLUES that includes "Walking by Myself," "All Your Love," "Cold Cold Feeling," and many more.
