Desc: In the Year of the City 2274, humans live in a
vast, bubbled metropolis, where computerized 
servo-mechanisms provide all needs so everyone can
pursue endless hedonism. Endless, that is, until 
Lastday when anyone who's 30 must submit to Carousel,
a soaring, spinning trip to eternity and supposed
rebirth. The screen's first use of laser holography 
highlights this post-apocalyptic winner of a Special
Acheivement Award for Visual Effects. Michael York 
plays Logan 5, a Sandman authorized to terminate 
Runners fleeing Carousel. Logan is almost 30. Catch
him if you can.
