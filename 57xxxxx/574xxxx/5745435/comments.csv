,dafmat71,2010-08-08T23:09Z,no stress ive put the patch in the zip!!
,dafmat71,2010-08-09T17:18Z,"if you're seeder, and have no limit internet, stay in your position and share, cause im limited( only 40 Go per month!!) and so, i cant upload non-stop!! ;-)"
,AK47Adrian,2010-08-09T19:19Z,hmm okey ;)
,biffbaffler,2010-08-12T00:40Z,"Dun't work mate - .NET Framewaor 2 fails to install which then fcuks up the rest of the 200 update. I managed to get round this by continuing with the rest of the 2008 update installe, rebooting, then installing .net framework afterwards - then reboot once more. Having said all that, it's not worth it - still more bugs than a windscreen in Summer & not really any better than the Longhorn reloaded patch. Move onto a better life with Windows 7 & a Longhorn theme - they are out there if you search... "
,dafmat71,2010-08-12T18:13Z,"@biffbaffler: go to joejoe http://www.joejoe.org/forum/index to find some details about the fails!!
but in general, im ok with you, but its a beta!! Its just for test it!! And for collection!!! Of course i use w7 with a lh theme too!! ;-)"
