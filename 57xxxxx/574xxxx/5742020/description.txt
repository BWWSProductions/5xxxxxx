Man VS Idiocy (MVI) follows the journey of "survival idiot" Collin Williams as he goes deep into the Ochoco Forest of central Oregon. The purpose - to show you what (not) to do if you end up stranded in the wilderness.
 
Man VS idiocy is a Mockumentary combining the styles of both Man VS Wild and Survivorman. It was scouted and shot over a 7 day period by Collin Williams who spent all nights and days alone out in the forest miles from civilization. Tools on hand for survival were minimal with just a multi-tool, magnesium fire starter, two 32 oz bottles, and 1 packet of top ramen available for the entire 7 days.

 

Man VS Idiocy was also solely produced and funded by Collin. If you enjoyed MVI please donate (see donate page) and help fund MVI 2. 100% of all donation go directly to funding future MVI's
