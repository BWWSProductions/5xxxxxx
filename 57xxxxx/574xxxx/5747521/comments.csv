The same goes for Star Trek TNG, Voyager and DS9. Norell, stretching an SD file to 720p resolution doesn't make it an HD file."
,Norell_xD,2010-08-09T22:49Z,"Yes, this is a fake HD )) but its better than 720x400 ;)"
,Agrippa,2010-10-15T10:40Z,Will you release the remaining B5 series too Norell_xD?
,Norell_xD,2011-01-18T17:54Z,"I promise. The third hi-res season is now completed, for this moment without subs yet.
