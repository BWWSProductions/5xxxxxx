[T],trialNerror,2011-09-04T19:51Z,"@bboy2: To remove extra audio tracks use mkvmerge GUI.  It's freeware, just search the web and you'll find downloads for it all over the place (videohelp.com is the best place to get stuff like that).  

Drag and drop the MKV video into the running program, uncheck the unwanted audio/subtitle tracks, and start muxing.

@starfight12:  With a video bitrate of 7,450 Kbps the quality is freakin awesome!

@Ziolo18:  THANK YOU!!!"
