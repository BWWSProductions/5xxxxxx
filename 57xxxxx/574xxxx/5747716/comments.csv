peace"
,desertTPB,2010-08-08T23:55Z,"just downloaded sample and check quality. its real deal buddies, this is a TS and perfect quality for a TS. worth download which i am doing that :) thanks to uploader."
,waistland,2010-08-08T23:55Z,I know n3llo this was the site to get feedback now the bay is going to crap! I use rarbg more now since they put more info about the torrents and have screen caps for all most every thing.
,waistland,2010-08-09T00:03Z,"The bay needs to catch up to other sites or just close down. This site is always having problems and is off line a lot, no integrated photos instead they add a chat room with fools instead of updating there site to make it more user friendly!"
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-08-09T00:17Z,Someone upload a screen shot or more A/V ratings please. I'll do so when I'm done downloading.
,wilywondr,2010-08-09T01:08Z,"IMO, a sample will tell you more about the quality than any screenshots ever will.
Thanks for the upload."
,partiallove,2010-08-09T01:49Z,Its Cam.....
,Spitven0m,2010-08-09T03:38Z,@waistland i know what you mean how dare uploaders not give us screens and piratebay go offline every now and then because how else will i download or know the quality of my FREE downloads.
,n3llo,2010-08-09T10:53Z,"thanx ppl, i do trust TvTeam but he/she needs to add more info i.e run time or his/her opinion on A/V quality and maybe some screens just for a heads up because not all of us want to waste bandwidth on some shite video file.
@Spitven0m we do appreciate the ""FREE"" downloads but waistland is correct, TPB does go offline now and again (not that it bothers me personally), but the likes of torrentday or demonoid always have screen shots and other info and they also use a must seed policy or your membership gets terminated which is very good in my opinion.
peace all."

,shiningwiz,2010-09-04T09:12Z,"The cam shakes a lot, and the video seems to be sped up in places. I don't know how. Fact is, the video quality is actually quite decent (not your high contrast/brightness etc. like the Prism version) but the fact is, the Prism version is still the best TS rip out there so far. Just download the ""V2"" TS by Prism.

I wonder when a DVD Screener or R5 rip will release."
,dixiedoc,2010-09-18T17:50Z,downloaded the sample looks good downloading the rest thanks again to the tvteam
,joemcdsnr,2010-09-19T06:13Z,thanks
,CarolR,2010-10-17T08:52Z,"I don't expect the uploader to give me detailed info. Some uploaders are busy uploading to give us free stuff.
Besides I've seen too many uploaders claim its a good copy when it's crap. 
As for TPB shutting down... this is the only site where you can look at a listing and immediately tell whether or not you could be getting a fake file. So long as uploaders, like TVTeam, are given the skull and crossbones, I know I'm not getting a virus. I used to go to BTJ, but that's gone to hell with too many ""annonymous"" uploaders.
It's up to the uploader to present us with the file, it is up to the DL'er to tell the others that follow, the quality."
