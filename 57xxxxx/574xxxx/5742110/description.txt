Halsey's Typhoons: Peril on the Sea.

In December 1944, Admiral "Bull" Halsey's Third Fleet was confronted by a killer typhoon in the South Pacific. Despite the courage of the "tin can" sailors battling 100-mile-an-hour winds and torrential rain, three destroyers capsized. Unbelievably, six months later, the Fleet encountered another typhoon. We investigate these intrepid forces of nature that nearly sunk Halsey's career when an official court of inquiry recommended that he be relieved of his duties.
