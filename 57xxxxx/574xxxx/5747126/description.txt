Clare Balding presents coverage as the two major forces of rugby league in recent years come face to face to earn a place in the Challenge Cup final at Wembley.

Despite their dominance of the Super League, Leeds Rhinos have a dismal record in the Challenge Cup. They last contested a final in 2005 and the last time they actually lifted the trophy was way back in 1999.

St Helens, on the other hand, won the trophy three times in succession from 2006 to 2008 before they surrendered their crown to Warrington last year. The match is played at Huddersfield's Galpharm Stadium.
