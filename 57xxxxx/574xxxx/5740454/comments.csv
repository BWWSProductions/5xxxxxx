,omegafox84,2010-08-07T02:12Z,lol. it did look quite bad from the trailer. not too big a fan of the games either. i'm gonna pass on this one. thanks anyways sailo!
,HaremScarem1990,2010-08-07T12:55Z,I'm going to see it just because Gary Daniels is in it. I saw Bloodmoon (1997) and it's a pretty bad ass movie. Acting sucks but the action is awesome. Too bad nobody ever uploads dvdr's of lesser known movies like this one.
