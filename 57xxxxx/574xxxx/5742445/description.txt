Megadeth / Killing Is My Business... And Business Is Good!

This is the original release, with a completely uncensored version of 'These Boots'. This is ripped from the first issue CD, not the remaster, so you probably expect what quality these will be.

These were all ripped by me using CDex/Lame/320kbps.

01 - Last Rites... Loved to Deth
02 - Killing Is My Business... And Business Is Good
03 - Skull Beneath The Skin
04 - These Boots
05 - Rattlehead
06 - Chosen Ones
07 - Looking Down The Cross
08 - Mechanix

Megadeth Trivia: Most Megadeth fans know that Mechanix is Dave Mustaine's take on Metallica's Four Horsemen, which he was obviously involved with. But did you know that track #6 on this CD (Chosen Ones) refers to Monty Python and the Holy Grail? Specifically the scene with the rabbit.
