,AlexSupertrampOriginal,2011-05-17T09:43Z,"@goodterling: nice! Check out ""Game of Thrones"". Titties galore~! Thanks to HBO. Just starting to download ""Luther"". Does the BBC allow tits?"

""Titular character"" means means the character from the tital.  I hope you guessed that.

I've seen tits on the BBC before (not often) but when it comes to crime shows like this they're usually on the bodies the victims."

If your wondering they allow cock and pussy too. I think its more about being tasteful.
I believe stuff like torture and other ""shocking"" stuff is allowed."
