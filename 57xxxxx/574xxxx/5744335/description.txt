Copy the content (4 files) of the folder Pro Apps 2010 to:

Volume/Library/Application Support/ProApps


overwrite any existing files, so all apple applications have now a volume licence

Warning: I suggest to backup your existing License files, before you replace!
I'm not sure, if EVERY Pro App is new licensed with this file.

I only tested it with Logic 9.1 & Final Cut Pro 7.x Soundtrack Pro 3.x
