Torrents rely on seeds, without seeds torrents would die...... if I didn't seed it first you wouldn't have this program. Share the love!

Also comments telling other users if it worked or not would be great. Don't you hate it when you download something and it turns out to be a pile of crap.

,thesinger313,2010-08-08T11:04Z,"Melodyne is the ONLY software able to break up a polyphonic piece of audio and allow you to manipulate each note. essentially allowing you to tune a guitar loop after its been recorded, or change a major chord into a minor. Google ""melodyne DNA"" "

,gruppidy,2010-08-16T15:07Z,"It installed alright. Haven't used it or anything, but it looks okay. Anyone know if I can insert this into a DAW? I wanted to try this out before buying and the demo really sucks! "

""The folder “Melodyne editor” can’t be opened because you don’t have permission to see its contents.""

how do i fix this?"
,devinm666,2010-12-13T19:03Z,never mind...changed the folder attributes; for some reason it was set to deny access to everyone
,brn002,2011-01-11T16:15Z,"*** Its asking for the Username, serial number, and license key.... Did i do something wrong? "
,Tomi77777,2011-02-19T00:44Z,"well, that is something man!!!!!!!!"
,Nivekz,2011-03-03T02:46Z,"Could someone PLEASE help me with the serial number?
When I launch it as a standalone it's fine, but when I launch it as a plug-in in my DAW it asks me for a serial number. What could it be?
It does accept numbers such as ""1"" and ""8"" for some reason. 
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help me out here!"

,alsim7,2011-05-11T03:23Z,"It seem to work incredibly with Logic..but how can you work it as a stand alone if you can not open the the main file in applications?? Did try to open via an audio file trying to pen with Melodyne, but no access...any clue?? cheers!"
,Vignale1,2011-05-16T15:12Z,"Standalone work, but in Cubase 5 it's in the list of inserts, but when I add it and click on the ""E"" for edit, the HUI of Melodyne doesn't show up and nothing happens; Am I doing something wrong?
Can someone please help? I play a lot out of tune! ;-)"
,upMONSTERdown,2011-06-08T05:32Z,"this torrent works great, includes every version you need to work with what ever DAW you are using. Of course now that I know I like it I'm going to go buy it."

,misconception77,2011-09-06T04:57Z,"I have been wanting to use this for a long time and i was so excited! installed opened up logic
and NOTHING THERE. no celomony plugins????? 
what do i need to do to use this in LOGIC.??????? im baffled. and drooling."
,yiannisr,2011-11-03T18:55Z,"please, how can I make it work as logic pro plugin,
 there is nothing there. Also the record button does not work"
,rufio1945,2011-11-15T09:59Z,"when inserted into Logic as a plug in, it opens up but says it can ONLY be used in ""playback mode"" no editing allowed. It then takes you to the celemony web page and asks for a license key to update. 

thesinger313 - can you clarify? otherwise this is a bullshit waste of time torrent!!!!!"
,rufio1945,2011-11-15T10:14Z,"problem solved, Just make sure that you're not connected to the internet when you install otherwise on opening the plug in for the first time it will ask you for a license key to update."
,itzSMOKE,2012-02-10T06:10Z,"its working for me .. and im runnin Lion 10.7.2

downladed.. opened .. installed .. easy .. thanks "
,kanel0728,2012-02-25T00:49Z,"Hey guys, I'm running Snow Leopard. I installed Logic Pro and everything works fine with that. I installed the torrent and when I go into Logic or GarageBand, and open Melodyne, it says it is not authorized. I looked up some serials, and none of them are complete serials. How an I get it to all work without needing the serial? My fried did it with Logic and was running Snow Leopard and it worked perfectly fine for him. No problems at all. He can open Melodyne in Logic Pro and it doesn't request a serial or verification of any kind. He installed the exact same torrent of Melodyne and installed the exact same Logic Pro torrent also. What am I doing wrong? I tried installing it without the internet on ad that still didn't work."
