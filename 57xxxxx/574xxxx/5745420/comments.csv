If you have a problem, at least comment and I'll try and help you out.

Because of this idiocy, this is the last release and crack I will do for ThePirateBay."
,chrfak31,2010-08-10T10:30Z,"DON'T DOWNLOAD, IT'S FULL OF VIRUS AND WORMS AND ALL THAT SHIT! FUCKING DOUCHBAG jaymac407!"
,jaymac407,2010-08-11T00:55Z,"Look at my other torrents, I've never put a virus on any of them... :/"
,Rebellian_,2010-08-11T08:32Z,noob the patch and the keygen is often confused as virus trojan and worms use it in a sandboxie to see if you have a real promblem this is the same crack that everybody uses for superantispyware so either you download it or fuck off

,Blade10X,2010-08-24T02:14Z,"Thanks man! But, but, but... Please be careful about what you put in your torrents because file ""Patcher"" is some kind of security threat. It's not a virus literally speaking, it is kind of other malware type similar to e.g RAT (Remote Administration Tool). This threat in your torrent is on medium risk level. So please watch out!!!"
,Phantom4444,2010-08-27T12:10Z,"Clean and working.
Scanned with SUPERAntiSpyware and Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware with no threats found.
Thanks!

@jaymac407: Please continue uploading your new releases to TPB! I really look forward to the next one."
,hello40204,2010-10-20T13:37Z,"comments from chrfack31 is a fake . because this is comming from  a guy who works for the company and obviously does not want you to put this upload here . jaymac407. continue the good work . you should know that the rating comes from assiociations against pirating. so they will put a lower rate to try you to stop.
so keep up the good work"
,yiannix,2010-10-20T14:03Z,"Hey jaymac407, 
I have a problem with the the patcher, it doesn't seem to work, give me an error saying ""Patching failed....etc""
Running Windows 7 64 bit. What could be the problem?
P.s Disregard idiots, they obviously don't have the slightest idea about antivirus and false positives ;)"
,jany87,2010-11-18T13:11Z,"If you get ""Patching Failed.."" on Windows 7, and probably Vista also...
You should ""execute as administrator""
worked for me
grtz"
