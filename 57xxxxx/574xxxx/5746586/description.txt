    When two young couples venture into the desert  
    for a sexy photo shoot, fun in the sun quickly  
    turns into disaster after their car crashes into  
    a ravine. Left with little water and without shelter,  
    the couples are forced to ration supplies. As tensions  
    rise, so does the heat in the isolated desert. Dehydrated,  
    lost and hopeless, one by one the group begins to fall victim  
    to the relentless elements. Miles away from civilization,  
    suffering from delirium and dying of thirst, will anyone  
    make it out alive?
