Audio kinda weak.. at loud volume it'll shriek... kinda hurts my ears... Max bit rate for audio is only 53.6kbps, maybe it's starved of bandwidth.. 

All in all, perfectly watchable and hearable ( just doesnt sound so good)... Thanks for the ups.."

@All New Guys
Please keep the torrents on, do not remove them after you are finished with download. Keep Ratio above 1:1. And dont worry your ISP donot charge you for the uploads. So help Others. sharing is Caring. God Bless "
