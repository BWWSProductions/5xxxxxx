STORY
Elsa and Clive, two young rebellious scientists, defy legal and ethical
boundaries and forge ahead with a dangerous experiment: splicing together human
and animal DNA to create a new organism. Named "Dren", the creature rapidly
develops from a deformed female infant into a beautiful but dangerous winged
human-chimera, who forges a bond with both of her creators - only to have that
bond turn deadly.
