The Alex Jones Show
Sunday, 08 August 2010


[sebaygo1]



The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.


The Infowars web site describes today's show:

Elena Kagan has been sworn in, airport body scanners take center stage in national politicial debate, Fidel Castro gave a stern nuclear warning, Billionairs are signing agreements to donate half of their fortunes, and more. Alex also covers the latest news and takes your calls.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
