I merely put them all together, reduced the bitrate to 521Kbps total, (64Kbps for the audio) and converted them to 320x240 resolution. (for use on portable devices, like MP4 players, iPods, and some cell phones)

This compilation is in WMV format. Convert it if you want, but I’m not going to spend another 8+ hours reconverting 3 ½ hours of video.


All credit goes to Ross Scott, creator of Freeman’s Mind. I hope he won’t mind my upload…"
