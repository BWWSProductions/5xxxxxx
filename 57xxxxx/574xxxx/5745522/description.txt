This is a high quality, full resolution, high profile h264 dvd rip of Star Trek Deep Space 9 - Season 2.  These files may be a little large for some.  But if you aren't worried about space, and want a higher quality, then this is for you.  If you enjoyed my Next Generation rips, then you'll enjoy these as well.  The quality is even better since the quality of these original dvd's is better.  I've previewed the episodes and they look and sound great on my 50 inch lcd/surround sound system.
