In Flash Professional CS5 Essential Training, author Todd Perkins explains the fundamentals of Flash Professional CS5, the industry standard for creating animations and interactive applications for the web, desktop, and mobile devices. This course starts with the basics, such as using the drawing tools to create simple animations, and progresses to automating animation with tweens and adding interactivity with ActionScript. This course also covers how to add sound and video to projects, enhance realism with effects like easing, and publish a project to a variety of platforms. Exercise files are included.
Topics include:

    * Becoming familiar with the Flash workspace
    * Drawing basic shapes
    * Masking content
    * Organizing a file into layers
    * Importing content into the Library
    * Understanding symbols and instances
    * Inserting frames and keyframes in the Timeline
    * Animating with motion and shape tweens
    * Creating IK (Inverse Kinematics) animations
    * Using ActionScript code snippets to control video playback
    * Publishing HTML, SWF, and AIR files from Flash

Not my favorite trainer by any stretch of the term (annoying voice) but this is a very in depth and extensive course. It is an ISO of the GUI version of this release. 
Just extract or mount to a virtual drive with your favorite flavor of image software (I prefer PowerISO)and run. 
Happy learning!
