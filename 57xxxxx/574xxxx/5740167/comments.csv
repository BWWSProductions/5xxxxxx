,DragonRider65,2011-06-17T04:31Z,"That is too wierd. You have to use the magnet link to get this download. I don't like doing that; think I will pass on this one. I would suggest re-uploading this torrent, man, so we can share your torrent with other people; I know two other people who would like to share info with you and everyone else here on TPB, but they will not download the magnet link instead of a torrent either."

,BerkeleyGuy1,2011-08-17T08:30Z,"Howdy, there is a very easy way to get the torrent file from just knowing the magnet link.

(1) Copy the magnet link address and look for the hash number.  In the case for this particular one the hash address is:
magnet:?xt=urn:btih:71791593bb62d0f9c0da891794e577beb37a8d37&dn=Lynda.com-Flash+Professional+CS5%3A+Essential+Training+%2AGUI+versio&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.publicbt.com%3A80&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.ccc.de%3A80

For this case the Hash # is the 40 digit Hex value string: 71791593bb62d0f9c0da891794e577beb37a8d37
"
,BerkeleyGuy1,2011-08-17T08:33Z,"
(2) Now you can use the format provided by the nice folks at Torrage.net to take the Hash value and get the torrent file. "
,BerkeleyGuy1,2011-08-17T08:40Z,"

torrage[dòt]com[slàsh]torrent[slàsh]71791593bb62d0f9c0da891794e577beb37a8d37[dòt]torrent

(3) Copy and paste the above URL and then save the torrent file.  That's it folks!

I wish more folks knew about Torrage[dòt]com.  They provide a great service!  As long as you know the Hash number for any torrent you can get the torrent file.

Godspeed TPB.
