Metric are a band who have embraced an eclectic and adventurous outlook -- the group's music encompasses elements of synth pop, new wave, dance rock, and electronic, while the group has collectively been based in Toronto, Montreal, New York, Los Angeles, and London over the course of their existence.  In the fall of 2003, the Canadian independent label Everloving Records released Metric's second album, Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?. The album (later picked up by Last Gang Records) was a major critical and commercial success, especially in Canada.
