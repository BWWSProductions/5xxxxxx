,Shotobuke,2010-08-23T00:27Z,Do not waste your time folks. This is not the new remastered version due out soon. This is a very grainy upscaled version that also contains an HDNet logo overlayed in the corner for the duration of the entire movie.

Wow, so the ""HDTV"" in the name wasn't a hint for you that this has been capped from TV?"
