Release Info

Pukkelpop continues to be the quintessential music festival!
Discovering new bands, watching established acts excel, witnessing
legendary reunions: that is what Pukkelpop is all about.
We have our eyes on the future, but now and then we also like to look
back and see where we came from. Our line-up demonstrates this every
year and so does the first official Pukkelpop 25 compilation box!
This extraordinary box with no less than four CDs and 80 artists will
take you on a musical journey through the history of Pukkelpop. From
fresh faces such as La Roux, Florence + The Machine to lovely ladies
such as PJ Harvey and Roisin Murphy. The Chemical Brothers, The
Prodigy, DJ Shadow, Orbital paved the way for The Bloody Beetroots,
Hot Chip and LCD Soundsystem. Then there is all the beauty that is
Eels, Sparklehorse, Elbow, Elliott Smith, Morphine and The National.
And lets not forget genuine Pukkelpop acts such as Nick Cave & the
Bad Seeds, Pixies, Sonic Youth, dEUS, Big Black and Ramones. You can
find them all on this amazing four-CD box.

25 Years Pukkelpop

The year is 1985. Boys Noize turned three years old. Bloc Party's
Kele blew out four candles. Selah Sue, Uffie and Ellie Goulding were
not even born yet.

That same year a few young people from the town of Leopoldsburg in
Limburg came up with the idea to organize a music festival. This
marked the birth of Pukkelpop, which took place for the very first
time on a football field in Heppen. Front 242 and Anne Clark
headlined, attracting 3.000 visitors. Pukkelpop was an instant
success.

A quarter of a century later, Pukkelpop is more popular and alive
than ever before: for the first time there will be a ‘SOLD OUT’ sign
at the festival gates. After 25 editions the same ‘young people’ from
back then still run the show, together with some fresh blood added
over the years. Thousands of visitors have experienced wonderful
moments standing in front of the various Pukkelpop stages: they
witnessed the rise of grunge music, moved to the beats of dance
artists for the first time, pogo danced their hearts out at the skate
stage or made a unique discovery at one of the smaller stages. Also
add camping, making friends, laughing, dancing, ... to the mix, all
in that typical casual Pukkelpop atmosphere.
