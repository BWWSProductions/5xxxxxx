In the year 10191, the Houses Atreides and Harkonnen are fighting a
bloody battle for control of the barren desert planet Arrakis, also
known as Dune. Jessica, the Dukes concubine, and Paul, his son and
heir to the throne, are the only members of the Atreides family who
survived the massacre organized by Baron Harkonnen, with the covert
assistance of the ruling Emperor.

During the two years you will spend among the Fremen as Paul, you
must earn their trust and demonstrate your strength and courage in
