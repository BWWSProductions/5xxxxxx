2008 Nomadness [Bonus Tracks], [Remastered]    CD  A&M 5302822 

10th album by the legendary UK Folk-Rock group Strawbs led by Dave Cousins, who is still in the helm 40 years later enjoying the renewed interest in the band, Strawbs were definitely one of the most successful and brilliant UK Folk-Rock outfits. This album was the last of the albums released by the A&M label and marks a certain attempt to produce music, which is less complex and more accessible. There are no epic tracks here, but the material is very strong, written, as usual, mostly by Cousins, with a couple tracks by other band members. The band at the time of the recording was a quartet, with Cousins, Dave Lambert, Chas Cronk and Rod Coombes, but many famous musician friends participate in the recording, including keyboardists Rick Wakeman and Tommy Eyre. In retrospect this is still an extremely solid release, which makes the fact that it remained unreleased on CD until now a complete folly. High time to grab it now!
