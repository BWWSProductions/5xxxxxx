SUMMARY

The current method of raw food production is largely a
response to the growth of the fast food industry since
the 1950s. The production of food overall has more
drastically changed since that time than the several
thousand years prior. Controlled primarily by a handful
of multinational corporations, the global food
production business - with an emphasis on the business
- has as its unwritten goals production of large
quantities of food at low direct inputs (most often
subsidized) resulting in enormous profits, which in turn
results in greater control of the global supply of food
sources within these few companies. Health and safety
(of the food itself, of the animals produced themselves,
of the workers on the assembly lines, and of the
consumers actually eating the food) are often overlooked
by the companies, and are often overlooked by government
in an effort to provide cheap food regardless of these
negative consequences. Many of the changes are based on
advancements in science and technology, but often have
negative side effects. The answer that the companies
have come up with is to throw more science at the
problems to bandage the issues but not the root causes.
The global food supply may be in crisis with lack of
biodiversity, but can be changed on the demand side of
the equation.
