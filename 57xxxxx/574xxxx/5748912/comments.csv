,MickeyDR,2010-08-09T08:08Z,whats up with the 'No input file specified.' message on all you're torrents? Any one know if its a problem at my end?
,bambicoco,2010-08-09T08:19Z,no- all of the eztv torrents for this tonight have had that message on mine and others as well- havent been able to dl the torrent
,Kali_Flower,2010-08-09T08:41Z,"It isn't just at your end. 
It's not all of eztv's torrents though; just these most recent postings of True Blood S03 Ep08 for me, and I have no idea why...
But then I'm retarded when it comes to this. "
,Kali_Flower,2010-08-09T08:45Z,I dont get it- how are there 194/5565 seeders and leechers if theres a problem opening the torrent file? 30 minutes ago the numbers were lower. 
,Kali_Flower,2010-08-09T08:47Z,"Ooohh ok. Magnet link. Gotcha. 
See? I said I was retarded."
,mattberry,2010-08-09T09:00Z,"Go to his site, it's working fine there."
,EHVNL,2010-08-09T15:12Z,just google the torrent name
,guy_wild,2010-08-09T18:50Z,Use the magnet...
,torrentlars,2010-08-09T19:46Z,Why doesn't True Blood ever work on my  A.C. Ryan Playon HD?? It is supposed to play EVERYTHING. What is so special with these mkv's?
,torrentlars,2010-08-09T19:48Z,fbj
,spacelord76,2010-08-09T22:11Z,"Ok, what's the difference between dl with magnet link and the ""normal"" way? "

,L_Moyse,2010-08-09T23:03Z,"This copy is all over the place. I don't know if the packets were messed up using the magnet link or if it is just a corrupt copy, but it's barely watchable. Trying a different link on eztv site."
,eekstah,2010-08-10T00:43Z,"It tells me the file is already downloading, wich it isn't. I think it's confused with the previous release..."
,lamerbr34,2010-08-11T06:13Z,"kkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
WHAT FUCK IS?????????
ERROR?
??????????????????????????????"
,L_Moyse,2010-08-11T20:19Z,"Having problems with this torrent, try this one.

,theneonraindrop,2010-08-16T20:56Z,"had to use the magnet link on this one, but a great quality up once again by eztv. thanks!"
,Vegasbob,2010-08-22T12:31Z,This Immerse torrent from eztv has some moderate corruption issues. I am getting frame clipping and catchup trying to playback this one and i've never had this problem with any of their torrents before. Forced a recheck of the file in .torrent program and it says all data was downloaded correctly so I must conclude this upload is a bit corrupted...
,mattigan,2010-08-22T21:35Z,"These new IMMERSE rips don't seem to play on Realtec chipset Media players (AC Ryan & Mede8er) don't know what's different now, but they keep coming up as invalid files. Really annoying! 

So beware if you are planning to view these on a media player."
,WeedPirate,2010-09-10T21:35Z,"i dunno whats going on with this one, when i tried to DL it, it started downloading S03E09 instead lol"
