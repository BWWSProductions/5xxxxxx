iPad Tips and Tricks
Author: Christopher Breen

In iPad Tips and Tricks, Mac productivity expert Christopher
Breen provides essential tips and techniques for getting the
most out of the Apple iPad. The course shows how to get
productive on the iPad immediately, with tips for effective
gesturing and typing and for loading it up with content. It
demonstrates how to connect the iPad with the rest of the
world, how to sync documents between the iPad and a desktop
computer or cloud-based services, and how to configure email
and deal with the fact that the iPad has no spam filter. It
demonstrates built-in and third-party solutions for opening
and editing files on the iPad. Finally, it offers tips for
