On a dozen concise sound explorations, altoist Steve Lehman utilizes sequences
and electronic effects to produce otherworldly music. Two of the numbers are
solos, seven are duets with drummer Tyshawn Sorey, and three are quintet
pieces. The music primarily sets brooding moods, sometimes with rhythms,
sometimes not. Few of the pieces are long enough to overstay their welcome (most
end abruptly), but the overall effect is still mostly disturbing and
episodic. Some listeners will find these explorations to be stimulants for
thought, while others will consider them a bit of a bore since they do not
include much development beyond the sounds.
