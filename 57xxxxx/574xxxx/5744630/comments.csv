,blueeyes2112,2010-09-02T15:23Z,"Hope this will answer some questions
I have installed this as upgrade and clean install
On product key screen, do not enter any key numbers (leave blank), uncheck the box for Automatically Activate windows when online.
Click next.
Next box asks Do you want to enter key now, Click no.
it will install vista ultimate.
As it is nearly all up and running, the CMD box appears and fills up with loads of text, then a dialog pops up staing no cd inserted, I clicked continue a few times then it all goes and continues to load windows.
It will do an automatic restart. 
Hey presto you have windows vista ultimate installed and activated with SP2. I have done windows updates and still not had a problem with it. I still got to look round everything, not got Aero working yet.
