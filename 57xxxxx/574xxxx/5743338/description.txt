 Release Notes:

  Yes Internal because track 3 only has "Lame" in his encoder and 
  not like the other 3 tracks "Lame 3.98" so we decided to _INT 
  this before it gets nuked.


 Team Note:

  SOB is here to give you a free quality sample of music and
  to let you discover new artists and new style.
  So if you like a release, buy it as we did.
  We support artists, do the same!

  We are always looking for talented rippers and anything
  which can help us.
  If you think you can bring us something interesting, feel
  free to contact us.
