I couldn't find anyone else that had a Mushishi English dub torrent, so I made this. Helping out my fellow Torrent seekers."

,samboy1983,2010-12-03T15:52Z,"Please Please Please... Will someone seed this, at this rate it'll take days and days to download this and I REALLY want it. Pretty Please :)"
,LordGiruvegan,2010-12-14T09:23Z,"I try to seed this as much as I can, but sometimes I need to go away for a couple days. I also can't seed during the day anymore. I mainly am only to seed from 2 a.m. - 10 a.m. 

I was hoping to have a lot more seeders by now."
,LordGiruvegan,2011-06-14T07:02Z,"Came up fine for me. Not dvd worthy, but ran well on my pc. Take it or leave it."
,MangyHobo,2011-06-15T02:25Z,"Hmm.. could I some how use the audio track from this and video from a better quility one? beacuse I would rather listen and be able to see the show rather then read sub titles the whole time and glance at the artwork..  I use VLC, I just thoght it would be a good idea.."
,MangyHobo,2011-06-15T02:28Z,If it works I will seed this one for a while...  I dont bother seeding torrents with 1000's of seeders for some crappy movie.. but im devoted to seeding on low seed animes that no one would have ever seen if they never used utorrent.. 
,MangyHobo,2011-06-15T02:30Z,I was at 1.9 mb/s last night.. now im at 40 kb/s
,LordGiruvegan,2011-06-17T01:43Z,"Sorry everyone. Since the day before Easter, I haven't been online with my pc. It had the files on there. I'd have to redownload this (which might take forever since not many people seed for long) and seed it again. I have faster upload now though, lol. Pointless though."
,MangyHobo,2011-06-17T23:15Z,Hey Im seeding right now.. I have been for the last cupple days I got like 1.6 GB uploaded...  Unfortunatly it really lags out Mount and Blade.. But I'll leave it seeding for a while..  
,MangyHobo,2011-06-17T23:18Z,Oh hey I just looked in my settings and my upload speed went from 10 kb/s to 1.9 mb/s Enjoy faster seeding :)
,MangyHobo,2011-06-17T23:42Z,"BTW anyone concerned about the quality of this its like good tv quility. The audio sounds a little muted but thats beacuse its english dub.. 
V10/A9"
,LordGiruvegan,2011-06-29T08:56Z,"Thanks for the good review. :D 

I'm gonna re-download this one and seed it again on my new PC. I got this from a few different sites and put them together. If you want to watch other English spoken animes, go to JustDubs.net. They're streamed there, if you like that better."
