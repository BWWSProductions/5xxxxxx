,Xgamer328,2010-08-09T20:40Z,This is not R5 this is lets say CAM dont download this and please dont coment if you dont have watch it
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-08-09T23:35Z,Is this the same shit recycling through like most movies or is this a new source video file? Be specific. No point in downloading the same movie 3 times thinking it's going to be a better version. The one I got was out of sync in the end. So what is this one?
,arzie,2010-08-09T23:44Z,"Its good quality,totally watchable,thanks to uploader !"
,Binks92,2010-08-10T08:48Z,Sample seems fine. Gonna check out the movie and tell back about the quality of the audio and the video.
,hobowithashotgun,2010-08-10T11:14Z,Perfect quality the sound is synced despite what these people say.
,nicolleee,2010-08-10T17:40Z,"This is very wachable....really nice...not dvd rip but worth seeing.
video-8.5
audio-8.5"
,ddfan83,2010-08-16T15:23Z,"This is a decent looking movie. Not a dvdrip by any means but still ok.

Audio is also pretty good and IN SYNC despite what people are saying."
,snilloc,2010-08-25T11:37Z,"For any out of sync problems use GOM Player.  Its free from Google. 
When the movie starts right click and a list of stuff comes up that you can change.  
For sync problems choose AUDIO 
Then SHIFT & < for Backwards, or SHIFT & > Forwards. Then the mouths will sync with the words.
It has never failed to put a movie right for me.
I hope that helps :)"
,TheShadester,2010-08-28T08:45Z,"Great Quality- DVD rip quality. 
A- 9
V- 9
For me the sync was perfect, no problems there.
Gotta say that was one weird movie though, I don't wanna give anything away but some of that stuff near the end.... damn..... that was somewhere I didn't think the movie would go..."
,AidyD,2010-08-30T21:10Z,"Audio is fine and in sync, though the video quality is VHS not DVD."
,leberato2,2010-09-05T04:54Z,if it is out of sync then it can be your player
,AnimostiC_AlieN411,2010-10-22T07:07Z,"decent rip. fast DL.

A:7
