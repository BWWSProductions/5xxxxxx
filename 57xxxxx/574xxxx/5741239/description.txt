Grosse Freiheit Nr. 7 is a 1944 German musical drama film, named after Grosse Freiheit (grand freedom), a street next to Hamburg's Reeperbahn road in the St. Pauli red light district. The film, which features songs like "La Paloma", tells the story of the blond "singing sailor" Hannes KrÃ¶ger (played by Hans Albers) who works in a Reeperbahn club and falls in love with a girl played by Ilse Werner.
