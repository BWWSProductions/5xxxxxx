I'm trying to upgrade from 'Vista: Home Premium' (64x Bit) to this, but each time I try the install it gives me both the ""You can't upgrade from 32x Bit to 64x Bit"" and the ""You can't upgrade from 64x Bit to 32x Bit"" messages, I've tried both options, as well as trying to install it offline and this keeps happening, any suggestions?"
,XHandHeld,2010-08-11T07:55Z, @ masstalixx yes.you have to run it from your desktop

,Jaker_K17,2010-08-11T22:43Z,"I only tried installing it offline once, the rest of the times I was online when I tried...I tried again just to make sure after your comment, but it still came up with the same error. I'm 100% sure I was connected to the internet as I was talking to a friend on MSN at the time, I also tried installing it with absloutely nothing running in the background and nothing is working."
,DJR0D,2010-08-12T04:40Z,"I think im just gonna stay away from this one. Not 1 person has said they tried it an it worked. Im out of DVDs thats why i really wanted to try this way.

,Jaker_K17,2010-08-23T09:15Z,"Nothing? I really need help here. Neither of my computers can burn CDs, so I can't just go download another one (because all the ones I found were burn to disk installs,) I'm on this crappy one because the other one is unbelievably slow, apparently due to Windows Vista and I heard Windows 7 is much better/takes less space/runs faster/etc. I tried installing it while connected to the internet and while disconnected from the internet and nothing is working..."

,cajunboy2208,2010-09-01T22:32Z,"Jaker_K17
I have the same problem. This is the 2nd version I have tried.
I burned one to a CD, and that error came up.
I tried this one, I am always connected to the internet, I have cable, and I still get the same error.
I am running Vista Ultimate x64
It just will not let me upgrade.
I might have to do a clean install =("
,sthlm1967,2010-09-05T13:05Z,"A couple of days after installing, I have got... ""This copy of Windows is not genuine"".
Can somebody advice.

Thanks"
,Arquebusa,2010-09-07T03:37Z,"yeah, actually this torrent has 3 bad things...
1. this is NOT bootable!.
2. the activation method used was not compatible with my desktop, so the boot file destroyed.
3. maybe the uploader has modified another things too in this torrent.

i very tired to download another 64 bit.
i push my reset button when the installation almost complete to avoid the unusable activation by the uploader.

and use another loader that works 100% with me, and pass update too!

whatever, thanks for uploader and seeders..."

,drarkan,2010-10-29T09:12Z,"I have had problems with XP in which when I ran live update i was locked out cause it was not genuine. 

I have been running this copy of windows 7 from this torrent for about 6-8 months or more now, and so far being safe by not updating it. I seem to currently have some buggy issues probably related to needing updates. 

Will running live update with this copy of Windows 7 open up some issues with it being cracked? I don't want to have to reinstall windows and restart with a new desktop since I've already gone through that headache in the past waaaay to many times that i've gotten good at reinstalling the OS and software. LOL."
