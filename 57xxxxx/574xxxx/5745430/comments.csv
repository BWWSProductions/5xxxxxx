,unitarity,2011-11-10T00:41Z,"This is a very, very nice torrent yet there are whining ingrates complaining about cue and log files.  And pregap info!  You  must be kidding.

Do you need help finding your way home?  If you need a cue file, make it yourself.  It's quite easy, but maybe not for whiners.

Log files are a security blanket.  You don't really need your binky.  Honest.

Thanks to ScamboEtico.

,beano311,2012-06-25T04:13Z,"A few things. First, just to point out (I'm not complaining) the info lists ""The Clash (U.K. Version)"" while the torrent actually contains the U.S. Version, big difference there (about 5 songs are replaced with 6 different songs on the US version).
Second, shut up about the log and cue files. Third, where's ""Cut the Crap""? (I'm kidding, no one wants to listen to that ""Clash"" album).
Fourth, thanks for the upload."
