The commentators are fast talking high hyperbolic, difficult-to-impossible to follow. The camera work isn't in realtime, just a collage of fast moving images designed to blind the viewer. Then there's the annoying sports feedline at the bottom of the screen too. Based on this... I would never subscribe to ESPN* and I won't download any more of their junk either. Thanks, however, to the uploader for his/her effort."

The small sports banner at the bottom can be easily ignored and the actual poker content is as good as coverage from any other events.

Great uploads, thanks!
