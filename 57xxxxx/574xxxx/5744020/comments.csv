describe your problem, does it says that to activate offline mode you have to play multiplayer first ? If so try typing in Scruffy_Pupy, passwordupdate"

,wira020,2010-08-10T22:42Z,Help please.. I cant even run it.. default program for minecraft.jar should be javaw.exe right? Using win 7 64 bit here... 
,wira020,2010-08-11T03:54Z,Forget bout it.. runs fine after i update my java thingy.. but it's weird that i'm in this world like in fps mode... cant seem to build anything at all... i dont see what purpose there is... dont see any other mode other than the single player fps like mode... multiplayer is of course unplayable...
,Werttit,2010-08-11T15:26Z,"wira020, how the fuck did you even get to offline mode? what account you used?"
,bragesb,2010-08-11T23:47Z,"This doesn't work for me. What happens is I try to login, it fails, I click the ""play offline"" button, it says done loading and all off a sudden everything goes black.

,Minecraft,2010-08-13T15:49Z,"@hiir007

,Lucky13s,2010-08-14T22:46Z,"To play offline follow the damn instructions, holy fuck its not that hard, I got it first try.

I know the /v/irgin instructions there are fucking stupid and annoying but its not that hard to understand it. Dump your folder in your appdata, run using minecraft.jar, log in with the account, play offline.

Before you were able to play multiplayer by manually connecting to private servers, but since the game has updated to 1.016, you cannot join most of these servers anymore.

Anyone know where to download 1.016 and anyone have a working bro account for it? 
/v/'s multiplayer survival private server is 71.204.7.245 and requires the latest update."
,Werttit,2010-08-15T11:36Z,"Ok, if you're using windows xp, the .minecraft folder doesnt go to ""roaming"" folder, only ""application data"".. So now i was able to ""play offline"", BUT it only flashes the purple ""blahblah productions"" screen and then crashes. :( halp"

,Lucky13s,2010-08-16T18:38Z,"Yeah it works for me, but only offline mode. This is fine anyways since all you want is singleplayer. Multiplayer survival does work well, and you can find better 'private' servers to play on anyways.

If you want just freebuild, the client is free to play from the minecraft webpage."

Notch currently makes just over $100,000 a day. So why would i feel sad that he quit his job? Also if you care so much, why are you looking at a torrent for it? "
,Minecraft,2010-09-24T15:15Z,"@digitalbluco
you also forgot to mention that Notch used free, open sourced game called ""Infiminer"" to create minecraft and hasn't given a single dollar out of is 2.2m usd to the guys who created the basically half of the game AND that dipshit viral marketed ""his"" game over fucking forums, spamming threads and posts. I say robbing that faggot is like stealing from riches and giving to the poor a.k.a fair."

1) Download this torrent (duh)
2) Extract the file. IF you don't know how...GTFO.
3) Goto C:\Users\*User Name*\AppData\Roaming
4) Paste all files into this folder. Replace all existing files.
5) Run Minecraft.jar
6) Login as Scruffy_Puppy with a password of ""Passwordupdate"".
7) Play offline.

Enjoy =)"

,Minecraft,2010-09-27T20:43Z,"@tynddol & dijipo
try reinstalling the junk, disconnect from internet and then try. If problem persist that means Notch the Faggot hasn't patched it and its your comp. All I can suggest atm is to download newest net. framework.

BTW mah torrent reached top 100 pc games

You are retarded. Literally. I am a PC technician in training, you can run this game fine, with 1GB ddr2 RAM, a Pentium 4 processor which is almost if not already legacy. Even an integrated graphics would do. There is no way in hell that you would require the specs you listed to play this game. Quit being a scriptkiddie and stfu if you do not know what you are talking about.

You're wrong there actually. He's not taken any code from infiniminer whatsoever.

Both because they're written in completely different languages, and because he started making it before the source code for infiniminer was even available.

http://www.minecraftaccounts.com?join=47791

Here is a precise guide of what you have to do:

1. go and register, it's free and just make a second email that you will use to register and fill out the surveys, cause you WILL get alot of spam ;D

2. once you've registered successfully go and complete some surveys, by doing these surveys you ears points(ranging from 5 to 50), once you have earned 200 points you can get your own free minecraft account.

Now you will probably be thinking: this can't be true, why would they give me a free account.
Well basically by completing those small ( and free) surveys, the site that will buy you the account will get a small revenue, and that revenue is then translated by them into points( that you can see on your account). your can calculate this way that 200 point is about the same as 15 dollars/euros
