,ComicsPlus,2011-09-29T18:17Z,"Dude....what are you babbling about?  The only ""FAKE!!!"" here is YOU.

Before you spammed it, this Torrent was for the movie's SCRIPTS, not the movie itself.

Can you read, man?"

,trafficjam89,2011-10-15T08:45Z,"I agree with both of hitnrun4fun's comments. Most movie's would be out by now. I wonder what watching a movie in a theater is like, cams ftw"
,codemeister1990,2011-10-18T06:03Z,"I go to see movies once in a while, but gone are the times where you could afford to see them all the time. Cinema and home-video/dvd/blu-ray has simply become to expensive to consume in any decent amount, so torrents are a natural second source of media"
,12angel,2011-10-30T16:30Z,"Guys, nay info about ""Moneyball 2011 DVDRip XviD-TARGET"". Torrent is removed, but still downloading. Fake or real???"
