These are two different drafts of the screenplay for 'Moneyball', the forthcoming movie. (However, it seems that the movie will vary widely from both of these drafts.)

The Steven Zaillian first draft is dated December 1, 2008.
The Steven Soderbergh re-write is dated June 2, 2009.

Note that the book of the same name that this is based off of (by MIchael Lewis) is also readily available.
