,ronaldoortiz1958,2010-08-10T17:59Z,Hi eric! i stuck at 88% since yesterday! will i get the 100% or i have to delete?? i liked your torrent it's very complete :(
,ericplayzbass,2010-08-11T04:59Z,i'm going to keep seeding (BECAUSE FUCKING NOBODY ELSE IS AND I KNOW AT LEAST 10 PEOPLE HAVE IT) so you'll get it eventually.
,ronaldoortiz1958,2010-08-11T17:20Z,"in the beginning my download was very quick but when come to 88% it stuck and the velocity now is 0.1, 0.2kB/s :( since monday this download stuck at 88.0 % ...i keep it on download because i think your collection of rush songs is awesome and very complete...i would like to thank you for keep seeding...i think i will can get soon the entire thing..sorry my bad english"

Well now, we have 0 (ZERO) seeders, and 130 leechers. This means, the uploader who promises to seed, is not seeding. 

It is not like this thread is years old. He just stated this TODAY. Look at the dates. Nice of you to compile this, eric, but quit the games and seed your own shit."
,MJKW2Ab,2010-08-17T02:46Z,"Sounds cool based on the description. I was unaware of the bootlegs listed. I just wanted to maybe suggest something... I realize 320 kbps MP3 is pretty high quality for a compressed audio file. But once I started hearing the improvement with AAC compression I was sold. So I guess maybe someday when I have all of the best copies and remasters of RUSH on FLAC perhaps I can get a collection of all Rush albums converted to something like AAC@224kbps - Honestly if you have never heard it, I believe it sounds better than MP3 @ 320kbps and maintains a file size close to MP3. 

Anyway, THANKS ERIC for this RUSH compilation, it appears most interesting. "
,paoloo,2010-08-17T20:04Z,"been trying for a week, still no seeds.  not worth it."
,MJKW2Ab,2010-08-18T06:18Z,"paoloo: It appears some folks are re-seeding this. Right now I see EIGHT SEEDERS and well over 200 leechers. Nevertheless, being a serious Rush fan I already got the REAL FLAC - Rush Disogrophy of the main 19 CDs they have released. (Not the torrent made from mp3 to flac!) - However I do not have many of the remasters and bootlegs. I would prefer to Download Rush Remastered CDs in FLAC, or maybe AAC@224 or higher.  Compare Mp3@320KBPS to the same song ripped in AAC@224 or higher and I feel many more people will be making rips in AAC for Itunes/Ipod use. But nothing beats FLAC (Ipod uses Apple Lossless instead, conversion is needed) - AGAIN THIS TORRENT APPEARS TO CURRENTLY BE RE-SEEDED BY 8 SEEDS."
,atreadwell,2010-09-01T07:07Z,"Please! Seeed. :-)
Looking forward to it."
,Volkerball,2010-09-02T00:11Z,"Please seed your torrents for fucks sake!
whats the point to upload a torrent if you are not able to dl it??"
,cobrajkb,2010-09-08T02:15Z,PLEASE SEED. PLEASE SEED. PLEASE SEED. PLEASE SEED. PLEASE SEED
,richfiles,2011-01-12T06:19Z,"I've been seeding 90.72% of this for some time now. Where's the other 9.28% We're missing. I'll happily seed the whole thing, but we have got to have some help here.

SEED PLZ!!!"
,ericplayzbass,2011-09-08T20:07Z,"forgive this torrent, I stopped seeding because my internet got shut off for a while, and I forgot about it. Someday soon I'll be able to reupload it and I hope some of you will come back, as I'll actually be able to seed again.

sorry guys :( I put tons of effort into this too."
