An [EPB] Release


Something I've been wanting to do for a LONG TIME, about a year I think. I guess I was too busy/lazy to get it done but I just sat here for the past 10 hours converting to MP3@320 from the flac, which was made from CD Rips (Audiochecker log has been included, where I proved the FLAC files were CDDA, and tagging them all properly.

All studio albums, live albums, and the new Carvan/BU2B single are included, as well as my 5 favorite Rush bootleg live albums.

1978-10-20 - A Desert Passage
1986-04-16 - Visions and Illusions V2.2 (speed corrected)
1992-06-14 - Vital Dreams
1996-05-12 - Bigger & Better in Texas
2002-10-13 - One Big Victory



This release is a MUST HAVE for any true RUSH fan!






All albums are tagged with a year as well as title (ie: 1981 - Moving Pictures) in the metadata so no matter what music library you use, they will appear chronologically.


Album art is also included.
