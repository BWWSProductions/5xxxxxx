I will wait for some more leaked copies..."
[T],Games4theworld,2010-08-10T15:13Z,"Hello,

@supanut2000

That's obviously because there aren't any official releases yet. You should be happy that you could at least use it for 180 days and re-activate it for another 180 days with only 2 clicks."
,trainer12,2010-08-13T07:40Z,This works fully. Comes with 64 and 32 bit versions.
,Strongcut1,2010-08-13T11:19Z,Got a trojan warning when installing
[T],Games4theworld,2010-08-13T12:26Z,"Hello,

@Strongcut1

I recommend you (temporary) turn off your Anti-Virus, Install the program and then turn your Anti-Virus on again."
,supanut2000,2010-08-14T15:38Z,"@games for theworld
Are you a fucking moron? The public release was like on 15th June, which is nearly 2 months from that date.
Look on Wikipedia and you'll see that the offical release was like 2 months ago.
Since the retail is now available, there should be now leaked retail keys. I'm still using Office2003 in my laptop, but the comp I'm writing now has office 2010 with a key that no longer works on my laptop.
Please give me a office 2010 key, either pirated or genuine. I don't have like 2,000,000THB to buy the fucking thing...I know if I buy it, I will become Billgates' slave like some rumers says.
I'm planning to downgrade my pc to 2003 if M$ kill my key in the future."
,supanut2000,2010-08-14T15:43Z,"Also...
You mean 180 days of reactivation?
Dude...I'm still in school...who would have a fucking time to activate it...my laptop is fucking slow and If I activate during sschool times then it would takes like until lunch...don't you fucking understand?
Dude...you is just another fucking trolls that claims some f*ke activators that don't even work...do not download this shit...if you have a  laptop it will take you very long to activate and if you're in school you can't do anything until lunch and you will have like a pile of bullshit works to catch up..."
,MD2k,2010-08-14T19:33Z,"Hi Games4theworld,

I'm running into an issue with your activator

The message says the following:
--------------------------NOTE---------------------------

In case of error 0x8007000D make following steps:

Repeat activation attempts. In case the error is still there

1. Turn off firewall and antivirus.
2. Make trial reset (rearm).
3. Also try to reinstall KMS-Client key of Office 2010.

Try to activate again.

Press any key to exit...
-------------------------------------------------------

I've tried to turn off firewall & Anti Virus, rearmed my office but I'm still getting the same error. Any ideas?"
[T],Games4theworld,2010-08-14T19:34Z,"Hello,

@supanut2000

Instead of being thankful that you get something for free which, as you said, costs a lot, you're calling me a fucking moron? And then you expect me to give you a nice answer?
Obviously I can see you're a schoolkid, seen the fact that you don't understand that I meant an official release for Downloading. You think I didn't know Office 2010 was already released?
That you don't have the time to activate it, isn't my / our problem, is it? I'm just telling you that you just need to perform 2 clicks in order to reactivate it. How funny you're prejudicing that this torrent doesn't work, even due you haven't even tried it out yet.

Please, instead of wasting my time giving you an answer, go Download from someone who actually provides working quality torrents and gives you free support for it too."
[T],Games4theworld,2010-08-14T19:35Z,"Hello,

@MD2k

Try the following:

1. Uninstall Office 2010.
2. Restart your PC. (!)
3. Reinstall Office 2010.
4. Follow the steps as in the Installation Guide."
,supanut2000,2010-08-15T01:56Z,Any Office retail keys? Either pirated or genuine.

,supanut2000,2010-08-15T15:35Z,"Yeah...do not download this shit! This activator is fake!
All of these so called activators are fake. Giving users 180 days is not an activation. An activator should permanently activate the product."
,MD2k,2010-08-15T16:57Z,"@Game4World:

Same thing happened again.  I think it has to do with a messed up installation that I've had before.

Error:Activation failed after 16 attempts.

Then it tells me Installed product key detected and that its attempting to activate that product key (which is not legit) followed by the error 0x8007000D telling me to shut down AV and firewall, reinstall the service.etc "
[T],Games4theworld,2010-08-15T19:45Z,"Hello,

@supanut2000

No, not yet. Even if one leaked, it would be blacklisted as soon as it is released.


@J-E-P-P-E

Áll ® Games4theworld Downloads are 100% virus free. Please see the ""Trusted"" skull next to the name.


@supanut2000

It ís an Activator, an activator for 180 days. If it isn't activating it, then you couldn't use it, so it ís an Activator actually.


@MD2k

Did you extract all the files in the .rar file to a folder on your Desktop before continuing the Installation?

What do you mean? Just do as said in the Installation Guide.

 i installed office but when i tried activating ,it showed error no local kms server found. it is given in the instructions to type ""1"" in case of such an error . but where should i type it? (after the error commandline it shows ""press any key to exit"" so if i type 1 it just exits). also i tried reinstalling office turning off firewall and av. "
[T],Games4theworld,2010-08-20T19:50Z,"Hello,

It should say ""Press 3 to exit"", but don't press 3. When the command window shows up, just type ""1"" and then press [ENTER].
After ""Activation successful. 1 attempt used.
Press any key to exit..."", you're done and you can go on with the next step."

I'm actually amazed that you are still in school. Unless you are in your 30's and you are in grade 9. Then I believe it. Do you ride the short bus? Do you war a hockey helmut around, but you're not on a team? You really should stay on the Ritalin. Could it be that your parents are brother and sister?

@amvignesh

Try the following:

1. Open the Activator and press ""Restart Service"". You may get an error.
2. Now press ""Install / Uninstall KMService"".
3. Click on ""Activation Office 2010 VL"".
4. Check if it's activated by clicking on ""Activation check Office 2010"".

@KrazyK89

No, sorry, I don't know that user. And no, it's not possible to get blocked from someone's torrent -page, but it is possible he/she has deleted his/her account. (Then all torrents will disappear) You should try to Google on the name to see if you can find any of his/her torrents.


@aira120589

First of all, please note that Ã¡ll Â® Games4theworld Downloads are 100% safe and 100% virus free.
The reason you have to turn of your AV is that if you keep it on, the whole Installation WILL NOT work. Also, you don't have actual trojans on your system; your AV will only detect them as a torjan/virus, because of the way the most Crack's are packed. (They look a lot similar to trojans, but they aren't in fact) 
I recommend you restart your PC, turn off your AV and then continue the Installation. If you're really afraid of getting viruses into your system (even) from a ""trusted"" uploader, then I recommend you do not ever Download a .torrent file again."
