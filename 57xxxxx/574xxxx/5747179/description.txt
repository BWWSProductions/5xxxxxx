Swanlights, the new album from Antony and the Johnsons arrives October 11 in Europe via Rough Trade and October 12 in the U.S. via Secretly Canadian. But Swanlights won't be the only new Antony joint out soon. The five-song EP Thank You for Your Love will be out August 24 in the U.S. and August 30 in Europe.
The EP's title track will also appear on Swanlights, and you can stream it through the widget above or download it in exchange for an email address over at Antony's new website. The EP also features a couple of intriguing covers. Antony and ambient composer William Basinski take on John Lennon's covered-to-death "Imagine", and Antony and guitarist Kevin Barker (Currituck Co.) cover Bob Dylan's largely forgotten 1980 song "Pressing On".
