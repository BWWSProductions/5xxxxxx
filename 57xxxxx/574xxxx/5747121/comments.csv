,Boklau,2010-08-08T19:09Z,At least it's a new cam version that's less crappy but I'll wait for the R5...

,MMPHC,2010-08-09T01:42Z,Come on Dude.Take it off here.
,chair_tard,2010-08-09T08:26Z,"This is really a high resolution cam. It needs cleaned up because it appears the director didn't use a tripod, but that can be fixed by one of the excellent repack releasers... I hope they take a look at this, there is no crop, just a little flicker, and the resolution is 720p. thx."

,possemaste,2010-08-12T07:54Z,"Please stop putting Crap Screeners in Highres video category.

Highres means 720p (real) or higher.

1280 x 720 BLUR SHIT is not highres

High res means crisp lines.

Put your cheap ass HD ready Camcorder shit in the normal category."

,whyisdaddy,2010-08-12T23:16Z,"I wish  people would stop bitching about every
little thing !

If you want a better video before the DVD is out,
then shoot the fucking thing yourself and stop bitching.
"
,hauntnut,2010-08-14T06:39Z,"This can still be considered high-resolution because it was recorded at 720p, and despite the fact that it's not going to capture the movie like a Blu-Ray, it's still 720p, plain and simple (compare this one to a copy that's only 700mb. However, the constantly shifting camera makes this a cam, not a telesync copy. Telesync copies don't jump around all over the place."
,J33SEJ,2010-08-16T11:45Z,"Thanks for the time and effort on this up But sadly it's like watchin the blair witch all over again with someone running with a cam (All be it a hd one) And i didnt like that Blair shit the first time round! 
This release certainly shouldnt be in this catagory

A:5 V:5 (Or 10 if you watch it while working out on your treadmill!)"
,AgentHitman,2010-08-17T21:43Z,"Fake or not,I'll download it!"
,AgentHitman,2010-08-18T14:53Z,The quality sucks!Better I download the .AVI version!That's much better.
,Exerz,2010-08-20T09:05Z,"What a waste of time. Whoever filmed the can't hold the camera straight at all.

This should not be in HighRes. Even though the size of the video file is 720p, the quality if the source is low. "
,qsker,2010-09-10T12:10Z,"WARNING! THIS IS NOT HD, IT IS FILMED IN HD AT A CINEMA."
,nabarun69,2010-09-14T20:47Z,"as a highres print

,nabarun69,2010-09-14T20:48Z,"don't dwnld this

,panzersiddhartha,2010-10-02T12:53Z,"If I take a true 1080p film camera and shakingly film my old 30 inch TV showing a bad VHS release of the Addams family, it would NOT automatically be a good idea to put it in the Highres category of The Pirate Bay. "
,MEHNESH,2010-10-22T14:03Z,Fake!
