,RyderMultimedia,2010-08-24T15:00Z,what is AvastSvc.exe listed as in windows 7?
[V],RobbingHood,2010-08-25T02:04Z,"@RyderMultimedia 

In Windows 7 maybe AvastSvc.exe is listed as Kaspersky.exe? These av guys think weird, so you may never know.

Or wait ... maybe ... just maybe ... maybe it's just listed as AvastSvc

If not then it probably is listed as Norton.exe, or just as Norton. Norton sounds just like avast,
so it would be logical. At least, right now it would to me ...... Although, maybe it's listed
as Avira.exe, or even as BitDefender.exe ........"

,Mistapickles,2010-09-25T17:34Z,"TL;DR This torrent CAN fuck up your PC.


I'm a long time user of pirate bay. I've downloaded 10,000+ gigs of software and uploaded 10x that. Before today I've never had an account as the comments are typically retarded, although very useful in certain circumstances, this being one of them.

This torrent, regardless of what the uploader believes, is malformed. I believed the info file saying anti-virus software considers this a virus and to neglect the warning because this is sometimes the case, however in this situation the .dll file locked my PC after reboot. Whenever I entered the desktop it slowly lost response until the entire system froze.

Please, take this torrent down and either repair it or add a warning message that it could fuck your computer over. Honestly it was simple enough to fix, but a lot of people who pirate aren't very computer literate, so be a good guy and save some people the grief."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-09-26T00:21Z,"@Mistapickles 

For your information: the crack is a modified .dll file. As mentioend in the description it's detected by a few av scanners. The reason why it's detected may have different reasons, which is also mentioned in the desciption.

What is commented here by n00bs is not important. This torrent is used and tested by many trusted users and even TPB mods, and I have used it myself.

For someone who claims to be an expert you make no sense at all and don't provide any fact. All the bla bla bla is gonna get nobody anywhere.
As mentioned earlier: go ahead and report this torrent if you think it's infected. And read the description once more, cause obviously you've missed all important info."

,bradwurst,2010-09-30T17:36Z,"@ aireent777

dude we had the same problem before. i ha win7 too XD

here's what i did:

- go to the windows task manager
- click the ""services"" tab (the 3rd tab)
- on the lower right corner click the ""Services..."" (the one with the ""run as admin"" icon), it will let you go to the services window thingy XD
- search and highlight the ""avast! antivirus""
- on the upper left click ""stop""
- and tada! the ""terminate avastsvc"" thingy is done :D

......now you can copy-paste-replace the crack on the original folder :D

note: there are 2 other services on that window that is with avast like the e-mail guard something, dont highlight them, just highlight the ""avast! antivirus"" and those two will be automatically stopped when you click stop button :D

......the thing why i found out about the services thing is i realized that ""Svc"" means ""services"" XD

@ previous posts

sorry i didnt replied with the questions XD ... i wasnt checking any comments from the day i posted my last comment :D. anyway there's the newer version avast torrent already released by robbinghood... so if future problems like this happens just read my instructions :D  "
,ErowidZero,2010-10-07T02:25Z,"Hello [RH]. I should start by saying that everything appears to be working quite well, but I do have some questions/comments.  To be clear, I deeply appreciate what you guys do for this site and these are NOT complaints.

First, after completing the initial full system scan there were 6 errors due to invalid file paths found.  The program is looking for DLLs in ..avast5\defs\10062800\ however the directory only contains folders for ""10100601"" and ""10100602"".  Why would a fresh installation look for invalid paths?  Unless you suggest something else, I'll use the exceptions lists.

Also, step 9 of the installation notes could not be completed - the fresh install appeared to already have its trial license. The subscription details don't quite match what is posted here, but the expiration is still 2020.  The user name is ""DEMO"" but it appears to be fully active.

I apologize if this seems like nit-picking or irrelevant - I don't want to be another Frost_Thessaloniki bugging the shit out of you.
