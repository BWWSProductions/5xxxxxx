This book is not for the beginner as it does not present basic conditioning for someone 
starting from scratch. For more advanced lifters, the suggestions in the book might be
fun. The contra-lateral theory he presents is nearly laughable though.

Darden trains and tracks the progress of two people using the routine described in "42 days". I
wish he tracked a larger group of persons and those who are a little more 'ordinary'. He trains
one person who is already an accomplished amateur bodybuilder and another guy who is 18, of a 
hefty frame, and an athlete. I would like to see Darden train someone who isn't a newbie, but 
who also isn't already a bodybuilder. I would also like to see this routine work on persons
of slimmer build and who have a difficult time gaining weight..........................
