hi dude , i need ur help , i finished downloading cop out day yesterday and started uploading at the speed of 4-10 kb/s , what i want is the upload speed to increase to like at least 50 or so , i have a 4 mega connection so help me pls !

ya also i will get ""ponyo"" maybe after a day or two , someone requested it in one of ur torrents . so i will upload it sometime in the next week !!!! "
[T],ctang,2010-08-10T01:25Z,@metal1dead:  in utorrent go to your settings and make sure you have upload limit set to 0 because this means unlimited upload speed (same thing for download speed or limit or whatever your program calls it)...if you have some other program it should be the same thing
,Metal1Dead,2010-08-10T03:04Z,"@ctang 
[utorrent] in bandwidth -> the upload is set to 0 . While in queueing under seed while , te ratio was set to ""150"" % and the time to ""0"" , i then made the ratio ""0"" . It felt odd so i returned it back to ""150"" . Any suggestion ????"
,Metal1Dead,2010-08-10T04:14Z,"a little search there and there , came to know that the ratio thingy is the duration u want to seed a torrent for . and that u can't determine what is ur upload speed going to be in a torrent !"
,Metal1Dead,2010-08-10T04:17Z,"its all about te ""leechers"" the more the leechers and very few seeders ur upload speed will be the fastest it can"
[T],ctang,2010-08-11T23:36Z,right on
,cafun107,2010-08-13T03:43Z,"Ok i know this has nothing to do with this forum.....but does anyone know how to convert PAL format to NTSC format, cause men there some good movies out there but they are PAL with boatloads of seeders unlike NTSC!!!!! "
