,dogchicken,2010-08-08T10:31Z,Does anyone know how to download Rars?
,FRLogan,2010-08-08T11:35Z,"Hi,
Uncompress RARs using WinRar or any utility such as 7-Zip (free)."
,BuzznBee,2010-08-09T14:37Z,"Yuppers - I use to freak too with RAR files ..but quickly realized is doesn't MATTER with WinRar being such a peach of a proggie. Simply click on ONE RAR file and the entire deal unpacks.
Easy as 1 2 3 !!
Panic OVER :)
Thanks for the upload Scenebalance - a very reasonable size compared to what's out there AND Pillars is a great download !!!"
