Show Nfo - Misfits is a British live-action superhero comedy-drama.

Misfits follows five teenagers on community service who get struck by lightning and are given special powers. Kelly (Lauren Socha) gains the ability to read the thoughts of others, Curtis (Nathan Stewart Jarrett) can rewind time, Alisha (Antonia Thomas) sends people into a sexual frenzy when they touch her skin, and Simon (Iwan Rheon) can become invisible. Seemingly left unaffected is smart Alec Nathan (Robert Sheehan), although his power is revealed in the sixth episode.


Enjoy and please help me seed!
