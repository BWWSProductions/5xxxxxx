NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Splice

Sources used was the russian r5 dvdr and the studio audio off the korean dvdrip .....thanks to both 
Now this was a bitch to do....until we found that the studio release as 2 scenes less than the r5 
So what we've done is synced the studio audio to the r5 but where the extra scenes are there is some silence or repeat
audio....you'll see what we mean.
Theres one at 9mins 11 secs which last for 5 secs and then one at 1hr 19mins which last 15 secs.....I guess we could of cut them 
out not said but we've opted to release it like this.
As for the work done on the video....damn was so long ago we can't remember   but it would have been our usual stuff.

Anyway Enjoy
