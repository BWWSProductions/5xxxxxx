Theme Description

Full Metal Alchemist is happy and slightly childish on the outside, while being so thoroughly dark and sinister in the core. It’s a pretty dark world Ed and Al live in, filled with serial killers, scientists playing with lives to enhance their alchemy skills and untrustworthy people betraying those they love, and many, many more bad people.

But at the center of everything are these two brothers, following each other to the outskirts of their world to find a way to claim back their physical bodies. Their relationship is so cute. While big mouth and risk taker Ed is somewhat of a short guy, the young sibling Alphonse is a huge talking cyborg with the voice of a child.

For all the fans of Full Metal Alchemist – we have this wonderful Windows 7 FMA Theme. The Theme consists of 25+ Hi-res Wallpapers, Custom Icons and Select sounds from the beautiful soundtrack of this Anime."

    * Nearly every member of the military (Mustang, Hawkeye, Fury, Havoc, Hughes, and even Riza’s dog, Black Hayate) is named after some type of mid-20th century military aircraft. Most of them are WWII-era airplanes. The exception to the aircraft rule is Bradley, who seems to be named after a modern APC, which was named after WW2 General Omar Bradley.
    * The names of the homunculi are all named after the seven deadly sins.(Pride, Envy, Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth and Wrath)
    *Full Metal Alchemist is an exceptionally good Anime and Manga Series. In two TV Asahi web polls, the anime was voted #1 most popular anime of all time in Japan. Considering the number of awesome animes that Japanese create, this certainly tells us how good this anime really is.
    *But its influence just doesn’t stop in Japan. FMA was nominated in six of the eight categories for which it was eligible, at the American Anime Awards in February 2007, winning awards in five of them. It has been accepted and praised all over."
