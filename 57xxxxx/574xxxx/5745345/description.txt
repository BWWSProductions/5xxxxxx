| "After 10 years of impressive releases for Offshore, Good Looking and      |
| Covert Operations, ASC drops his new album on Instra:mental's excellent    |
| Nonplus Records. With 'Nothing Is Certain' he's created a defining moment  |
| for the Autonomic canon, focussed on glowing, far-eastern                  |
| electro-referencing melodies and agile modern tech-step programming.       |
| 'Matter Of Time' sets his agenda with exceptional production values        |
| before swinging into the lush but fractured minimalism of 'Opus' and       |
| taking a moment for reflection on the beatless 'Conversations'.            |
| 'Microsia' and 'The Depths' are tricker half-timed beat experiments and    |
| there's even a stab at slow swung electro-house in 'Textura'. Back in      |
| 180bpm mode 'Losing You' and 'The Ubiquity Incident' shift back into       |
| steppers gear with impressively widescreen results. ASC is in              |
| sophisticated form and should be checked by any fans of DBridge,           |
| Instra:mental, Sabre etc. Recommended."                                    |
