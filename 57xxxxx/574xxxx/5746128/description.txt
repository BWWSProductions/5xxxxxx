Garbagebage Present:

A recording of a more than 6 hour set that DJ Cliff Hang'ah played last New Year at an undisclosed location. Entitled 'The Set That Never Was' for promotional reasons.

Why 'The Set That Never Was?'

Well, because it could have been played at your establishment - had you the foresight to book him first!

This is Part 1 of 3

Sorry!!!

The track list for part one has gone missing!
