Vanished In The Twinkling Of An Eye

Pastor John Hagee teams up with Christian film producers Peter and Paul Lalonde (REVELATION) for this dramatization of the aftermath of the rapture.

Pastor Hagee acts as the viewer's guide on a journey through the Great Tribulation, a time of chaos and confusion and a time when the faith of those left behind will be tested as they endure an almost unimaginable time of hardship. As the action unfolds, Pastor Hagee appears periodically to relate the on screen action to the Word of God so that he might explain how each scene is prophesied by the Bible, and how one might avoid being one of those left behind.
