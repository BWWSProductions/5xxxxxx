,Tamarind777,2010-08-13T21:38Z,This belief is absolutely unfounded in Scriptures. Jesus was very clear that the church WILL go through the tribulation.
,Tamarind777,2010-08-13T22:18Z,"This doctrine of the rapture is a doctrine of devils and is designed to lead people astray. Itâ€™s entirely unfounded in Scripture. It teaches contrary to sound Biblical teachings and is very dangerous. It says those who are ""left behind"" will be the lost and some will be given a â€œthirdâ€ chance at salvation, the save will be raptured, and that the church will not go through the tribulation. Where in the Bible does it say that any group of people will be given a third chance? As individuals God gives us hundreds and thousands of chances during our life, but not the lost on a whole. Here is the confusion: this entire left behind lie is based on the passage where Jesus compared His second return with the days of Noah. He said, â€œAs it were in the days of Noah, so will also the coming of the Son of man be.â€ In the first part of His statement, He highlighted the decadence that took place in Noah's time and said the same will happen shortly before He returns. That was one point He was making.

Second, in making this analogy, He also compared His second coming with the flood and how it was a time of judgment for the lost of that time. He said, ""Two will be in the field, one will taken, the other left;"" ""two will be in the bed, one taken, the other left."" Taken by what? During the flood, how were they ""taken"" and who were ""taken?"" This is the point of confusion. In the time of the flood, those who were ""taken"" were lost, NOT saved! They were ""taken"" away by the flood! Jesus said, ""He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved."" The ones who were â€œleftâ€ behind DURING the flood were safe in the ark and were saved. Noah and his family represented the church and DID go through the flood. God never spared them from it. Only that they were safe onboard the boat. If you even compare salvation with the Hebrew boys, they were not spared from going through the fire, but were saved THROUGH the fire. This is clear throughout Scripture.

The doctrine of the rapture is a false teaching that is designed by the Devil to teach people that they will get another chance at salvation, if they don't choose Jesus today they can wait until later and do it then. This is a lie and the Devilâ€™s trap. There will be NO third chance. In fact, this IS your chance to accept salvation through Jesus today. The Bible says, ""If you hear my voice, harden not your heart;"" ""Today is the day of salvation."" People, donâ€™t believe the lie of the â€œsecretâ€ rapture, itâ€™s complete lie and itâ€™s dangerous. The Bible says when Jesus returns, there will be nothing secret about it. First, there will be a trumpet sound so loud it will wake the dead. Second, mountains will sway like a reed in the wind, island will disappear, and there will be a tremendous earthquake that will pretty much level everything. But, Godâ€™s people will be safe. â€œTrust in the Lord and lean not onto your own understanding.â€ Trust in the Word of God only people, itâ€™s the only source of truth for Salvation."

,orinvee,2010-08-16T14:28Z,"Tamarind: It's good that you are exposing the lies of the ""Left Behind"" series and the false doctrine of the rapture but your exegesis is somewhat faulty.

One of the key points in comparing the time of Noah with the end time resurrection is the NUMBER of the saved (8) as compared to the number lost. To even further prove this point, He reiterates this point by comparing it to the days of Lot in Sodom where only Lot and his daughters were spared. God's point is not to quantify the number saved but to show how few will heed the call to salvation: ""many are called but few are chosen"" and ""narrow is the way...that leads to salvation and few that find it."" Amazingly, of the two billion or so 'Christians' in the world, very few are known of God: ""Haven't we cast out demons...and done all manners of work IN YOUR NAME?"" they will ask Jesus and He will say, ""DEPART from me, you LAWBREAKERS, I NEVER KNEW YOU!"". These are the billions of false Christians who have believed a false gospel, who have been fooled by Satan who ""deceives the WHOLE WORLD""! The saved will not be ""the hearers of the Word"" (the majority of 'Christians') but the DOERS! ""Not everyone who says, 'Lord, Lord' but he who DOES the will of the Father"".

Satan's deception is on many fronts. His BIGGEST lie is the doctrine of the Trinity (1Ti 2:5  For there is ONE God, and one mediator between God and men, the MAN Christ Jesus;). Another big one is the ETERNAL TORMENT of sinners (Joh 3:16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not PERISH, but have everlasting life.). There are many more, such as the immediate passage to heaven or hell at death instead of 'sleep' (1Co 15:51  Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all SLEEP, but we shall all be changed,). 

Keep searching the scriptures but do so with ALL preconceived notions swept aside. The scripture RARELY aligns with what is taught in the pulpit."
