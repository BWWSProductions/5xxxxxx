[V],poppedtart,2010-08-07T19:33Z,"I want to maintain the highest quality standards with universal compatibility.  Apple TV will give the best end user experience due to its ability to interpret all of the advanced meta tagging.

These are also compatible with iPad and iPhone 4 though I don't list that in the description.  Probably should update that :)"
