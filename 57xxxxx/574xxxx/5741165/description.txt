Frank Leone is nearing the end of his prison term for a relatively minor crime.
 Just before he is paroled, however, Warden Drumgoole takes charge. 
Drumgoole was assigned to a hell-hole prison after his administration was
 publicly humiliated by Leone, and has now arrived on the scene to ensure that
 Leone never sees the light of day.

Subtitles show the right characters (saved under the right Unicode ISO).
In the future if you find subs not showing the right characters do the following:
If the subs are muxed in mkv download & use MKVextractGUI to extract(demux) the subtitles from mkv, 
and mkvmerge GUI to mux back the edited/repaired sub in the mkv.
Download Notepad++ (free)  from    
http://sourceforge.net/projects/notepad-plus/ 
 The sub you demuxed from mkv Open and save as...ANSI !(Important!)
Right click on the sub, Open with nppIExplorerShell.exe (Notepad++ exe)
click Encoding(upper part menu)Character sets and chose the language ISO.
Click again on Encoding then click on Convert to UTF-8 or Unicode Big Indian, save as...srt. 
You're done with the encoding, now you can mux it back in the mkv with mkvmergeGUI.

Those with Win 7 64 bit might have issues with playing back secondary or external audios & subs etc.
If k-lite pack(too complicated) not working try CCCP 
    (    http://www.cccp-project.net/   )
 based on the same player (Media Player Classic).

All my torrents are seeded. I regularly check back my older torrents and I will reseed where needed.
Most of us want only the English (usually) Audio so I got the secondary tracks separately (demuxed).
