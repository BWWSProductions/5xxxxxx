,ze4502,2010-08-06T02:36Z,What program do you use to record the show?
[T],jwhitt62,2010-08-06T04:15Z,"The program I use is call RadioTime Redbutton. It costs $25 and you have to have a unique username and password to us it. The program is very reliable, so it might have been my computer or internet connection."
,ze4502,2010-08-06T04:59Z,Does the program come with a feature to strip the ads out? I've been looking for something to strip ads out but haven't found anything yet.
,ze4502,2010-08-16T21:42Z,How do you remove the ads?
