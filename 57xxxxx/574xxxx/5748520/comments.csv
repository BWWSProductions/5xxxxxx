I can't stand looking at this kind of software in the stores, with their extortionate price tags hanging round their shiny boxes. Makes me nauseous. You can just hear the kerching noise as Bill Gates' eyes light up with dollar bills."

plz help!!!"
,jbrrr,2010-09-22T03:55Z,"The serials work.  Make sure you enter:
The WORD serial when starting Word
The EXCEL serial when starting Excel
etc...

I never needed the 1st serial listed for office, but I only installed W,E & PP

Run the shell script first, it needs Apple Dev tools which can be downloaded and installed for free from Apple...  you just need to sign up for a Dev account...  or use the torrent linked in the comment above."
,Dannieloco,2010-09-22T13:05Z,does the nm patch work?
,melvindrbk,2010-09-23T04:11Z,"does this have an expiration date ? can i keep it? or after the final release comes out, its not going to work ? "
,Dannieloco,2010-09-23T13:34Z,"1. copy to Commend file to desktop (drag icon)
2. run terminal (Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal)
3. change to desktop folder ('cd Desktop')
4. make sure permissions are set on nm command ('chmod 755 nm')
5. run patch ('./MS\ Office\ 2011\ Mac\ Patch.command')
6. Run office and enter serials provided in the other torrent ;)

done!"
