A nice collection of books on espionage and intelligence including some well known titles by Tim Weiner,  Oleg Kalugin, Antonio J. Mendez, Jeffrey T. Richelson and Christopher Andrew.
A lot of reading but well worth it. 
All books are PDF with retail covers for thumbnail view, each one separately packed with WinRAR.
These are plain archives- no SFX, no viruses. Packing them saves me a lot of bandwidth in the long run. These are packed individually for your convenience- want one- grab one.

Two things:

RATE THE TORRENT

LOOK AT MY OTHER TORRENTS- good books on NSA, identity theft and industrial espionage. Worth downloading, you know ;)
