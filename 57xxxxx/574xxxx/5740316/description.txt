This is from the 20th Season, and was one of the 
last regular Red Skelton Shows on broadcast TV in 1971.

Red would take his act on the road for many years,
before doing a few specials for HBO in the early
1980s.

His guest here is James Drury of
"The Men from Shiloh", which was the final season
of "The Virginian".
