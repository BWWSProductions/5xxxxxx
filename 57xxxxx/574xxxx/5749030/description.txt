    When a crafty reporter uses false pretenses to get a story out of        
    heiress Tony Gateson, she turns the tables on him, telling the press     
    that she's engaged to him and that she's given him a million dollar      
    dowry. Suddenly he's on the front page and every salesman is at his      
    doorstep. He loses his job and a day later asks her to call off the      
    ruse; she tricks him again and the publicity continues. She stays        
    cheerful and resourceful through a series of misadventures that has      
    him alternately back on his job and fired. Meanwhile, a count who's      
    her ex-fianc shows up in New York, and maybe that marriage is back      
    on. Can an heiress be a human being, and can a reporter get a scoop?
