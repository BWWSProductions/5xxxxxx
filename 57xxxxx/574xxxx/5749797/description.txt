The Goo Goo Dolls are getting ready to release their ninth studio album, which should be available by the end of August.  If you donâ€™t want to wait that long to hear some new music from the band, you can download Waiting for the Rest of It from their website, or pick up the five song EP at one of their concerts this summer. Aptly titled, Waiting for the Rest of It is a preview of their album containing four new songs and a live version of their 1998 smash hit â€œBroadway.â€
Overall , this EP makes it that much harder to do just that, wait for the full length album to be released in late August.  If these four songs are any indication the rest of this album is going to be their best album in recent years.  Check out this rocking preview EP now, and then give the whole album a listen when itâ€™s released this month.
