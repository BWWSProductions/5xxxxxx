Here you go, the entire first season with music restored. DVD audio was used on parts where music isn't replaced. Some credit songs were sourced from better rips of the song.

note - alot of the episodes were re-done since the torrents were originally started, anything with a V2 on the filename is a new copy and I suggest grabbing it instead of your old copy.

enjoy
