Our Mother the Mountain is the second album by country singer/songwriter Townes Van Zandt released in 1969. It is generally acknowledged as his first masterpiece and although it sold little upon release, it initially influenced fellow Texas country singer/songwriters Butch Hancock and Jimmie Dale Gilmore who would soon form The Flatlanders along with Joe Ely.
