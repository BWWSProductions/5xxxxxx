[T],SgtRlee,2011-04-06T12:38Z,"Install the ""Media Player Classic"" player if you can't play this file, 
or for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. 
It's 100% free to download and use. Just updated January 31, 2011

[T],SgtRlee,2011-04-06T12:50Z,"S4E01 is cut short and is not the full episode 'because when it aired, Adult Swim broadcast the first 15 minutes twice over on the west coast, so whoever was cool enough to capture that first episode as it was being broadcast was not at fault, it was Adult Swim. 
This is one of my favorate shows and i was able to get the whole episode posted here in 1080p and the picture quality is fantastic!
