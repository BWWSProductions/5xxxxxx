,balanced,2010-10-24T01:02Z,Something isn't right with the english subtitles.  In VLC under Ubuntu Linux the subtitles work for a short while then suddenly stopped working until I toggled the subtitles off and then back on again and then they disappear after a short while again anyway.  Rebooted the machine into Vista and under VLC there the subtitles don't bother to show up at all.  Tried searching the net for an english .SRT file but nothing comes up.  too bad its' a nice copy but I have no choice but to download another one again.  Oh and by the way I've had this 'subtitles disappearing' problem occur with some other torrents too (although not all) so there is some setting that you guys are doing (in common) when you're encoding that is a fail.  Hope that helps.
