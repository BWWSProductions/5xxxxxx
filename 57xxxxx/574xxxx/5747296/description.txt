In ZOE2, players are once again thrown into an interplanetary conflict, but this time the stakes are even higher, as the fate of Jupiter and Mars are held in the balance. Players will find a host of new gameplay features to help balance the odds. Exhilarating new maneuvers enable players to swing around enemies, target and destroy swarms of enemy fighters, tear down walls to use as shields or as a weapon, and even teleport out of danger. There are also more sub-weapons that support basic attacks and enhance strategic play during combat.

The game's setting expands greatly beyond that of the first ZOE: battles will be fought in canyons, cityscapes, enemy fortresses and even in the depths of space. A new cast of characters populates these diverse settings, promising to infuse this epic saga with a human element.
