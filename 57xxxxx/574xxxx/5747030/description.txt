Herein lies the 8-cd box set "Zoltan Kocsis plays Bartok" by Philips. This set contains the solo piano works of Bela Bartok (although I've not organized them by CD; I've instead organized them by work).

Encoded in FLAC compression-level 5.





**Tagging is done as follows:
Artist == Composer
Album == Name of the work
Title == Title of a part or movement in a work
Genre == The performer(s)
Track == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.

I've done filenames as "%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title"



If there are any skips or pops in the files that I have missed, please comment and I will fix and upload that piece.
