,cmonroy,2010-08-24T08:53Z,"Magician is OK, but Silverthorn and Darkness are more like streamed text without paragraphs, chapters or other marks that ease reading. Haven't yet checked the others, but they'll probably need some heavy editing...
Maybe you can re-scan them and convert them to PDF?
I'll seed Duilsko, and thanks for your effort."
,duilsko,2010-08-31T10:44Z,"Sorry to hear that cmonroy, I am using stanza on my iphone to read them, and they are mostly fine.
I will have a look at doing them in pdf format and making a new torrent."
,Madaz13b,2010-09-19T04:36Z,"Im using ""Mobi pocket reader"".

cmonroy is right and also Demonwar Saga Book 1 wont load, also Serpentwar Saga book's 1,2 & 3 have the wrong covers, minor detail i know but i thought i would point it out, if you could fix these small problems that cmonroy and i have pointed out it would be a creat upload/torrent/collection to keep updated :D

ps. i highly recomend you do fix it and keep it up too date lol"
,Madaz13b,2010-09-19T05:17Z,"pss. i forgot one more thing, Legends book 2 cover is wrong it has book 3's cover"
,Madaz13b,2010-09-19T05:27Z,"Serpentwar 3 Rage of a Demon King, also has an editing problem, it continues pretty much without a break and makes it hard to read "
,azizex666,2011-04-24T18:09Z,Thx for the upload!
,dbuck53,2012-06-26T07:26Z,"duilsko, thank you for the upload in epub.  The format works best for me since I read on my laptop with Epubreader addon for Firefox.

I will happily struggle through the few badly formatted ones.  I tried myself to reformat and it is a real time-consuming pain to do just a few chapters."
