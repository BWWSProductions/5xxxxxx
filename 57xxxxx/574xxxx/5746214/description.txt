This is the official soundtrack of Victoria II, the newest strategy game from Paradox Entertainment. It includes the pre-order exclusive track "Lament for the Queen". 

Since it's a pre-order exclusive, once the game comes out, you may want to add it manually to your game directory's Music subdirectory, in order to hear it in-game along with the others!

This is my first torrent here! I figured that with the Canadian DMCA that might hit us soon, it's now or never! Write to your MP if you are in Canada to share your thoughts about it. If this bill was law, I could go to jail or be forced into bankruptcy for sharing this fine music with you!

Please help seed as I have a bandwidth limit that will kick in eventually :) I will share at full speed for as long as I can.

I encourage anyone with access to the Map, Manual and Strategy Guide that came with the pre-order to share it here as well. More importantly, I encourage anyone who enjoy Paradox' games to buy them if you are able to! They're one of the finest studios still in the business and they support their titles in an extraordinary fashion.

Thank you, and enjoy!!
