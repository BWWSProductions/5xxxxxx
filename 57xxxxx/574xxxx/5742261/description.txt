         n the last few years, the Red Planet has yielded up many      
         new clues that life may have once existed there...and may     
         even exist there today. There is now have proof that water    
         once flowed on the surface, that Mars once had lakes, and     
         that the frozen poles are mostly water, not carbon dioxide    
         as previously thought. Mars has snow--an aurora--and          
         lightning generated by dust storms. Most intriguing of all    
         are the seasonal plumes of methane that just may point to     
          bacteria living below the surface.
