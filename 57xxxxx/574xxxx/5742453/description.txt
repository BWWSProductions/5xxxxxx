Release Notes:
Right, thanks to relizlab for video and TA For audio, got some video off my russian friend same cam, but was only 700mb
so opted for the one with better bitrate , anyway tweaked all the colours mainly the red, gave it quite a bit of
brightness seemed pretty dark to me, slight change in contrast and saturation, now many of you would notice that the image
was pulling to the side, just used a simple filter in vdub to fix it, lost a bit of video not much, but looks better imo
audio ain't great but it's decent enough for this movie. Enjoy
