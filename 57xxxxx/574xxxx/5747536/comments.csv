,williamballs,2012-04-10T02:54Z,"i love how we get a bunch of useless information about your computer, but only a few rudimentary bits of info about the videos. thanks.

it says h.264 in the title and x264 in the description... which is it? also, what is the level on this video? 4.1? 5.1?

basically can i play this on ps3 without re-encoding the entire video?"
