Notes: 
# FLAC files have a silent LFE channel not present in the original 5.0 mix because I couldn't get it to encode any other way. It should not affect sound quality at all.

# Rear channel sound in "The Drapery Falls" is overlaid with "Harvest" at about half volume. This is an error in the original master.
