A wealthy widow's young boyfriend falls to his death, which turned out to be the result of poisoning. Lassiter quickly thinks that the widow (Jean Smart) is responsible, but Shawn and Gus believe that the victim was trained to be a con artist, by the guy (John Michael Higgins) who they think is the actual murderer. Shawn takes a different approach than usual to figure it out, but the case takes a turn for him. Also guest stars Lee Garlington.
