Quality: B-
Menu & Chapters (sorta)

The original source of this bootleg gave it an A- but they probably graded it back in the day of CRT. The video quality is grainy, very VHS like and the menu system is very primitive. However, it's still a really good bootleg with nearly solid audio. There are two or three times when the audio drops but only for a second or a two at a time.
