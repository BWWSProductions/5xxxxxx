Underwater Marine life is concerned with the plants, animals and other organisms that live in the ocean. For us, who dwell of the land, the underwater world is full of interest and intrigue. We may often sit on the beach and enjoy the ocean breeze, but the beauty at the depth of the ocean remains distant. We have explored the Ocean depths far and wide, but still there are things that are alien and unknown.

Underwater imaging is considered an especially challenging area of photography. Despite the difficulty, there is a possibility of many exciting and rare photographic opportunities. This drives men to the very depths of Oceans to capture the vivid colors of the underwater world.

 Marine Life Theme tries to bring the feel of the Ocean depths to your desktop. The theme consists of 35+ Hi-Res Wallpapers, Custom Fish Icons and select sounds for a totally âfishyâ experience on your Desktop. :) "
