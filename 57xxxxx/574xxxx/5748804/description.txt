Madison, WI-based emo quintet Paris, Texas formed in late 1997; originally comprising singer Scott Sherpe, guitarist Matt Managan and drummer Sam Vinz, the lineup quickly grew to include guitarist Nick Zinkgraf and bassist Matt Tennessen as well. Recording their 1998 debut demo with Rainer Maria's Kyle Fischer, Paris, Texas next surfaced on a split single with Baby I'm a Star before signing to Polyvinyl for a self-titled EP; the full-length So You Think It's Hot Here? followed in the autumn of 1999. Brazilliant was issued a year later.
