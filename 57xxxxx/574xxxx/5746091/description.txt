The Town Heroes: A two piece, alternative rock band consisting of Guitar + Drums. Energetic, skinny, Cape Bretonian marsupials with grey furry ears and coats; feeds on burgers, KD, toast and PB and J. Songs: an honest approach to the trials and tribulations of life, taking into consideration small town values, coming of age, intriguing people encountered, friendship, hope and the various conflicts that arise from a jobless island and its steady outflow of people.

Although minimalist in terms of numbers, their sound is anything but that. Self described as \"The most noise two Cape Bretoners can make\", that noise is a cascade or passion, urgency and belief in their songs.
