Clean torrent created for my bro Sean - no viruses or keyloggers.

Complete World of Warcraft 3.3.3a download. A version commonly used on private servers. 

Many people create an account on a private World of Warcraft server first. Many are ranked at http://www.xtremetop100.com/world-of-warcraft.
Then they edit the realmlist.wtf file with notepad and set the realmlist to that of the private server they wish to play.

The realmlist.wtf may be found in the data/enUS folder. 

***** BE SURE TO PLAY USING THE WOW.EXE AND NOT THE LAUNCHER.EXE AS THIS WILL PATCH YOU PAST 3.3.3a. *****

I know some private servers are playing 3.3.5 and other versions. You can patch to that if you want or find another torrent.

Good Luck, and enjoy.
