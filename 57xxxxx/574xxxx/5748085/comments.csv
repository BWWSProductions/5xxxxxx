,Adrenergia,2010-08-09T11:20Z,"@zmacdaddy8:look mate, the pirate pay is a source for all kinds of content,including religious books,porn!,movies,software..This is just another book; if you wish to read in it it's up to you..If you don't it's up to you,,You have a FREE WILL!

As for the so called ""holes and mistakes"", I CHALLENGE you to name one OR write anything like the Quran.

And the part of ""moon good cult"" is rather amusing than provoking. Do you think over 1 Billion person on the planet dance when the moon is full...LOL!

as for our insults to our prophet..it means nothing..bring real proof from a credible source of what you claimed..this is the scientific method.other than that it's just ramblings from a person full with hatred.

@dirtyjews: although I find your name quite offending to the jewish people, I appreciate your support.Thanks"

If you read in any history book you will find that Prophet mohammad (peace be upon him) had actually many wives during his life. I have no idea where did you get this false weird idea..you know many of his people didn't believe him like you but they said the usual stuff like ""you are a wizard""  ""you made this up""
 ""you are a crazy man""..but a CHILD MOLESTER!!!Seriously????"
,Metalsucks,2010-08-26T04:13Z,"All the holes in that (""piece"" be upon it) of sh!t called Koran, check this site:

skepticsannotatedbible -dot- com/quran/index.htm

AND SPEAKING OF WHICH, CHECK THAT NEW CHANNEL ""Qanat Al Hayat"" which is disproving the koran more than ever, made by ex-muslims"

Don't make me laugh :D
You wonder why people write comments with such colourful language and attitude, well its simply because they are angered by all the blind falsehood that is preached.
Oh and for the talk of 'scientific method', you couldn't know science if it came up and smacked you in the face!
Case in point - Dawkin's in Ch4's  'Faith School Menace' interviewing girl's in a so-called school in Leicester, watch - you'll see lol :D
Islamic face coverings - Viva la France!"

You wonder why people react with such colourful language to yours and others religion?? Well, its simply because they are angered by all the falsehood that these ficticious books preach.
Oh and talking about 'scientific method', ah-ah - you wouldn't know science even if it came up and smacked you in the face!!  NB.  Watch Dawkin's in Ch4's 'Faith School Menace', talking to a group of girl students in a so-called school in Leicester.  Watch its hilarious :D
