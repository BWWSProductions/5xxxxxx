Metallica / Kill Em All

This is the original Elektra release, which contains two extra tracks, 'Am I Evil', and 'Blitzkrieg'. This is ripped from the first issue CD, so you probably expect what quality these will be.

These were all ripped by me using CDex/Lame/320kbps.

01 - Hit The Lights
02 - The Four Horsemen
03 - Motorbreath
04 - Jump In The Fire
05 - (Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth
06 - Whiplash
07 - Phantom Lord
08 - No Remorse
09 - Seek And Destroy
10 - Metal Militia
11 - Am I Evil?
12 - Blitzkrieg 

Metallica Trivia: According to Wikipedia, Hammett has apologized for the unusual pitch of the string bend which occurs in Seek And Destroy at 3:47 to 3:48, during the solo, saying that it is in fact a mistake or "bum note".
