Storyline: 

It was the darkest of times in China, when ruthless warlords waged battles to satiate their endless aggression. 
Millions of lives perished, and those who survived had only two choices - kill or be killed .The battalions of 
warring states Liang and Wei collided in a bloodbath that lasted from dawn until dusk. Only two men were left 
standing - a foot soldier from Liang and the rival General from Wei. The Soldier survived because he is an expert 
in playing dead, with a device strapped on his body which protruded like an arrowhead for added realism.
The Soldier captured the wounded General, hoping to use the enemy as his ticket to freedom - by handing the General
to the Liang warlord, the Soldier could be honorably discharged and return home to his peaceful life. The young General, 
though taken captive, was condescending towards the Soldier. The two men were often at loggerheads during the long and
winding journey
