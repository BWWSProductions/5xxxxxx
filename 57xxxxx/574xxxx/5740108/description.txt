These are al the HD-TV XVID rips from Eureka Season 3, so this is NOT a DVDRIP. Al of them downloaded and available on the Piratebay but I couldn't find the whole season in one upload.

As the file is over 6gb and I'm the only one seeding it downloading will be slow in the beginning but I will seed 24/7 nonstop. Please bear that in mind.
