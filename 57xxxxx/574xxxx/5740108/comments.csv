,dedutch,2010-08-05T02:10Z,Made a little mistake so had to re-upload. Sorry for any inconvenience.
,dedutch,2010-08-06T19:31Z,"I know that most people have at least uploaded 1:1 when they finished downloading but I really need some people willing to seed it for longer if this torrent is to survive.

So please don't delete the torrent from your bittorrent client and keep seeding once you're done downloading, the community thanks you.

,dubisz,2010-08-07T13:36Z,"Please seed! Got 93,9% and it's stalled. I'm gonna seed it a long time, once I've got the whole thing."
,RandomEvent,2010-08-07T23:37Z,"Seems a lot want this, but missing seeds."
,dacarlo,2010-08-09T09:44Z,"There's 4 seeds I can see and a smeg load of peers stuck on 95.1%

Once that last 4.9% gets fed through there should be enough seeds."
,scruggle,2010-08-09T14:22Z,Lot of people stuck at 95.1% please finish seed this!
,dedutch,2010-08-17T01:06Z,"I just got back from holiday thinking I'll have at least uploaded 50 gigs but my PC crashed. Thats the reason you pirates didnt get the full file.

I'm really sorry!!!! I've got the torrent up and running again.

Sorry again!"
,pro_torr,2010-10-22T08:30Z,You're missing episode 19 where Carter and Tess break up.
,tlchack5,2010-10-23T07:40Z,@ pro_torr. Spoiler alert. Thanks a-hole. Haven't seen that episode but Netflix didn't have episode 13 as watch instantly for some reason and I didn't want to wait for it to come in the mail so I'm grabbing it here. I didn't even know they got together yet. Even if its a joke your still an jackass.
,dedutch,2010-10-23T16:22Z,"Instead of a thank you (haven't even received one btw) pro_torr decided to fuck around....there is no such thing as a 19th episode.

neither IMDB nor Amazon nor any other vendor has a 19th episode on the DVD of season 3!"
,Hellvamp,2010-12-10T11:20Z,"Man, thanks a lot! Really nice torrent :) 

I'll help seeding as much as I can!

Thanks again, and pro_torr you're such aa asshole!"
,carlosritchie,2011-02-23T23:27Z,"can more people please seed im only getting 20kbps and ive watched season 2 and dying to get into this season

,Chryssta,2011-09-23T19:29Z,"Uh, episode 9 kinda doesn't play past the opening credits. Got another one you can upload?"
,Chryssta,2011-09-23T19:38Z,"Sorry, nevermind, it loads and plays just fine in Final Media Player (I don't like VLC)."
