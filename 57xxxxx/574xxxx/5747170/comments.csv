,asighkick,2010-08-10T04:26Z,"Hi,

I already have a copy of this season and am wondering whether or not you will revitalise S01 of X Factor or not?

Several of your torrents are still active and I grabbed them just in case they disappeared forever.  They are:

The.X.Factor.s01.e01.Auditions
The.X.Factor.s01.e05.Auditions
The.X.Factor.s01.e08.Judges.Homes
The.X.Factor.s01.e09.Top.9.Results
The.X.Factor.s01.e11.Top.7.Results
The.X.Factor.s01.e14.Top.4.Results

Also looking for Xtra factor for the first three seasons.

Thanks in advance."
[V],verovenlo,2010-08-12T03:31Z,yes i will start tommorow ok
,asighkick,2010-08-12T04:35Z,"Thanks a million verovenlo.....

I have a very slow connection over here in NZ and therefore there is no reason to hurry.  One episode every two or three days will be more than adequate, especially since X & Xtra Factor Series 6 is due to start before the end of August.  

Auditions for X Factor started in June - Dannii Minogue is having a baby and Cheryl Cole has been excused due to a stress related illness.  We will see stand-in Judges including Natalie Imbruglia, Pixie Lott, Katy Perry and we also have a new Xtra Factor presenter Konnie Hug."
,asighkick,2010-08-12T07:15Z,"Edit:  Should have said, X Factor Series 7 ... it actually starts on Saturday 21st August @ 8.30pm UK time."
