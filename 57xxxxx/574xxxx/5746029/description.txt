Home distilling is a rewarding hobby that combines skills as diverse as cooking, zymurgy, plumbing, chemistry and thermodynamics. Although it takes no great skill to whip up a batch of 'shine, this is a hobby that can be taken to great depths. The author has made a comprehensive guide to producing top-notch corn whiskey using hardware-store materials. The purity of the product produced using the methods he describes far outstrips any that Grampaw could have made with his old thumper. The author's approach is very informative, without going overboard on technical detail. It is quite readable and should be considered a must-have for anyone looking into the hobby. Bear in mind, though, this is an instructional manual, so it isn't sprinkled with amusing anecdotes or breezy prose. It is simply a perfect 'how-to' manual.
