1995s Dear You finds Jawbreaker cleaning up and streamlining their sound and coming up with a sleek, slick punk-grunge classic that relies as much on clever songwriting and restrained emotions as it does on the groups trademarked high-energy attack.  Along with Weezers Blue Album, Dear You is one of the cornerstones upon which emo and late 90s punk-pop were built. Certainly Jimmy Eat World wore out their copy, as Bleed American sounds like a less produced younger brother, and Dashboard Confessionals whole oeuvre sounds like a lesser version of Dear Yous acoustic Unlisted Track.  Dear You is one of the best rock records of the 90s and a fitting last testament to a great band.
