Maybe in the future ..... not sure though

@ Seeder

If I find good source links I will do it
Problem is the quality of old shows is not good & on encoding to a smaller size will not get a good result

@ usgh

Sorry not in the near future

,YankeeStrudel,2010-09-30T02:43Z,After viewing all 20 episodes - don't waste your time with this torrent it is a botched job - unless you know how to tweek the settings.   RiddlerA dl's should be avoided.

[T],FatFreddy39,2011-06-21T02:52Z,"Thanks for the upload Riddler, great quality by the way. On a humorous note I actually started watching Fringe because of you Riddler. I read a comment you posted saying you weren't gonna do Dexter or something but you recommended Fringe. So thank you for getting me on this series indirectly lol."
,Dumkovski,2011-06-25T10:16Z,Great job - people bagging this torrent - you need to have a look at yourselves and the systems you're using to play it on.
