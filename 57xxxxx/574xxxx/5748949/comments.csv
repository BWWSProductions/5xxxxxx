,atnas1010,2010-10-29T02:47Z,What player are you using?
,KirkBauer,2010-11-08T16:00Z,"Before downloading the monolithic torrent, I pulled one episode from USENET, and I can't find the original, ""real"" special effects either. There's only one video stream in the MKV, and according to both mkvinfo and VLC it times out at 50:34. While I don't doubt they might be there somewhere, I sure as blazes can't find 'em.

If anyone knows of any high-def episodes of the original Star Trek as-aired without the recently-added computer-cartoon not-so-special effects, please point to 'em, thanks."
,thorofdenmark,2010-11-09T13:50Z,I dont get it ..my MPC just plays the remaster and that's it!!
,atnas1010,2010-11-19T14:17Z,what KirkBauer said :)
,rafael.eti.br,2010-12-03T04:32Z,"On any player, the Haali Spliter icon (awhite icon) should appear (it can be disabled through settings) on the system tray. Right click it and it right at the end of the menu you should see the list of editions where you will find the original one.

On the MPC it can also be done by right clicking anywhere, then go to the Filter menu, the last filter on the list should be the Haali Spliter (although it will show the name of the file instead of Haali Splitter). Go there and at the very end you should see it."

Um...that assumes one has it installed, or even knows it is required for these files. And it doesn't work on, ""any player,"" since I routinely use VLC to view MKV files, and want to play these on a PBO Core where it's impossible to run Haali Media Spliter.

> Right click it and it right at the end of the menu you should see the list of editions

Correct, once HMS is installed, one can play the original episode via WMP, and I thank you for that information. Now is it possible to split out that edition only into a separate MKV file for playback in a set-top (more accurately a set-beside) box?

(Running to Scroogle to start searching for information on ""editions..."")"
,KirkBauer,2011-05-29T03:32Z,"I don't suppose we can get any seeders for this? The USENET versions of these seem to be corrupt after episode 10, and even though I can currently see a bunch of peers (over twenty), there are no seeds."
,rafael.eti.br,2011-06-01T06:01Z,"Wow some how I got back to this page!

Since I am here, I shall comment.

You are right, I should have said most not any.

Yes, VLC uses built-in codec and there is no way for it to use external codecs (I hate it for that, but it is multi-plataform, so I guess it is realated to this the reason why it doesn't use external codecs), but I believe it also uses haali spliter internally, so there may be a way to choose the edtion in it (MPC (or Media Player Classic) also has some built-in codec (but also has the option to use external codec which I prefer) and haali splitter is one of them, so it probably is the same for the VLC (I don't have it here right now so I can't check it). I mean, one way o another, every one ends up using haali splitter even if they don't state it. The quest is if the version in use has support for this and if there is a option to select it.

I did download it from the usenet, but it probably was also corrupt or otherwise I won't have come here in other to fill the missing pieces.

I still have the files (haven't remuxed them yet) so I should be able to upload, but with my crap upload speed and the size of this, I probably won't bother, sorry."
