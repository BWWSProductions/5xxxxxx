,tomthu2,2010-08-08T16:21Z,Can't use a magnet link because it is unsupported in the version of transmission used on my Freenas server and my server does all the downloading.

,Triplehammer,2010-08-17T21:57Z,"Just so you all know, NBC is doing weird shit with the rest of the episodes:

Episode 10 will air on TV August 21 (they skipped a week).

Episode 11 will not be aired on TV, but will only show up online, probably at nbc.com (click ""Shows"" and ""Persons Unknown"").  Hopefully this doesn't confuse the release scene too much.

The 2 hour finale, episodes 12 and 13, will air on TV on August 28.

Persons Unknown was never intended to be more than one season and it was all shot and done in early 2009, so the finale will be a real one with all questions answered, and the ratings have nothing to do with how quickly it ends."
