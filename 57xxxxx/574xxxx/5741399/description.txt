V-VIII-MMX


Well, here it is.  My very first house remix.  By no means perfect (or complete) however I thought I would release it to get some feedback and comments.  I love this track to death.  The Daft Punk hook in it is sick.  This is my tribute to the upcoming Tron Legacy soundtrack and film. 

Hopefully there will be more to come soon.  Don\\\'t forget n.a.K House Mix XV is currently in the works and due for release this month so stay tuned.  Enjoy people!
