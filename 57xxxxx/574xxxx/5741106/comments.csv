With the money you spent you could buy the best Apple machine in commerce or pay a Linux class."
,tackfurlo,2010-08-10T22:02Z,"As someone who runs a custom built, stripped down, secured Linux box (running firefox within a second Linux VM, native box doesn't even have HTTP support, too vulnerable...) I'd just like to say that, while Linux is a MUCH smaller target than Windows, the truth is, if it has a NIC, a USB port, or any way to connect to anything except maybe a solar panel for electricity (powerline network hacking is suprisingly easy...) it's vulnerable.  As such, even if you're on Linux, you should still run AV.  Right now, my system idles at over 23% CPU using from all the security tools I have running, but try to remember: modern machines are dual core monstrosities.  If you cannot afford to spend 20% CPU on keeping the system safe, just run Windows 2000 with no firewall or AV and give up.

Not trying to be an ass or anything, but only a complete and total n00b would think that Linux alone provides automatic invulnerability.  It's a step in the right direction, a giant leap maybe, but the sad truth is I know 4 0days for RedHat and 2 for Debian that are over 5 years old and still not patched.  You think your Linux box is impervious just because it's Linux?  Give me an IP and we'll fine out."
