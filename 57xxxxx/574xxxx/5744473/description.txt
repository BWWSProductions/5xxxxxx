Release notes:

Atlantic Records has announced the upcoming release of AVATAR Music From The
Motion Picture Music Composed And Conducted By James Horner the official score
album companion to 20th Century Fox's hugely anticipated 3-D sci-fi
action-adventure. The album, which features music composed and conducted by
Academy Award-winner James Horner (Titanic, A Beautiful Mind, An American Tail),
will be released physically on December 15th. Avatar arrives in theatres
everywhere on December 18th.

Written and directed by Academy Award-winner James Cameron (Titanic, Aliens, The
Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, True Lies, The Abyss), Avatar takes us
to a spectacular new world beyond our imagination, where a reluctant hero
embarks on a journey of redemption and discovery as he leads a heroic battle to
save a civilization. Cameron first conceived the film 14 years ago, when the
means to realize his vision did not yet exist. Now, after four years of actual
production work, Avatar delivers a fully immersive cinematic experience of a new
kind, where the revolutionary technology invented to make the film disappears
into the emotion of the characters and the sweep of the story.
