[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-08T01:45Z,@ TKOG11 - I am uploading S01 to the seedbox right now. I will upload it in the next 16 hours. I am getting the other seasons. As soon as I get each season I will encode it and then upload it. (^_^)

Please check out some HR or OOO releases for reference, those always have perfect ratios ;)"
