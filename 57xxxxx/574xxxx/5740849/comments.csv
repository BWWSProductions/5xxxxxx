   Time For Annihilation. On the Record, and On The Road

   Papa Roach wage war every time they pick up their instruments. It's a war for
   musical integrity. It's a war for their fans. It's a war for rock 'n' roll.
   The California quartets latest release, Time for Annihilation. On The Record
   and On The Road captures that war on stage and in the studio, showcasing nine
   live renditions of Papa Roach classics and five newly recorded tracks.
