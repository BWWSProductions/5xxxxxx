V 7 A 9 looks brilliant!

Anyone seen links to subtitles yet? lookin myself, hopin to see some soon!"
,McfcDan,2010-08-06T18:09Z,"Is this version by any chance better than the XVID Kingdom and XVID IMAGINE by any chance? 

I usually just download the latest copies but my monitor is broke, so I'm having to use the laptop on wireless, so it'd be pointless of me downloading this copy with no difference whatsoever.

Could anyone please tell me if it's better picture or audio quality than the two I mentioned? Cheers in advance, there is no negativity towards this version by the way."

,emma5186,2010-08-07T10:14Z,what are the subs for ??? is the A in english?? gonna d/l and seed for a while. thanks uploader  remember ppl seed its the only right thing to do
,wilywondr,2010-08-07T20:48Z,"emma5186: There are sections of the movie where Russian is spoken, so English subtitles are needed. Almost all of the movie is spoken in English however. 
Thanks for the upload raymondhome and thanks for the subtitle link nitestalker."
,Meatus,2010-08-08T19:04Z,Thanks for the posting Ray.  Here's my two cents on it though.  Movie is watchable.  Kinda dark in the early scenes and needs English subtitles.  I haven't finished it yet b/c of the subtitles.
,pacocrowley,2010-08-09T02:31Z,"It's always nice to see a torrent with all the info you need, thanks."
,catch311,2010-08-09T09:01Z,"V 6 A 4 M 7
Sound would be stereo for one minute then mono for the next half hour.  Plus sometimes you couldn't hear them talk at all.  I couldn't get the subs to match up so the Russian speaking parts were lost to me. The Video also looked to be cut in a few scenes, but that could have been the movie too.  But thanks for sharing it and letting us see what we won't pay to see.  You're the best Raymond!"
,Lassik,2010-08-09T10:44Z,"Ok so this quality is crap. Sorry. It jumps around a lot and there are some pretty serious parts which are in Russian. It really ruins the plot without the subtitles.

The subtitles posted in the comments here are just for the English parts which is retarded because it's a horrible translation. Whoever put together those subtitles sucked more dick than a Hungarian whore.  

Does anyone have a link to subtitles for the Russian parts? This movie really is unwatchable without them.

The audio goes in and out and all of the sudden the scene will change. One part show her on top of a truck and then without any notice, she's on top of a completely different truck."
,Lassik,2010-08-09T10:47Z,Damn it! I'm so fucking pissed that I watched this shit all the way up to the damn end and a majority of the fucking end is entirely in Russian with no subtitles!
,darkrose6,2010-08-09T14:29Z,Thanks Ray!
,Jack_Reacher,2010-08-10T02:57Z,"The quality was as good as anything you'll stream from Netflix.  Too bad the movie was so fucking unbelievable that it actually sucked.  All they're looking for is Salt 2, Salt 3 yadda yadda.

v8/a7

Thanks for the up."
,pixman83,2010-08-10T13:47Z,"Better subs: http://subscene.com/english/Salt/subtitle-352297.aspx

It actually has english WHEN THEY AREN'T SPEAKING ENGLISH!!!

It goes in and out of sync periodically, but its functional enough."
,omega45,2010-08-11T08:41Z,"Hi Raymondhome, again another upload that I gave you the benefit of the doubt, and, listened to your other comments, (and I do realize this are free) but, the A & V is not what everyone is saying it is......

,timmyp78,2010-08-11T16:39Z,"omega45,

,emperor2012,2010-08-13T17:32Z,"hey.........When I play videos, my screen goes black for a second...?
a strange thing is happening to my screen. Every time I go to play a video, the screen goes black for a second. Same thing when I close the video... black screen. 
It worked OK, then I had to reinstall windows and now every time I play a vid, I get a black screen.
Any ideas?
thanks in advance"
,Chunna_Dogg,2010-08-14T03:44Z,Magic dvdrip does the job nicely
,TehAgent,2010-08-14T16:19Z,"Film starts out dark, some scenes are cut from early in the film, sound is tinny, but during the first half goes waaay out of sync for around 1min, Russian speaking parts have no subtitles so you can not understand what they are saying (unless you speak Russian of course) over all a bad effort. free or not have some pride in your work.

Audio 5 / Video 5"

,parasites,2010-08-17T08:52Z,"Warning.
Do not click on Party Poker. 
It puts Antimalware Doctor on your computer. Antimalware Doctor is  rogue anti-spyware, a total scam. It will give you nothing but trouble. It stops you from using your computer. Also Party Poker puts this a annoying popup on your screen when your on the net.
I have a few computers and how I know its coming through facebook is thats the only site my daughter goes on. and its only that coumpter thats infected."

,yyesiwill4u,2010-08-20T03:28Z,"Not worth downloading.
Video is too poor not to be a major distraction.
You got an early release - big effing deal.
Almost 6000 downloads - don't people even bother to view the samples?
Big props to the uploader for bothering to include a sample so I didn't waste my time on the full download.
Those who don't like my negative comment are cordially invited to eat a dick."
