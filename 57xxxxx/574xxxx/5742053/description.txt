PrisM NOTES:
Right....late on this one been busy, anyway increased the brightness, slightly changed contrast, changed the saturation, tweaked the rgb colours around, giving it slight green lowering red, etc used a deblock filter, slight smoothness filter
and a sharpness filter, audio is from Krackerman Thanks mate apreciated. The video is missing around 2minutes, but also contains footage not in any of the audio we have, or on previous cams, it's about 40seconds in all, but...nothing can do about it.
