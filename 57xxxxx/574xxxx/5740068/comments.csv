,cap1985,2010-08-05T12:41Z,"Hi The_Day_Walker,

I'd be glad if you do some Tenacious D (Pick of Destiny) and more Disney stuff (e.g. classic Alice, Pinocchio, Mary Poppins).

Have a nice day ;)"
,cap1985,2010-08-05T15:35Z,"I forgot my fav movie ""Garden State"", could you do this please?

THX!"
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-05T20:55Z,@ cap1985 -  I just downloaded Garden State. I will encode it in a few hours and upload it tomorrow. Also I am working on several Disney movies.
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-05T21:01Z,"@ cap1985 - - - Also I will do Tenacious D (Pick of Destiny), in a few days."
,TKOG11,2010-08-06T00:15Z,can you please up entourage season 1-6 and all the new season's episodes as they come out?
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-06T00:58Z,"In a couple of hours I will upload Undergrads Complete Series.  I think I might go ahead and upload Tekken (the movie), cuz it is just awesome!!!   I just finished watching it again and it's already been tested.

@ TKOG11 - I would be more than happy to upload all of Entourage. I have already encoded Season 1, I just have to test it, and then I will upload it."
,TKOG11,2010-08-06T01:43Z,"@The_Day_Walker thanks man thats awesome, i really appreciate all of your hard work, especially now that HR is gone, PT uploads very view movies, and OOO is going on vacation"
,cap1985,2010-08-06T07:28Z,"@The_Day_Walker - Looking forward to Tekken, Tenacious D & Garden State THX

If you do some Disney stuff, please do the classic Alice first, because I didn't like the 2010 one :)

Either way, have a nice weekend :)"

,5T4LkER,2010-08-08T06:51Z,"@The_Day_Walker | I'm looking for all seasons of The Simpsons, preferably encoded for PSP... I can't seem to find a torrent with all of them, just 1 or 2 seasons. Can you upload such a torrent?"
[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-08T07:21Z,"@ 5T4LkER - Yes, I will gladly upload them for PSP, iPod, Zune, but it will take some time!  By the way, I test everything that I encode on 4 of my PSP s running official and custom firmware before I upload them. (^_^)"
