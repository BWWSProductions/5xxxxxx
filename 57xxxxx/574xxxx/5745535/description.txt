Swots is a comedy quiz for BBC Radio Scotland that puts the contestants 

back into the schoolroom circa 1965. Presenter Miles Jupp presides over the 

class of unruly celebrity pupils, with the aid of classroom assistant, the 

inimitable stand up Susan Morrison.

www.comedy.co.uk Review: 
[quote]A very patchy, bizarre series. Some is rather funny; everyone on the 

panel is clearly having fun and Jupp delivers some good (scripted) gags.

But there are parts of the show that lead one to really question the 

production team's mental processes. A good example of this is the quick-

fire maths round. Which, unfortunately, really does involve what the name 

suggests[/quote]
