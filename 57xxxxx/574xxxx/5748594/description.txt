Description 	
Takemoto Takeru, an ordinary high schooler, encounters a strange light during a bike delivery for his part time job. When he stops and searches the surrounding forest, he observes a cute girl, Hikari, climbing out of a sparkling cocoon. Takeru falls in love with her at first sight, but a monster appears in the same area and attacks the girl.

Kono Mini describes the exciting days Takeru spends with the mysterious girl Hikari; Akari, a girl he meets later; his childhood friend Nishino Mari; and his classmates.

These are just ordinary days, but from Hikari's point of view, they are wonderful.
