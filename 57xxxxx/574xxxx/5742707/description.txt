2010 collection. Familiar to millions yet still relatively unknown, the bands cover versions of '80s Post Punk classics have been heard on literally 100's of TV ad's and program sound beds in the UK alone. Not to mention starring roles in many a Hollywood soundtrack spanning blockbusters like Angelina Jolie's A Mighty Heart to cult classics like Tarantino's Grindhouse. The bands debut album 'Nouvelle Vague' went silver (60,000) in the UK and the band have gone on to sell over 750,000 units worldwide all from word of mouth with very little advertising or marketing. 15 tracks. Peacefrog.
