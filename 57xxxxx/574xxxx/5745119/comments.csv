On the other hand, HelloNewman's torrent is just a rip from TV. But then again, I prefer the better picture quality. So I go for HelloNewman's torrent. Thanks anyway."
,puppyup,2011-02-16T18:11Z,Forget my last comment. I guess I mixed up this release with another.

A/9:V/8"
,mizhop,2011-08-03T22:26Z,"Actually, yes, the subs included do cover the Sioux speech, but they are also for the English parts as well.  It would have been nice if there were subs for just the non-English parts (and I've looked elsewhere to no avail, sadly), but hey, it's free.

Thanks to the uploader and seeders!"
