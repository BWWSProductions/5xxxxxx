,lolsallama,2010-08-11T13:56Z,Avoid this - Reason is its not individual tracks but one LONG track for each CD so you cant take out tracks you dont want or easy skip to anything you want.
,Emporiooo,2010-08-11T20:03Z,@lolsallama I think I'll avoid you instead. LRN2 .CUE

,Glasgow76,2010-08-12T18:33Z,is there an easy program i could use to split the tracks?
,Crazy_Water,2010-08-13T22:51Z,"Its hassle, but I wanted this album, so I used Nero to create a virtual CD image, and then mounted that on a virtual drive, and used Media Player to rip it track for track, with correct album information too. Whoever thought that uploading it this was a clever idea was clearly high on something, I reckon."

,Vanz_,2010-09-01T06:24Z,"Far out, learn to use cue files guys.
The problem with this upload is the quality not the way it's uploaded.
VBR?! Avg 193? Thats fairly appauling."
,trasder,2011-04-22T08:48Z,"Anyone who wants to get the tracks split and have ID3's without burning to CD will need to first use

http://www.afterdawn.com/software/audio_video/audio_editing/mp3directcut.cfm

to split and overlay .cue, then export ('save split') but this results in broken ID3's that itunes wont read, so then use 

http://www.mp3tag.de/en/download.html

just open up all the songs and select ""save tags"" and it will repair them, now Itunes will read and organise for you.

technique working on win7, goodluck and rate highly, great upload"
