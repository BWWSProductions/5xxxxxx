Great quality!
Nice work m8!"
,moshster,2010-08-23T01:36Z,CABAC = No :(  Please can you encode with CABAC = Yes so that these files will stream with PS3 Media Server.  I've found that PS3 Media Server has issues streaming when CABAC is not used.
[V],poppedtart,2010-08-25T03:15Z,"sounds retarded to me.  cabac makes for compatibility issues with apple tv since it requires more CPU to decode.  use a different streaming software.  Your streaming software sounds mildly retarded, complain to the author.
