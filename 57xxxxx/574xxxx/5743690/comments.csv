,scotty35,2010-08-13T19:30Z,"There was a NFS hot pursuit 2 released a few years back for PC and PS2, the new one is called NFS hot pursuit, and judging by the file size i'd say this was the old one."

,jamesensor,2010-08-18T04:26Z,"What i would like to see around is a lan free game with a ui to run the game, like the one made for c&c zero hour mp. It would be awesome... because every pc as to have a diferent cd key to run :S, so there's a lot of time wasted installing, imputing cd keys, cd cd check, etc.. :(:(:("
,Lowsden,2010-08-30T15:39Z,"I did it but when I click on ""Play"" it's says me ""Please insert the correct CD-ROM, select OK and opena again this application""!! What I can do???"
,roadsinlife32,2010-09-22T23:36Z,"All right lets clarify for all you who dont seem to get this Need for Speed III had the subtitle Hot Pursuit. A few years later a sequel was made to that Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2, which is contained in this torrent. This year EA announced Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit witch releases in November. The more you know."
