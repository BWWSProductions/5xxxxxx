,wazz000,2010-08-19T17:11Z,"Ur welcome yesiamaduck :D

I hope every1 seeds once they have downloaded :D"
,yesiamaduck,2010-08-26T20:07Z,"Yeah, seeding 24/7... I'm in August now and beasides one of the Raws in May I think where it is unwatchable (at least on the xbox due to audio issues) it's great :) 

Any chance of 98 soon :O "
,wazz000,2010-08-27T01:21Z,"yes of course i will up others very soon :D. 

What is the date for the may raw that has audio issues on xbox 360. Ill check it out

BTW u r playin the files on xbox 360 or xbox 1"
,yesiamaduck,2010-08-27T15:10Z,"It's the 19th May, the audio is fine sorry but the video is running at a very odd frame rate on the xbox360. Meaning the audio is shooting ahead, although it seems to be okay on the pc."
,wazz000,2010-08-27T18:44Z,"I jus played that file on my xbox 360 and it played fine. No Audio/Video issues. R u sure its ""WWF.Monday.Night.Raw.05.19.97""

The only prob i had is when ever i fast forward on xbox 360. It stops playin. But when i play it again it plays fine

U can always watch that ep on pc or laptop or burn to dvd using Convert x to dvd :D"
,pinknikki,2010-08-31T03:50Z,"Hell Yeah! It may not of been where I started watching but it's kind of like watching the prologue to it!

Please upload the 1998 season! I'd love to watch the first ever episodes I caught again. (The Raw after In Your House when Kane debuted) I was hooked from then until the WCW merger and everything started sucking.

(Will seed as much as possible until 1998 hits)"
,OILFAN79,2010-09-21T21:47Z,"thanks alot, the new wwe doesnt compare to this"
,greatone88,2010-09-22T22:14Z,"Amazing! Attitude Era = best ever! i didnt start watching til right after WM14 so this is great to see the beginning of the Attitude. 

You would be my hero if you uploaded 98/99 RAW and SD. I am seeding this and will seed those as well!!"
,zabtyson,2010-09-26T22:51Z,"the first ep i download from here took about 15-20 min total.  now they are taking over 2 hours for each one.  did something happen cause it still says about the same number of leechers and seeders that it did the first time.  also when can we expect the 98 raws to be up

thanks a lot for putting them up "
,greatone88,2010-09-27T08:37Z,"just finished watching the last episode of 97, I NEED TO SEE MORE!!

,Stat1x,2011-05-30T17:09Z,"I was so happy when I found these torrents of yours so that I could finaly watch the Attitude Era (which I've only seen a very small part of).
