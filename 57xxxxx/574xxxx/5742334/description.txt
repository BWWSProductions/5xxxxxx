PrisM NOTES:
Right, thanks to relizlab for video and TA For audio, got some video off my russian friend same cam, but was only 700mb so opted for the one with better bitrate :), anyway tweaked all the colours mainly the red, gave it quite a bit of brightness seemed pretty dark to me, slight change in contrast and saturation, now many of you would notice that the image was pulling to the side, just used a simple filter in vdub to fix it, lost a bit of video not much, but looks better imo audio ain't great but it's decent enough for this movie.

credit PrisM & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
