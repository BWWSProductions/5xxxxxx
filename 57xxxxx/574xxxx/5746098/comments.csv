,Pbaby,2011-10-11T01:50Z,"I have read the game and have applied its teachings so many times with girls. It works unbelievably well. I also use some of it to mentor students I teach. One of them just got his first kiss. If you read the book, you will realise it is not about lines. It is really about 'inner game': having the confidence to be the best person you can be and then sharing that with girls you want to meet but might have been too shy or too awkward to speak to before. What is wrong with that? 

I wish I'd have read this when I was 16.

P.s.@ Macimate. I did wake up and smell the coffee, just after the gorgeous girl I had slept with made it for me.

P.p.s. @ Macimate. Forgetting the fact that religion is bullshit, what's wrong with being a bald jew?"
