This upload is for completing http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5715635/Beavis__amp__Butt-head___The_Complete_King_Turd_Collection_V2

After a reboot and recheck of that torrent, .1% of DVD16 went \"missing\"...  I re ripped the dvd, and the same thing happened, so I remade the torrent.  for those downloading priorly, just point this download to the same directory and files.

Message from KingTurd:

Hi Bungholes!

This is the 2nd Edition of my B&B collection. It has some improvements, e.g. approx. 35 episodes are in much better quality
than before (using recently obtained hi-qual no-logo VHS captures) and the menus are a bit \"enhanced\"...or something. Anyway, I thought it\'s a good opportunity to update it again, since some
of the demonoid trackers have died and the torrents needed to be uploaded all over again anyway. As always, please keep in mind: 

The KingTurd DVD-Collection is PUBLIC DOMAIN! Please keep it shared!!

If I see my collection anywhere on sale, I\'m gonna find you and beat the living crap out of you...or something! 
Seriously....respect my efforts in stitching this series back together and continue my mission of making this set available without profit to all the fans, like yourself, who were
disappointed by the greedy, corporate MTV/Paramount/Viacom asswipes, who are trying to make lots of money by feeding us their incomplete
and censored crap. Don\'t be like them!

Thank You Drive Thru!!

PS: Some technical advise regarding burning these DVDs: The torrent includes the DVDs. 
In order for these discs to play properly on your DVD-player, I recommend you burn these with ImgBurn (freeware) at low speed (6x) and on decent blanks (e.g. Verbatim).
I tried higher speeds and cheaper blanks and thus created tons of...uhh...beer coasters! Also, when I tried other burn software it
messed up the DVD-menu structure. So ImgBurn is the way to go!
