,Silverfish881,2010-10-15T13:12Z,"@DanielGomes & dosie6
the reason your anti-virus/internet security is flagging up a trojan/virus is all down to the way Keygens are made, 99 times out of 100 they are not actually viruses."
,lynx_ca,2010-10-22T20:04Z,"keygenerators are malicious software, or hacking tools. they will almost always flag almost any virus program. 

if they have a skull by their name you can almost always guarantee they are legitimate. 

keep in mind when downloading torrents that trackers, keygenerators, windowers, and other hacking/cracking tools will flag your virus software. and they will come up as trojan.keylogger or trojan.dropper most times. "
