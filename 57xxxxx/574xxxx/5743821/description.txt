This film is about a blackinese samurai warrior named Rukashi who is on a mission to kill the were-demons and gang members from Afghanistan, Dranko and Monka.

Originally it was shot from 2001 to 2004 and it took a while to finish this movie.

Alex could not afford film for this project. There was no MiniDV camera available till 2005. It was either film or flat video. We shot on regular Hi-8 video.

The director had some music in this movie for which he did not have permission. Since 2007 he has remastered the film with free music. It makes him unhappy because it has retro and video game music.
