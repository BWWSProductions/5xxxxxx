[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-08-08T23:06Z,"Would anybody like me to upload The IT Crowd Seasons 1-3?     
UK comedy series about two I.T. nerds and their clueless female manager, who work in the basement of a very successful company. When they are called on for help, they are never treated with any respect at all. "

The I.T. Crowd looks kinda funny, I'll give it a try but I would prefer Entourage Seasons 2-6 first"
,omegastoo,2010-08-10T16:50Z,You gonna upload IT crowd seasons 2-4? (season 4 just finished airing) If so rock on they're great. Any chance of a decent rip of Tron? whenever I try to encode it I get the aspect ratio screwed up as the only ones i could find to code from were in letterbox not 16:9 and my encoding software gets confused.
