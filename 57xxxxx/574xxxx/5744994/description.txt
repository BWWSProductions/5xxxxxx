NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Cats and Dogs 2

Right sources used was the russian cam video off relizlab and audio off TA 
Now workdone.....well the first thing was to try and get a full audio track as the ta audio was missing the intro,so 
opted to keep the first min of russian audio instead of cutting the video or leaving it blank.Also theres another 50 secs
after the russian audio which is from another source .....so it's all mixed,but it was the only way to get a full audio track 
The video was pretty good but had two main problems ...the first is the chairs covering alot of the screen in the first few mins and
then the main issue is the bloody flicker.
Not too much we can do about each so.......yes there still there 
Other than that we have tweaked the video to give it some more life and we used a white balance to correct the rgb colours and also 
used a sharpen filter.
We also straightened up the video a touch,not as much as prism due to the fact you lose alot off the right and on some scenes you can lose 
a whole dog  Not knocking prisms as they did a great job correcting the slant.But we opted to find a medium so you didn't lose too 
much.

Anyway enjoy this release and if it wasn't for that flicker it would be a pretty good release.
