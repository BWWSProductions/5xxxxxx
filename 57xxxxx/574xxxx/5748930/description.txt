The film was as controversial as the novel, though this time there was no prosecution for obscenity. Though both book and film were laced throughout with racy innuendo calling into question the issue of marital fidelity, it was the film adaptation that may have been the more alarming, inasmuch as it portrayed a popular uprising, or Marxist insurrection, in the southern United States by millworkers laid off from work and trying to gain control of the factory equipment which their jobs depend on. Philip Yordan was officially given credit for the screenplay, but it was actually by Ben Maddow. Since Maddow was blacklisted for suspected Communist activities during the 1950s Red Scare, working without credit was the only way he could successfully submit screenplays.

Set in Georgia amidst the wild and woolly Walden clan, Gods Little Acre (1958) tells the story of a farmer patriarch Ty Ty Walden (Robert Ryan) obsessed with the idea that there is gold buried by his grandfather on the family farm. The only spot untouched by Ty Tys shovel, Gods Little Acre is set aside as a tithe for the church. But that acre tends to move around, depending upon where Ty Ty wants to dig. When director Anthony Manns film opens, Ty Ty and his two sons Buck Walden (Jack Lord) and Shaw Walden (Vic Morrow) are deep within one of the pits that litter the Walden farm after 15 years of digging for their fortune. Ty Ty has allowed his land to grow fallow, much to the amazement of his black farm hand Uncle Felix (Rex Ingram) who reminds him that all the effort he is putting into his endless treasure hunt could yield greater rewards if hed farm the land.

Ty Ty is occasionally distracted in his big dig by strange notions Ã¢
