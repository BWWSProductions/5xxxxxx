The Jamaican rap group is back!!!!

With the new Mixtape "There's None Like Us, So None Like Us"

So for all who's been waiting, it's finally here.

And for all who don't know about Fo-5ifth or think Jamaican's can only do Dancehall and Reggae, better get familiar and guess again. Because this is no-doubt one of the hottest mixtapes of the year.It actually sounds more like an album.

 

!!!!! HOT !!!!!
