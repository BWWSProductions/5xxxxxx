,skygear,2010-08-06T04:47Z,"internet is down, bad weather.... will be back up in the morning i'm told"
,pc8200,2010-08-06T04:49Z,"Great, Can you tell me how to install it, step by step please.
Thanks"
,SerSpec-V,2010-08-06T05:13Z,"^^^Same as all the others PC. 0 seeders and 24kb/s, maybe tomorrow will  be better."
,skygear,2010-08-06T10:42Z,"actually i think this is a WORLD FIRST! 
and looks like a few are finishing, 
so if they seed will be quicker or if you want get the full mapsource version and make your own...."
,skygear,2010-08-06T10:53Z,hahaha now within 5 minuites there are 76+ seeders so if your d/l  isnt soaring now ... you need to check your settings
,prariebear,2010-08-06T16:21Z,"Can anyone verify the exact file name and size ? I have downloaded this file twice and it is not recognized by winzip, 7zip or magic iso.
Thanks"
,davincighost,2010-08-06T17:54Z,"requesting latest version for Brazil, thanx"
,SerSpec-V,2010-08-06T22:06Z,Downloaded very fast today :). Installed in my 255W and working fine. Thanks skygear!
,pripoi,2010-08-08T21:11Z,"Did this work for anybody else? Tried Nero, CDBurnerXP, magiciso.. No go. Skygear, what did you use to create the IMG file?
"
,SerSpec-V,2010-08-09T01:12Z,"You don't have to extract the file, you have IMG files in your garmin. Instructions have been posted for other garmin maps on P.Bay maybe you should read those. There is nothing wrong with the file and you don't need a any software."
,jsk1634,2010-08-09T19:12Z,"I looked everywhere for instructions to make this work.  i keep on getting ""no detail maps installed"".  I tried overwriting img file, also tried converting nothing works help please"
,jsk1634,2010-08-09T19:38Z,i got it... don't delete orginal file just overwrite it.
,SerSpec-V,2010-08-09T22:14Z,"You can del the original map, I always do. You can use the instructions for the 2011.10 map for this one. "
,brianxxx,2010-08-11T17:51Z,"Fully instructions that work. Haklabs is the place to go for Garmin instructions.

,SerSpec-V,2010-08-11T21:31Z,Also tested map on a nuvi 260.
,biz48,2010-08-12T16:33Z,Tested and working great on nuvi 750. Thank you.
,eigle1,2010-08-17T22:31Z,how do i install the img
,nexus2004,2010-08-18T23:09Z,"How I installed on my Garmin 350...I took a 2gb sd card and formatted it to FAT32. Next, within the sd card I created a folder called ""Garmin"". Last I dragged and dropped the downloaded img file to that folder. Its already unlocked. Thats all! Once its transfered to the Garmin unit, go into the setting and check the newly imported map and uncheck the older one."

,thedonofdeath,2010-08-26T11:16Z,Ok so got a new garmin nuvi 255 from bestbuy (they are on sale for $109 (america only)) brought it home and say it had the 2010.10. so downloaded this. deleted old gmapprom and moved this over (took about hour) started my brand new (now updated :) ) garmin up and bam it totally works. Thank you Thank you. So simple Works Flawless. 
,rchan111,2010-08-27T23:58Z,Works great with my Nuvi 660.
,BriMac1950,2010-08-28T00:22Z,I can't see how to load this. Do I just paste it into the garmin folder on the gps or do I need to delete the original folder first? The gmapsupp on the gps is a .unl file with a code in it. Sorry to ask but i can't see the instructions aywhere and haklabs is down.....has been for 2 days. 
,JimiHendrix87,2010-08-31T14:52Z,"Hi,
I am new to this and bought myself a Garmin Oregon 300. Can someone post a complete step-by-step guide on how to install this map to my device.
Thanks
jimi"
,jwillia,2010-09-03T04:18Z,"Copied and pasted""gmapsupp.img"" into ""Garmin"" folder on Nuvi after backing up and removing ""gmapprom.img"" from same folder. Works like a charm, beats the heck out of doing it the other way! Kudos to everyone who worked on this one!"
,jwillia,2010-09-03T04:19Z,"Forgot to mention, this worked for me on a Nuvi 760. Very simple, absolutely flawless!"
,wobbletop,2010-09-14T05:28Z,"On my garmin 680, this showed very poor maps for Canada. Just the major streets."
,Dyna1325,2010-09-17T01:43Z,"When I put this on my nuvi 1300, my local area maps became less detailed. My nuvi, when I turn it on says stuff about 2007. Why would the stock map be better than this one(for my local area)?"
,yuyo_79,2010-09-17T19:25Z,"Thanks for the torrent. Just a question, I tried using it for Mexico but when I look for an address no street names appear, you know how could I solve this?"
,ArcAngel66,2010-09-19T14:54Z,1Q -- how is it that you have a 2011.20 when it only shows at Garmin (in regards to mine 765T) a map update available 2010.10 and one not available 2010.20 -- just curious as i would assume Garmin would have a version 2011.20...
,Av8tor69,2010-09-26T17:20Z,Works on a Nuvi 360...Thanks! 
,tmandorfer,2010-10-06T13:04Z,"This worked great once I made a slight change on how to do this on my nuvi265wt. 
1) Simply create a folder named ""Gramin"" on a 2gb SD card (Not SDHC). Make sure this card is completely empty.
2)Transfer the the zip file from your hardrive to the SD card and place it in the ""Garmin"" folder (you dont have to unzip or unrar this file, leave it alone)
3) Rename the file on the SD card ""gmapsupp"", (for me I did not add the .img extension, tried it first and didn't work, removed it and it worked)
4) Now enjoy having to 2011 maps!"
,tmandorfer,2010-10-06T13:07Z,"5) Then just add the SD card to your garmin while its turned off.
6) Turn it on then go to tools-settings-maps-maps info, then check the 2011 maps and uncheck whatever old map you are using.
7) You must have the SD card in the GPS in order to use the maps, now enjoy"
,pasacota,2010-10-09T14:54Z,"Thanks for the upload, it worked perfect for me and I got it installed on my two Garmin GPS (Nuvi 255 and Nuvi 255WT)"
,dm30001,2010-10-29T16:35Z,"thanks for the upload, works perfect for c330. =)"
,dm30001,2010-10-29T16:38Z,"p.s.

to 'install' the file on a c330 and most devices,

you need a sd card unless you have enough  internal/default memory, then just create a folder named garmin (spelled exactly like that) then copy the file over into the garmin folder and then load the maps from the sd to your device! k thx bye."
,dm30001,2010-10-30T16:57Z,"ok i'm back to tell you that i tested this torrent out on my c330 and works great BUT some of the neighborhoods that have been there for 20+ years don't even show up and is blank (no roads)...i get all the main highways and shit though.

thanks. bye."
,leatherneck6017,2010-11-13T08:13Z,"Had to rename the file to ""gmapprom.img"" to get it to work on my 1490T.

Works great after the rename!

Nice up."
,vIce-gRip,2010-11-20T20:57Z,"Works fine... all the negative scores and comments are from complete m0r0ns.
They should not attempt to Download stuff if they have no idea what they are doing."
,MrRedLogan,2010-11-21T14:21Z,Have a Nuvi 205w and it works flawless. Took out the old map and simply pasted the new one in. But for some reason it took over an hour to get the map on the device. Im running on usb 2.0. But that has nothing to do with you. AWESOME UPLOAD
,f1200,2010-12-06T21:33Z,"dm30001, can you tell me how exactly you got this to work with the c330 please?  I would like to replace the current map that is on the c330 if that is possible seeing how this update is 1.25 gb.  If you got it to work with an SD card, I read somewhere the c330 will only take a 512mb card.  Is this true?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance."
,Punkristo,2010-12-09T21:31Z,Does this have the full map for Mexico or does it only have the main highways?
,kikindb,2011-05-03T23:50Z,"Thanks a lot for the maps, the download is very faster 605kpbs average :D"
,dai0ma,2011-06-10T03:12Z,Work perfect in nuvi 255w microsd 16gb. Thanks a lot!
