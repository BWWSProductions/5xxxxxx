There are 2 things you REALLY need as a die-hard X-Japan fan:

1. The Xtreme Discography (will be uploaded soon)

2. The X-Japan MEGAPACK (this torrent)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quality and format of the material varies, as most of the stuff comes
from the 80's and 90's when bandwith and hardiskspace were not abundant.

A lot of the stuff is very rare and nearly impossible to come by.

The Last-Live DVD's are both included.

I deseve no credit - my anonymous japanese friend deserves it - she put
most of this torrent together and uploaded the first torrent.

OBSERVE!!!!! --> IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO X-JAPAN WERE/ARE - IF YOU ARE NOT
ALREADY A DIE HARD X-FAN.....THEN DON'T WASTE TIME AND BANDWITH.

THIS STUFF IS FOR FANS O N L Y !!

Dedicated to Steph, who introduced me to X.

FOREVER X, FOREVER hide, FOREVER LOVE!
