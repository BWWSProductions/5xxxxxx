Plot:


Aided by his servants Mort and Maurice, pint-sized party animal King Julien repeatedly clashes with the penguins and other zoo animals as he invents a holiday to honor himself, steals a helmet with magical powers and misplaces his precious crown. This collection of animated episodes also finds the hilariously bossy lemur upsetting a grumpy kangaroo, becoming jealous of Mort and reluctantly handing over power to Maurice.
