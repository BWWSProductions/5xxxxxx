Katt even mentions ""It's 2004"" and Sam Tripoli's cracking Kobe Bryant jokes to put a date on things. It would have been much better to try and get this released earlier, but now it's just a cash-in attempt. The best part of this DVD was Aries Spears, he was amazing if you'd never seen him outside of Mad TV."
