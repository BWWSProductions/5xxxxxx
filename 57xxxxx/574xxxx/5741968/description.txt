The sequel to Stardock's hit turn-based strategy game, Galactic Civilizations II  is a strategy game that takes place in the distant future where mankind has become a space-faring civilization and now must contend with other galactic powers who strive for domination in the galaxy.

The sequel includes numerous changes over the original, including the ability to design entire fleets of unique ships from research technology points, more variation in planets for greater numbers of choices on any class of planet, fleet command options, improved combat, and 10 playable races of characters. Galactic Civilizations II also features a vastly overhauled and scalable graphics engine that now runs in 3D (yet is still playable on low-end systems.)
