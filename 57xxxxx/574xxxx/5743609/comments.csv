,StormtrooperZ,2010-08-07T23:44Z,"Installs perfectly without problem. When running the game it gives me the message ""... has stopped working.

If you click that away you can go back briefly into the game seeing the main menu, but then quickly goes back to desktop. Which means it's unplayable for me at the moment."
,L-Jazz,2010-08-09T12:37Z,"Installs perfectly and I can copy the crack without problem. I get to the main menu and can change the settings but when I click New game, the screen goes black and the game stops responding. I've tried on Windows 7 and Vista. Was really looking forward to playing this."

As a seasoned adventurer I can say that it is a very good adventure game, a capturing story with very good characters that get you involved in and incredible voice-acting. A must-have for all adventuregame enthusiasts!"
