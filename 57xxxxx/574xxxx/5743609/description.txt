Release Notes:

The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks.
We're a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark
under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root
of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and
nothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do
this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene
started in the mid eighties.

If you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back
on contacting us as soon as possible.

On with the game release information:

When a series of gruesome murders shake a small town after a
strange aristocrat dies and his body goes missing, rumors of a
supernatural monster abound. In life Sir William was known to
be a cruel and evil man, rumored to be the murderer behind
many unsolved crimes. Now in death, this latest spurt of crime
has the entire village shaking in fear with some even fleeing.
The local police are beside themselves and have made no
headway in solving the crimes. Detective Briscol, a man of
logic and principles and Timothy Moor, a poor immigrant turned
petty thief become unlikely partners to solve these terrible
crimes. Alternating between these roles, players will
investigate these strange events and gradually reveal a dark
secret.

Experience the gripping murder mystery from alternative
perspectives.
