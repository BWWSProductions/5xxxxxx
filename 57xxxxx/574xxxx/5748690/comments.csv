To everyone else I'll post comment after."
,bl00mes,2010-08-09T02:47Z,"thanks a lot... i need more than an hour to download 1.45 movie,.. I'll post my comment after downloading this movie"
,crossfire6,2010-08-09T02:48Z,Appreciate the decent seed speed on this.  Should knock it out in about 90 min or less.
,crossfire6,2010-08-09T03:44Z,Damn!  The speed slowed down.  Still got about an hour to go.  Still intend to report back on quality as soon as I can.
,crossfire6,2010-08-09T03:58Z,"Now I'm getting suspicious.  The download is consistently slowing down.  The number of seeders has increased (supposedly), but speed is steadily slowing.  I wonder if this is one of those fake trash torrents that just stops at 97%?  I'll let you know when I get there."
,dumbson,2010-08-09T06:45Z,"well, did any of you cunts finish downloading? lol a/v?"
,chitchatid,2010-08-09T10:00Z,"tq 4 sharing. if you could provide on the 700 megabytes, i will be very much appreciated. so are the coming and/or the running movies like the expendables, public enemy number one, female agents, the sorcerer's apprentice. tq"
,n3llo,2010-08-09T10:14Z,"going by the fact that raymondhome has uploaded this and the screen shots, this looks to be the best copy on TPB yet!!

,djs187,2010-08-09T10:16Z,very watchable. lot of camera movement though.    v-7 a-8
,crossfire6,2010-08-10T00:08Z,"Sorry, ender-.  I did not realize that a skull guaranteed reliability.  I suppose I should have since I can recall getting nothing but good stuff from skulls.  Anyway, I have to say that this is a pretty good copy from what I can see in the sample.  I have a good feeling about it as I burn it, and I offer 1,000 apologies to you, raymondhome, for being skeptical.  My apologies to the others also for my negative comments.  Thanks to all for the great work that you do."
,crossfire6,2010-08-11T00:55Z,"Agree with djs187.  Very watchable.  Good video and better audio than most cams, much better."
,corezz,2010-08-11T03:54Z,Shame this release is missing about 20 mins...i guess i will hold off since i can watch a complete version from the previous release.
,freespirit_10,2010-08-21T06:05Z,"Thank you Raymondhome. As usual your movie is one of the better ones on this site, I appreciate all the effort you put into keeping the best quality movies available to us."
,saltriver,2010-08-25T01:19Z,thanks i appreciate it.Shipwreck
,zyxwvut,2010-09-05T01:04Z,"If you don't mind a shakey movie with poor audio quality then by all means download this... I would have certainly not marked this as ""VIP"", but to each his own. Thank you for the upload, but I am disatisfied."
,lissandroZS,2010-09-09T05:59Z,"Jesus...
of course this is not watchable...shakey...horrible...
