IMAGiNE NOTES
Source used was ORCs homemade video + audio ... Thanks guys :)
Now the source was nice but suffered from two major things ... camera movement and flicker.
Now the flicker only happens a few times and not for long ... the bad news is the cammer had ants in his pants :P
Got to give orc credit for having the balls to go and do it, so fair play lads.
Right all weve done for this is done a small script to resize, white balance, rgbeq, contrast, brightness and sharpen.
Nothing has been done to the angles or camera movement ... just too bad to do anything decent to it.

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
