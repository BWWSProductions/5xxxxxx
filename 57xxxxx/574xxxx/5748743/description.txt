[umunu] Mirror of www.yamaguchy.netfirms.com.ZIP

A great little website, http://www.yamaguchy.netfirms.com  , seems down for good. The anonymous creator/s had compiled a library of works primarily devoted to the money question, with hard to find books and essays by Arthur Kitson, Christopher Hollis, June Grem, Robert McNair Wilson, A.N. Field, Charles Lindbergh (Sr.), Ezra Pound among many others.

It seems a great shame that this resource might be lost, so I am thankful that I downloaded the entire site to my hard drive some time ago. I have uploaded a zip file of the entire site toso that others may download it. Zipped the package is 50MB, unzipped about 95MB but better viewing. Navigate from the index page.
