About this game:
How smart are you? Do you know more than your Grandma about world history? Does your little sister know more than your Dad about sports? Find out in Smarty Pants! Smarty Pants finally levels the playing field for people of all ages, allowing simultaneous play using age-targeted trivia plus action-based gestures, making it a truly trans-generational game made exclusively for the Wii. Tailoring questions to the contestant's age, gamers from eight to eighty can join in on the fun all at the same time. Exciting Wii gestures make everything a game, from spinning the category wheel and tug-of-wars over correct answers, to "dance-offs" for additional points. With both competitive and collaborative game modes and 20,000 questions in multiple categories, the fun is virtually endless!
