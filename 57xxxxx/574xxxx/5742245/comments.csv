Mostly in synch, but some obvious places where it isn't. Quality doesn't live up to the large size. You may as well download a smaller one."

It also stays in synch when burned to a DVD. I recommend the smaller Diverse rip as long as you aren't using your TV's media player. It's better quality than this bloated rip."
