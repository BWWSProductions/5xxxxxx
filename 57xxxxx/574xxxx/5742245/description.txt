        Ray (Chris O'Dowd - "The IT Crowd") is obsessed with time 
        travel and all things sci-fi, Toby (Marc Wooton - "Confetti") 
        is a film nerd with ambition but absolutely no talent and 
        their mate Pete (Dean Lennox Kelly - "Shameless") is a 
        sarcastic cynic who prefers darts to Darth Vader.
        
        When Ryan is approached by Cassie, (Anna Faris - "Scary Movie"
        , "Lost In Translation") a beautiful girl who claims to be 
        from the future, and Pete stumbles through a rip in the time 
        space continuum in the gents, the three bunglers quickly 
        realise there's going to be more to their evening than peanuts 
        and the pub quiz.
        
        This self-referential Brit-flick draws as much on your grey 
        matter as it does your stomach muscles, and asks, if not 
        completely answering, all of the questions you ever had about 
        time travel but never had the time to ask.
