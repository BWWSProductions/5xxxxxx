He befriends the Goldi (Nanai) hunter Dersu Uzala and invites him to guide the explorers through the stark forest up to Khanka Lake.

But the old man does not adapt to the urban lifestyle and decides to return to the forest. In 1910, Captain Arseniev is called to KorfovskaÃ¯a to identify the body of a man that has his calling card and might be Dersu Uzala.
