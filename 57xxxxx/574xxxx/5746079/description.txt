Comments
The band play as a four piece following the sacking of the bass playing during the sound check before Pete Trewavas joined.
Sound is a touch tiny, but then there's no bass, but other than that a very good recording especially when you consider when it was done.

CD artwork is include and files are tagged with front cover.

Line Up:
Fish - Vocals
Steve Rothery - Guitar
[no one] - Bass
