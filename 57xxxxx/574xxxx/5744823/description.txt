Tattoos & Tequila is the third solo studio album by MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e frontman Vince Neil. It is Neil's first solo release in 7 years since the live album Live at the Whisky: One Night Only in 2003 and the first solo studio album in 15 years since 1995's Carved in Stone.

The album is largely made up of covers of 1970s rock songs, with only a couple of original tracks thrown in: the title track "Tattoos & Tequila" (written by Marti Frederiksen) which was released as the first single, and "Another Bad Day" (written by Nikki Sixx, James Michael and Tracii Guns). Neil has stated: "This album has nothing to do with Motley Crue, Tattoos and Tequila is basically my life".

The album was recorded with Slaughter members Jeff Blando (guitar) and Dana Strum (bass), and drummer Zoltan Chaney.
