I recently acquired a video capture card and Pinnacle studio program, and am learning how to use them. If anyone can offer some advice or links to some good tutorials, they would be happily accepted. Still, this is not a bad rip from VHS. For my regular uploaders, please stay tuned for some rare or unique TV offerings from my ancient VHS collection.

This was aired on PBS in 2008. It is a rebroadcast of a 1978 concert aired on THE OLD GREY WHISTLE TEST, a music program that aired on the BBC from 1971 to 1987. PBS used it as one of their fundraising shows, so I had to cut out the parts begging for money.
