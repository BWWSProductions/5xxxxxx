,ppereira1,2010-09-15T00:51Z,"why does it have 18H when i can only play until 1h:59min? (something like that)

i'm just asking, i know the film isn't 18h"
,Anmaddox,2011-07-06T00:00Z,"It probably says 18 hours because the extra content is also on the file, but is just not accessible. That's why it only plays for an hour and eighteen minutes."
