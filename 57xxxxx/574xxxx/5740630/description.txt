Alter Ego Progressive returns for release number 25 with Russian newcomer Sergey Prosvirin under his Groove Mafia guise and he serves us the very groovey summer anthem Alone In Love. Remixes come from fellow Progressive stable mates Pamuya & Vito De Santis.

The Original is very much the sound of now, summer themed sounds right down to the bone with a fantastic melody to top it off! A feel good tune with a fantastic piano break down that will definitely sneak its way into many DJ sets this summer. Dont miss this beauty!

Pamuya serves his nice and cold as usual for the summer months, delicious sounds and grooves make this mix steam on effortlessly. This one has a bit more bite than the original and will work just as good! Top work once again by the Sweede.

New Alter Ego artist Vito De Santis rounds up the release in fine style with his beach themed mix!
