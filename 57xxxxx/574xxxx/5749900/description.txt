This may be the only time in this series' short 
history in which the main guest star gets a credit 
in the opening theme. What's more....he received top 
billing over most of the regular cast.

Richard Boone gave one of his most interesting performances
post-Have Gun Will Travel.

Meanwhile, Robert Duvall didn't have enough to do!

Also in the guest cast are Andrew Duggan and Ed Flanders.
