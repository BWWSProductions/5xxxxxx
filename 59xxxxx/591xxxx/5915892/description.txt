Here we have a DVD rip of Animals, Whores & Dialogue - Breakfast with Hunter Vol.2, for good or ill. I cannot take credit for this. If you want to thank someone thank gummo79. Gummo79 is the one who originally uploaded the entire DVD here:

I just downloaded it and converted it into one .avi file. I used iSkySoft iMedia Converter to convert from VIDEO_TS to .avi. This is for all of us HST fans that need to save every last kB of harddrive space.

I don't have the fastest upload speed in the world so please have patience. I will seed for as long as it takes. Thank you gummo79 for originally uploading. Please enjoy this wonderful HST documentary and PLEASE SEED when you're finished downloading. Thank you. Res ipsa loquitur.
