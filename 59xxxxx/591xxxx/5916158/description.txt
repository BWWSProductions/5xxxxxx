"Halloween"

Claire loves Halloween and is gearing up to 
spookify the Dunphy house for the trick or 
treaters. She gives each family member a role 
to play, but none of it goes quite right... 
Cameron can't shake a traumatic childhood 
experience and hates the holiday, Mitchell 
has had a terrible day at work, and Gloria is 
acting weird after Jay and Manny teased her 
about her accent.


Enjoy more family with real settings and a
non-garbage source :)
