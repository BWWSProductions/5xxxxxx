,vinci89,2010-10-26T14:51Z,"@mercury...

I am now in second season of twin peaks, 6 episodes far.... I am a person who likes lost, house, the wire, damages and mad men. 

Twin peaks is simply overrated, probably in the 90's it was like 'lost' bt, quite honestly anyone who hasn't watched it then bt seeing it now, ll see that its ""dated""...and on top of that feels quite half baked....fbi, murder, teen drama and superantural..all quite in low standards to today's shows and even to david lynchs other quality muvies."
,xNJx,2010-10-26T15:53Z,"@ RiddlerA - Dude try uploading this classic if you want/can!

Thanks mate!!"
,DSIN,2010-10-26T17:34Z,"@riddlera : thanx dude... 
will watch this one for sure after DEXTER...

@vinci : how overrated can twin peaks be ? 
its rated 9.4 (imdb)... & + its only 29 episodes...
i for one will surely giv it a go... 

p.s : iam a person who Loves DEXTER & Friends, likes Lost, Prison break, supernatural, numb3rs, inbetweeners & hates some idiotic shows( *coughs*gossipgirl,o.c*coughs*)  ;)"

,KingFisheR222,2010-10-26T19:33Z,"""Friends"", SS1-10 please.
There's alot on the PB, I know, but unless it's not the official DVDs- those are huge and hard to seed all in all, there's no any good converted (size-quality-dimwnsion)
25-350 mib per an episode would be superperfect quality. I'd seed it  for a year, I promise. Please... Please-pllease.
I know it's not that easy, but I beseash you, man! I'l pray. Thanks. "

,nitrogun,2010-10-27T12:39Z,"Getting desperate for a seeder please, Peers visible now down to 12, 6 on 90% and 6 from 7% to 83%, all the rest that were visible on 90% have given up and left, soon I will be the only one at 90% uploading to those hopeful 6 with even less than me. Difficult to be forced to abandon a good download at 90%, especially when it was only uploaded one day ago. "
