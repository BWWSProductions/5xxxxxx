Dhaniram brings a trucker named Gerulal to Jugni's house so that he can rent a room. Jugni lives in dilapidated house with three young daughters, all of whom are of marriage age. The eldest is Mimki, followed by Mithu, and Chinki. Her husband is an alcoholic and wayward, and comes home every few weeks. Jugni past was sordid and involved dancing in a brothel. Jugni and her daughters labor for a living. Gerulal gets settled in, and becomes part of this family. Then when he gets news of his maternal grandmother's passing, he leaves and does not return for several months. When he returns, nothing and no one is the same anymore.


In short, Namkeen is truly namkeen in taste it has various tastes sourness of emotions, sweetness of light comedy, little bit bitterness of complicated relations, and in addition it is close to nature and reality like Desi butter milk with masala added. So if you have not seen it yet, just download dvd and enjoy one of the best Gulzar+ Sanjeev Kumar+ R D Burman combination with added benefits of Waheeda Rehman, Sharmila Tagore, Shabana Aazmi and Kiran Vairale.
