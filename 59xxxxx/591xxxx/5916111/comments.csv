,supz,2011-03-30T20:15Z,"@FallenIdles

You got found out because you have no idea what you're doing."

,BramLovesYou,2011-08-21T06:19Z,"Wow, I'm impressed. I downloaded this and another 720p torrent of this movie, except I figured this one would be of less quality since it's only a 2GB mp4, and the other was a 6GB mkv. 

But nope, I put them side by side on my 32inch TV, and there's zero difference. You've got to tell me how you did it, to trim off 4GB and lose no quality. I'm amazed.

Kudos."
