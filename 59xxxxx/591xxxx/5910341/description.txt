Dougray Scott and Joely Richardson star in this star-studded two-part BBC remake of the classic science fiction thriller. In the near future, humankind's search for an alternative fuel supply leads to the discovery of the ominous Triffid, a crop cultivated for its fuel that seems to have a life of its own. But when spectators gather worldwide for a much-anticipated solar storm, billions are left blinded and the few sighted survivors watch as society collapses into chaos. The Triffids, meanwhile, find their way out of captivity. Free to roam the planet with a fatal sting, and a retributive taste for human flesh, the Triffids begin rapid breeding. It is up to Dr Bill Masen (Scott) to lead the brave in their epic battle against the Triffids' reign of terror in what could be the last days for humankind. Vanessa Redgrave, Brian Cox, Jason Priestley and Eddie Izzard co-star.
