This is, or was, available on CD.  I occasionally search for a good CD-rip and stumbled onto this website: www.musicstack.com  Lots of this available in various formats.

No idea how good the CD is compared to vinyl.  I was in the process of cleaning up my recording of vinyl to seed torrent in FLAC.  I'll continue searching for a good CD rip.  If I don't find one, I'll seed the entire album I have."
