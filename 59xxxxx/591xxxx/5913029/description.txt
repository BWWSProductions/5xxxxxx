       The American Scream The actor concludes his study by focusing on the 
       American movies produced in the late 1960s and 1970s, including Night 
       of the Living Dead and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. He explores how they 
       were often made by pioneering independent film-makers and reflected social 
       upheaval, and gets the inside story from well-known directors of the genre 
       George A Romero, Tobe Hooper and John Carpenter.
