,MMIFreak,2010-11-03T16:07Z,"First of all,
the quality was decent, but the Audio was not in sync.. not to mention it was rather annoying that it would randomly skip for 30 seconds in random parts of the movie.
Other than that, great download,
Second of all,
This movie was stupid.
but, Napolean Dynomite stupid, to the point where it was hilarious cuz my fiance and I kept wondering, wtf is going on? haha"

,kbohunt,2010-11-06T07:41Z,"@kareru

I can understand if you didn't enjoy the movie, but don't be so biased. The movie has a very high approval rating, just look at the imdb reviews for it. This movie wasn't really intended to be one of those Superbad/crude humor flicks, this is suppose to be a fun movie, imo take it as such and don't troll over it."
,freem513,2010-11-06T09:39Z,"This film was intended for nerds. Plain and simple. Don't bash because you can't relate. In my opinion this has to be the greatest movie I've ever seen, if not that, then at least in the top 5."
,Lucky13s,2010-11-06T09:54Z,"What the fuck?

Not a bad movie, but I had no fucking clue what was going on this whole movie.

I should probably rewatch this when I'm high or something because, its just so... random.

Still good upload though."

,bulwark07,2010-11-21T17:12Z,"Although this version has the most seeds, another one about 2.9 to 3 GB in size worked better for me.  The audio in this one was not quite in sync.  maybe out by a quarter second.  Very slight, but enough to be annoying.  Video good though, although a bit strange movie!  lol

I'll give it V:9 A:7 cause of sync issues.  But maybe not everyone experienced it that way."
,Indiron,2010-11-22T01:20Z,this movie aint for everyone. get over it fucktards.

,SodaGod,2010-11-24T08:17Z,"Before you watch this movie you have to understand that it takes place in its own universe, with its own rules. People getting into video game style fights and dropping coins when they die is the norm in the Scott Pilgrim universe, so really if you're a grandpa or don't understand video games or comics you probably won't understand this or enjoy it."
,kknd1986,2010-11-25T08:06Z,"This is an amazing movie, I saw it at the cinema and will be buying the DVD as soon as it comes out.

As others have said if your not the right age with the right background (sega/N64 etc) with an appreciation of 'the old days' of gaming then you probably won't enjoy this.

Calling it a crap movie however.... well thats basically red flagging yourself as being semi-retarded.
Also calling it a kids movie is a joke (I saw reviewers do this) no kid under the age of 18 is likely to even understand the context, let alone appreciate it."

,bailey_bat,2010-12-12T22:25Z,"""Micheal Cera REALLY? Why, wasn't Jay Baruchel, Shia LaBeouf, Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen, Jack Black or Justin Long available? It seems like Hollywood producers ONLY go to LOSERS when casting movies. ""

,zorak1,2010-12-14T21:22Z,"Thanks, movie was kinda lame but thank you anyways."
,imahaxyoo,2010-12-15T08:33Z,"@zakimar
I honestly really liked this movie with him as the main actor. Admittedly I think its a bit funny that hes like 20 or something and his voice is high pitched but apart from that this movie is honestly in my top 3 movies which is pretty good IMO. And Seth Rogen? Are you serious? I think the producer made a pretty swell decision for the actors.

For everyone who wants to know how good the movie is, I would honestly say it is worth downloading ATLEAST. This movie doesn't deserve half the negative comments its getting. Loved it and I've watched it 10 times over, probably more. 8/10 for me tbh."

So, trolls, look up info on the movies you want to torrent, before going on to say it sucks. It just makes you look bad."
