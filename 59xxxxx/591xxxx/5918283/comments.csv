,Pro21,2011-05-02T20:28Z,"Great quality, great UL, thanks for the torrent!!"
,vivatpb5776,2011-05-21T11:55Z,"Very good quality. Some slight pixelation throughout the series but not enough to ruin the show. For those that care, Season one is censored but the other seasons are uncensored. Also, only Season 6 is wide screen (576*336). The other five seasons are full screen (576*432). I am going to check to see if I can find wide screen versions of the other seasons. Thank you uploader."

,Dwch,2012-03-15T23:21Z,"@vivatpb5776: Seasons 1-5 were shot in 4:3, so I'm afraid you'll never see them in widescreen. They must have started shooting in HD for season 6, which explains why it's the only season with widescreen dimensions. Long story short: widescreen versions of seasons 1-5 never existed. These rips are as good as it gets.

Thanks MeesterDaveed for uploading this amazing TV torrent with an actual description! I exclusively download DVDRips when it comes to TV shows, so it's nice to know that I'm getting what I want without having to download it first... 
Also wanted to say how much I appreciate you specifying the release groups (FoV, SAPHiRE, TOPAZ, SAiNTS, FFNDVD)... I know to most people it just looks like messy jibberish tacked on to the file names, but to many collectors it is VITAL INFORMATION. It not only helps identify which rips you have, but it pays respect to those that make it possible to watch this stuff for free!"
