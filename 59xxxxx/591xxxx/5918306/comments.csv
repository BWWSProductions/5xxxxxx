[V],twentyforty,2010-10-30T16:52Z,"Thank you. Just to mention, and that is the most serious reason why I hate encoding UK shows - all Poirot episodes (and other UK TV shows) have record-braking number of Hit&Runs - probably because majority of downloaders are selfish, self-indulgent, crazy, mad bastards, who doesn't care for others.


Well, you all have other places to go - and burn 2.21 GIGA on one episode of Poirot."
