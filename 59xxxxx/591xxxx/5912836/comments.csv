[V],twentyforty,2010-10-27T11:44Z,"@cindal: I can encode BluRay - but he is 100 minutes. I always cut out ""crew"" credits, meaning - I CAN make it 98 m long. LOL. 2-disc 25 anniversary DVD exist too, but I don't have it.

@hazel13: FNL never entered schedule, but so far, I managed to upload almost all episodes. That's how gonna be if new season starts.
