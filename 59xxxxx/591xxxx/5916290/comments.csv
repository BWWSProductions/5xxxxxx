,OhMyGuts,2010-10-28T07:27Z,"People will upload fakes for a number of reasons which could be...

- They want to trap and track you
- The file is infected with a virus or other nasties
- The torrent is asking you for a password that doesnt exist, to find the bogus password they want you to visit a spam advertising site.
- The torrent is asking you for a password and, in order to get it, they want your credit card details and/or for you to ring a premium rate number.
- They want to waste your time and frustrate you with the hope that, eventually, you will give up on the idea of file sharing.
- They are just being idiots etc. etc.

If you come across a torrent that you believe to be fake, then you can alert 1-800-torrent"
