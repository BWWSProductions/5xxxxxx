                    :( Bastards ruined my day."

,nosuchagent,2010-11-04T05:32Z,"yes it is a bummer that this show was canceled. some sources online seem to say that the remaining episodes will air as scheduled on the ""space"" channel in Canada. maybe some Canadians could help the rest of us out by uploading these episodes as they air up there. please?"
