,reipan,2010-11-06T20:30Z,Beware of this and the 1080p release from cinefile. especially if you save it to your main drive. i was unable to rename it. i was also not able to move or delete it. no virus or malware were detected. I had to empty the drive it was on and then format the drive with this and the 1080p version to be rid if it. wait for a differant release.

[T],Robston,2010-11-11T16:05Z,"reipan... is talking out of his/her arse. I had no issues. He/she has probably just got some bad sectors on a dodgy drive.

Download and enjoy."
