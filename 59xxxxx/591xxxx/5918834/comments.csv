[T],Coolguy33,2010-10-29T12:16Z,The File itself is roughly 9Gig so the extraction will take a while depending on your PC specs. Tested on my PC it took about 13min tops so be patient and let it extract.
[T],Coolguy33,2010-10-30T01:26Z,"Please note: The extraction will output all the necessary files to the directory of your choosing. Most common directory is C: Program Files. 
This is not an ISO or image file, it is simply the files from a full install compressed using winrar.
Once extracted run the SWTFU2 .exe in the folder to play the game."

,Spanktastic2120,2010-10-31T02:53Z,Please seed. This torrent desperately needs seeders. 
[T],Coolguy33,2010-10-31T03:15Z,"@Spanktastic2120, Leechers are @ 93% right now. They will become seeders @ 100 % !"
,treyjedi,2010-10-31T09:46Z,So does this work with cutscenes in english or what?
[T],Coolguy33,2010-10-31T11:28Z,"@treyjedi, this is the full game in english and yes it works. Nothing has been touched, it is all the files from the full install. 
I have tested this on 3 separate PC's using XP SP3, VISTA and WIN 7 and it works great.
Just make sure your PC is up to date with the latest drivers etc, as there has been known issues with the game itself.

,papitow,2010-11-01T23:22Z,Many thanks mate. It saves us big time and pain not having to install and crack and so uninstall.
,Spanktastic2120,2010-11-02T05:37Z,"i made it to the end and chose the dark side, at which point the screen went black and only the audio for the cutscene played. had to go to youtube to see the ending. everything else worked fine though. "
[T],Coolguy33,2010-11-03T05:34Z,"@FeniXrisen, you must disable Vertical Sync (Vsync) in either your Nvidia Control Panel or ATI Catalyst Control Center. It is a known bug in the game that when Vsync is enabled it causes stuttering in the cut scenes."
