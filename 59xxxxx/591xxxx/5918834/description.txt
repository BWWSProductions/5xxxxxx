After eliminating his stormtrooper captors, Starkiller embarks on a quest to understand his identity and to find his love interest from the first game, Juno Eclipse. Meanwhile, Darth Vader has hired Boba Fett to track down Juno Eclipse to lure Starkiller out of hiding. Starkiller rescues Jedi Master Rahm Kota from a gladiator arena, and encounters Yoda on Dagobah.
