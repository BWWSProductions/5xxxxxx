This is NOT the DVD from Lost: The Complete Sixth Season set. Instead, this is a smaller bonus disc, that was available for a limited time after release, exclusive to certain retailers. It contains the following bonus features for the Final Season of LOST, which are not included in the regular set:

Chicken Heaven - A behind the scenes look at the Mr. Clucks shoot from "Everybody Loves Hugo". (3:02) 
Sayid Vs. Dogen - A behind the scenes look at the Dogen and Sayid scenes from "Sundown". (2:51) 
Lost Live: The Final Concert (6:32) 
Lost on Location: "Sundown" (4:33) 
Lost on Location: "Dr. Linus" (5:13)

There are non-removable Spanish subtitles encoded into the picture. No English subtitles are available, the audio is English only. This may not look like much, but this is the only way these particular BTS short videos are available. More can be found on the DVD 5 of the regular set, which is coming soon.

PLEASE REMEMBER TO SEED THE TORRENT AFTER YOU DOWNLOAD IT.
