Plot summary

A priest becomes a vampireâ€¦another manÃ¢Â€â„¢s wife is covetedâ€¦a deadly seduction
triggers murder. Thirst is the new film from director Park Chan-wook (Old Boy,
Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance). Already a boxoffice
smash in Korea, Thirst was honored with the Prix du Jury [Jury Prize] at the
2009 Cannes International Film Festival.

Continuing his explorations of human existence in extreme circumstances, the
director spins a tale that he conceived and then developed over several years
with co-screenwriter Chung Seo-kyung.

Sang-hyun (played by top Korean star Song Kang-ho, of The Host) is a priest who
cherishes life; so much so, that he selflessly volunteers for a secret vaccine
development project meant to eradicate a deadly virus. But the virus takes the
priest, and a blood transfusion is urgently ordered up for him. The blood he
receives is infected, so Sang-hyun lives â€“ but now exists as a vampire. Struggling
with his newfound carnal desire for blood, Sang-hyunÃ¢Â€â„¢s faith is further strained
when a childhood friendÃ¢Â€â„¢s wife, Tae-ju (Kim Ok-vin), comes to him asking for his
help in escaping her life. Sang-hyun soon plunges into a world of sensual pleasures,
finding himself on intimate terms with the Seven Deadly Sins.
