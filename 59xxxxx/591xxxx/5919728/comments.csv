[V],froggie100,2010-10-30T01:06Z,rc is beta.... this is real thnxs for the up!
,rupankur,2010-10-30T15:56Z,"Hallo Thethingy & Froggie
All update of Win7 is around 300mb (roughly calculate-its depend on hardwere also) than what is contain in 2.38 GiB  in this torrent ? I donot say it is fake , asking You , because- Thethingy comment to krautschneider ."
[V],thethingy,2010-10-30T19:28Z,"rupankur, it is a full install of win 7, updates may be 300mb but in a sp the updates replace files already there so its only slightly larger than the original Win 7 that's 2.36gb, this is beta to test, I dont think it has the usb3 enabled so the finished sp1 that's out next year may be slightly larger. Thing with this is should you install it you will most likely have to reinstall windows when the final version is released as this is an integrated install whereas if you install the sp1 beta directly to your existing Win 7 then you can uninstall the beat sp to install the final one.

,805566,2010-11-01T21:59Z,"Heads up! As this is a pre-release service pack integrated into the installation image, this copy of Windows is effectively timebombed (as one can tell from running 'winver' from the installed system).

Desktop will always show ""Evaluation copy. Build 7601"" even if activated. Winver reports Service Pack 1 v.721 with an expiration date of 31 August 2011.

Runs without a hitch, thank you uploader. Reinstalling by next year is a non-issue -- just grab an SP1(final)-integrated image by then and back up your shite if need be! 10/10"
,LH-TAIMI,2010-11-13T21:59Z,u cant either update this as much as usual windows 7 with non sp1
,traxstar7,2011-01-17T17:21Z,"Does the SP1 has expiring date too ??
