Thanks Nitro for giving two big release to community :)"
,NitrogenUA,2010-10-28T11:47Z,"To guys who could not launch the game - check carefuly what 'UMD ISO MODE' and 'CPU CLOCK GAME' you are using. At fist i was also thinking it wasn't so important, but then game proved me wrong. Try setting 'UMD ISO MODE' to 'M33 driver', and 'CPU CLOCK GAME' to 'Default' as shown on this screenshot:

At least that worked for me and dozens other people. Good luck.

JIHUIN, Sure, why not.

You're welcome, everybody. Have fun =)"

,NitrogenUA,2010-10-31T14:06Z,"Most likely - yes, but no one can guarantee. You should try. Just be sure to have proper 'UMD ISO MODE' and 'CPU CLOCK GAME' settings. Good luck with this."

NitrogenUA are playable on my psp.

PLS HELP"
,NitrogenUA,2010-11-02T08:51Z,"Ok, mate. Let's see. D'you know what is VSH Menu or Recovery Menu? If yes, then go to whichever of those and set 'UMD ISO MODE' to 'M33 driver' and 'CPU CLOCK GAME' to 'Default'. The screenshot of VSH Menu can be found in torrent description. Good luck."
,rohit2707,2010-11-03T11:02Z,"yeah,i know that.i even tried that but still it shows the same problem."
,NitrogenUA,2010-11-05T11:12Z,"I dunno, man. I can only assume disabling all plugins that you may have. That's it."
,aimansaur,2010-11-06T23:31Z,hey NitrogenUA when are you going to uploud the Naruto Shippuden_ Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 english version ??
,NitrogenUA,2010-11-08T00:27Z,"Kinda strange question since i havent released a thing for an Xbox360\PS3 as of yet. And secondly since that: http://thepiratebay.org/search/Ultimate%20Ninja%20Storm%202/0/99/404 - generaly i see no sence releasing something that is already available. It is a waste of bandwidth i think. If only everything released before has flaws/not working at all. Thirdly, i dont own any of named consoles, so it's kinda shame to keep something on your harddrive that you can't realy use, if not to mention couple of PS2 games i've uploaded recently. No offence.

P.S.: Since PS3 version for Jailbreak users is not uploaded yet i can upload it, to back the sharing community. Peace."

,NitrogenUA,2010-11-09T20:50Z,"qzpogi16, sry mate, i haven't played that far. What firmware do you use, btw?

sssSlay, if you dl'ed game from here, you must have .rar file, which you should extract so you get an .iso. I think you've just gone to far - extracted iso-file too.

jin_sexy, you're welcome."
