,loufred,2010-11-25T11:06Z,Thanks for the new upload. I downloaded the ones before and half way through realised I had missed a massive bit of the story as they kept talking about what had happened but I carried on listening as was such a good story but then the end was missing. This is a fantastic audio book and should be downloaded. I will be downloading and listening to it again.

At first I had the too-short-to-not-be-kinda-annoying, incomplete version (I'm not trying to blame you; a little mistake can happen :P), so now I am really relieved I can listen to the full story after all! Good thing you fixed it! Thanks! It's a real fast upload too! I'll seed for you! Keep it up! :)"
