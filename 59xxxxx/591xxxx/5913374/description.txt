 In Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, the world was introduced to Darth Vader's
 now fugitive apprentice, Starkiller - the unlikely hero who would ignite the
 flames of rebellion in a galaxy so desperately in need of a champion. In the
 sequel, Starkiller returns with over-the-top Force powers and embarks on a
 journey to discover his own identity and to reunite with his one true love,
 Juno Eclipse. In Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, Starkiller is once again
 the pawn of Darth Vader - but instead of training his protÃ©gÃ©e as a ruthless
 assassin, the dark lord is attempting to clone his former apprentice in an
 attempt to create the Ultimate Sith warrior. The chase is on - Starkiller is
 in pursuit of Juno and Darth Vader is hunting for Starkiller. With all-new
 devastating Force powers and the ability to dual-wield lightsabers,
 Starkiller cuts a swath through deadly new enemies across exciting worlds
 from the Star Wars films - all in his desperate search for answers to his
 past.
