it will be b/w 680-730mb..."
[V],prashant22,2010-10-29T11:56Z,"@mzk
movie = gr8 too.."
[V],prashant22,2010-10-29T12:33Z,"yes it possible to make 720p from a dvd source...
example: my Dabang upload...

i hv used video convertors bt to compress movie u need to use megui or handbrake or ripboot or any other...video convertors do nt produce good quality..."
,angevil,2010-10-29T15:07Z,Will do prashant :) :) 
[V],prashant22,2010-11-01T16:01Z,"@mzk
i already told u, u hv missed many of my best..a team,iron man2...n many more...
rocky is good considering its year of release..."
,teabag87,2010-11-01T16:16Z,"you cannot make a 720p rip out of a dvd.  dvd has 480p max.  If you ""upconvert"" it, you will just add artificial pixels in the voids, which isnt true 720p.  

also, 850mb seems alittle low for a bluray rip.  the Bit Rate must take a huge hit, anything under 3000kbps does deserve to be called HD"
[V],prashant22,2010-11-01T17:15Z,"@teabag87
right a 720p from a dvd is nt a true HD thats why i havent placed it(Dabang) in the higher movies category...bt thing is my rip will look better than any 480p of 700mb...

look i dont know if u hv read a book or something abt the bit rate being 3000kbps a must for 720p...its not so actually...
and also i dont say my rips r meant for 50' screen or something...
these rips will be best viewed on a 25-26' screen or may be on 32' bt not more than that....
my aim here is to provide small quality rips for bandwidth limited people..."
,murrambingi,2010-12-18T01:28Z,"thx for the upload prashant22,

good quality, great movie

V = 8.5
A = 9"
,ztchings,2010-12-29T23:42Z,"what the hell man!? This ain't: a:10 v:10. This ain't even v:8. Audio is kinda fine but video is streched, there is lots of cubes and sometimes there is archieve errors.. If you watch it closely, you can see rough parts.. Sorry, but if you release something named 720p, be sure the release is 720p"
,SAMO88,2011-02-01T04:00Z,"Outstanding quality for 850mb

A: 8
V: 8"
,rakiem,2011-02-04T12:51Z,"A=10+

,nokiddin,2012-01-03T16:43Z,"@ DJ-Tweex
How the hell can you compare an 853 mb rip with a 2.66gb one? you're either a super-noob or a super-snob"
,Kevmeister321,2012-01-16T15:22Z,Impressive getting a 720p into 850MB!
