"Seven Names"  

In the midst of a financial crisis, Adam (Peter

will alter the company 's future. Jasmine (Joy

future plans to Jabbar (Tyree Brown), who 
reacts surprisingly to the news. Meanwhile,

argue over Amber's incessant partying with her 
new found friend. Sarah experiences challenges 
at work and even deeper issues with Gordon 
(guest star William Baldwin). Elsewhere, 
Camille (Bonnie Bedelia) joins Haddie (Sarah 
Ramos) for community service.

Enjoy :)
