Performance on a Radeon HD 3200 is terrible as well. This game syncs every frame, which makes it basically slo-mo since it's not rendering a lot of frames to start with."

ftp://ftp.lucasarts.com/patches/pc/SWTFU2_PC_EFIGS_1.1_Update.exe from http://www.lucasarts.com/support/update/SWTFU2_1_1.html

Worked for me. Took a long time to figure that out. :O"
