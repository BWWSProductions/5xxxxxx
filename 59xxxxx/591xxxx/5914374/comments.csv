Thanks for the encode/upload.

@ ALL - Please login and click the [+] symbol beside QUALITY at top of page for ALL torrents from 20-40. 
It makes a difference; shows you care and that his work is appreciated for the genius that it is!

Cheers
Jon"

[V],twentyforty,2010-10-27T11:15Z,"@hkoraddi: I couldn't resist. Thanks.

@skillet92: You already have to download few Gigabytes of your requests. I know... it's hard to resist - but try to be reasonable - you cannot download all requests you've placed and you cannot seed few Giga back. Step on the breaks - a little.

@sinner77: From end of August nothing new or good hasn't appeared. When and if ... I'll encode one, be sure."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-27T11:20Z,"Thanks Jon.

@ALL: Today ONE TV pack, with SoA, Glee, Good Wife, No ordin. fam., Parenthood, Caprica and SGU would be upped around 17:00 CET. See you then."
,skillet92,2010-10-27T11:55Z,"thats true bro.! :D
i will request it sometime later too!!
and yes i have completed mostly everythin now!
jus have abt 600-700mb left!
but gotta seed a lot!

Thanks anyways!"
,skillet92,2010-10-27T12:14Z,"@20-40:
Pls seed the Modern Family S02E01 torrent!
i am stuck 88%!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-27T12:50Z,"@skillet92: I have and I have seen 5 seeders, why you can't connect to them?
Now I cannot seed a shit - I am in middle of upload today's TV pack. But - I would seed MF 201 after aforementioned upping - but stop ALL other torrents in order to get episode faster."
,skillet92,2010-10-27T13:50Z,"it shows 5 seeders but all have lowered the upload speed to like .5kb/sec....which is sad!
and however the download got completed after 8h 18m @ 2kb/sec average!
i will be seeding the modern family episodes till tonight i guess!"
,skillet92,2010-10-27T13:50Z,Thanks a lot! :)
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-27T15:12Z,"@skillet92: You should bookmark my page and load torrent immediately as I put'm up. That way you would have good download. But:
Stop ALL torrents while downloading one. Start them later on.
You must find can you or can you not connect to my seeding server. It's damn important... if you cannot, you have either bad settings or you have blocked IP address (your PeerBlock or even your provider maybe) or range where I  am seeding from."
,skillet92,2010-10-27T18:57Z,"I actually get a low upload speed on some torrents ...thats the reason i put abt 2-3 torrents at a time!

I will load only one torrent at a time from now! "
,believenu,2010-10-28T00:28Z,seeding is sharing. Thank you. See I larned sumtin new today. I usually thank and seed but never have commented on the quality. why because all of twentyforty that I have tried is by  far the best that I have downloaded since I joined the pirate family. thank you jon for telling us. save time bookmark here and find the best here.
