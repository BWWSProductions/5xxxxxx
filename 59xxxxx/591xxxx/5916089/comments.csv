She opens it to a guy, ""Hi, is Tony home?""

The wife replies, ""No, he went to the store, but you can wait here if you want.""

So they sit down and after a while of silence the friend says ""You know Sara, you have the greatest breasts I have ever seen. I'd give you a hundred buck just to see one.""

Sara thinks about it for a second and figures, what the hell - a hundred bucks! She opens her robe and shows one to him for a few seconds. He promptly thanks her and throws a hundred bucks on the table. They sit there a while longer and guy then says ""That was so amazing I've got to see both of them. I'll give you another 100 dollars if I could just see the both of them together.""

Sara amazed by the offer sits and thinks a bit about it and thinks, heck, why not? So she opens her robe and gives Chris a nice long chance to cop a look.

A while later Tony arrives back home from the store. The wife goes up to him, ""You know, your friend Chris came over.""

Tony thinks about it for a second and says, ""Well did he drop off the 200 bucks he owes me?"""
