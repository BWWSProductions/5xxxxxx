Todays Parents. November 2010.

Today's Parent magazine is published 12 times a year, serving moms 
and dads of children from birth to age 14. Articles, both practical 
and philosophical, tackle the complete range of relevant issues, i
ncluding health, education and behaviour.

Enjoy.

I wonder if it tells you how to deal with hoodies and delinquent kids!
