Bananarama with Fun Boy Three - Really Saying Something [promo].VOB



HQ rare promo music video. "He Was Really Sayin' Somethin' is a soul song 
written by Motown Records songwriters Norman Whitfield, William "Mickey" 
Stevenson, and Edward Holland, Jr. in 1964. The song is notable in both a 
1964 version by American Motown girl group the Velvelettes, and a 1982 hit 
version (with the title altered to "Really Saying Something") by British girl 
group Bananarama. The 1982 single became the second consecutive top-five hit 
for both Bananarama and Fun Boy Three, peaking at number five in the UK singles 
chart. It also received heavy play on the then-young MTV network in America.
