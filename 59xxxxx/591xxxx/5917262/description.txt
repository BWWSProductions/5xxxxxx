Another movie poster was released for the upcoming romantic drama In Your Eyes starring real-life couple Anne Curtis and Richard Gutierrez and award-winning actress Claudine Barretto. Iâ€™ve posted a more detailed plot summary below.

The sisterly love is what most siblings look forward to in search for a family bond away from the comforts of their home. The sisterhood of Ciara (Claudine Barretto) and her younger sister, Julia (Anne Curtis) leads to a treacherous interest leading to sacrifice love for the pain that will eventually bring joy to them.

The movie is set in the urban area, in the city of bright lights, America. The two sisters were caught in an unexpected love triangle with Storm (Richard Gutierrez).

Will you sacrifice your happiness when your own happiness already found another joy? Will you still fight even if the leaves of your heart wither from pain and sorrow? Will you surrender your felicity for the sake of replenishing your sisterâ€™s own happiness?

Love, Betrayal and Sacrifice doesnâ€™t always end with a good ending. In the end, destiny will find its way to bring together true love. But with whom?
