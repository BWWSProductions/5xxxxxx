,bookworm1960,2011-05-20T05:07Z,"^ That's because of the way files are handled by the bittorrent protocol.
It sends ""pieces"" of files, which may be pulled from anywhere in the file.
A file may have 2 or more pieces.
An ISO file, or an MKV file, can have hundreds, even thousands, pf pieces.
A piece often ""bridges"" 2 files
Therefore, when a piece arrives and is scanned, there is no header present, and that raises a red flag right there, and the byte sequence can look like malware.
It is only when ALL the pieces of a torrent have arrived that the file(s) scans clean."
