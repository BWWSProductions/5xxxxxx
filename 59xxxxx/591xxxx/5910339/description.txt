              As ruthless apprentice to Darth Vader, Starkiller was      
              mercilessly schooled in the ways of the dark side,         
              commanded to exterminate the last of the purged Jedi       
              Order, and groomed for the ultimate Sith power play:       
              assassination of the Emperor. He served without            
              question, killed without remorse, and lost his heart       
              without warning to beautiful Imperial fighter pilot        
              Juno Eclipse, never suspecting that he was just a          
              tool in the schemes of his masters-until it was too        
              late to escape their lethal betrayal.                      
                                                                         
              Juno mourned Starkiller as dead...but now he is back,      
              purged of all memories and programmed to kill. And as      
              fate brings Juno and Starkiller closer to reuniting,       
              with Darth Vader determined not to lose his assassin       
              a second time, they will both have to make a stand.        
              The prize is freedom. The punishment for failing           
              will be eternal enslavement to the dark side of the        
              Force...
