I hate playing a game vanilla, and after playing New Vegas with a couple of mods you will too. A lot of the "new" features in NV is was implemented thanks to what the mod community did in in FO3 (Hardcore Mode etc.)

So, I created this easy-to-install modpack with some of my favorite mods.
No executables, just unpack into your game folder and tweak some settings.

Mods included in this pack:
- MTUI by Max Tael
- URWL for New Vegas - Realistic Lighting and Color by Marcurios
- Bottle That Water by LFox
- Realistic Repair Lists by defear
- Sprint Mod by Lork
- d3d9 awesome perf fix by wing pao shiggz
- Goacbcs Freeplay after MQ by Goacbcs
- FOOK - New Vegas by The FOOK Team
- Better Binoculars by Kobu
- Fallout 3 Walking Running Animations Restored by supertoby
- New Vegas - Re-Animated by Alendor
- T3T Misc Item Icons - New Vegas by The 3rd Type
- Better Headshots by Kitteh
- Bullet Time by Dunderklumpen & Clanfear
