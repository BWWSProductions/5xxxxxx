Gave this album a listen and is it just me or does it sound very loud, as in there's little dynamic range?  Nothing against the uploader, it's probably how the sound engineers produced the CD.  It just annoyed me at times, especially when she's singing along with back-up singers - it sounds like a high-pitched Alvin and the Chipmunks album, with the needle in the red most of the time."
