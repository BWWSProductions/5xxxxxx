GpsGate for 64-bit / x64 Vista and Windows 7

If you use 64-bit Vista please follow those steps.
(If you are unsure, simply install GpsGate normally first, if Virtual ports does not work - follow those steps)

1. Install GpsGate for Windows 2.6 build 340 (or later)

2. After installation copy the file 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Franson\GpsGate 2.0\x64\bizVSerialNT.sys
to C:\Windows\System32\Drivers

3. Exit GpsGate (if running)

4. Run GpsGate as Administrator once. (Right click on the GpsGate icon in the Start Menu and select "Run as administrator")

Now the 64-bit driver is installed. You can exit GpsGate and run it as a normal user.
