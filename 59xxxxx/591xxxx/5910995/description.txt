-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This adventure game, the first ever released by Her Interactive, lets you 
take on the life of a teenage co-ed in her junior year at Madison High. In 
this role, you'll do everything a girl of this age does in her daily life at 
home, school and work -- from deciding what to wear each day to going to work 
after school. Talk with friends in person and on the phone, attend classes, 
study, do homework, shop for clothes at the mall and go out on dates.

You choose one of two characters to play. Besides your 6 closest friends, 
there are 20 other characters to meet during the course of the game - 
including prospective boyfriends. The scenarios are presented by way of video 
clips. Conversations come about by selecting one of several provided replies.

There are various types of mini-games to solve within the game including 
variations of Concentration and Tetris as well as a shooting accuracy game 
and a picture puzzle.

The game comes on 6 CD-Roms: 1 for the main game, 4 for the main boyfriends 
and a bonus music CD. A optional complete internet access package is included 
on the discs. The PC version box also contains some makeup and tips on how to 
apply it, and a pink ribbon promoting Breast Cancer Awareness.
