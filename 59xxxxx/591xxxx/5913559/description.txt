Plot summary

Richard returns home from military service to a small town in the Midlands.
He has one thing on his mind: revenge. Payback for the local bullies who
did some very bad things to his brother. At first his campaign employs
guerrilla tactics, designed to frighten the men and put them ill at ease.
But then he steps up his operation, and one by one these local tough guys
are picked off by the terrifying angel of vengeance that Richard has become.
