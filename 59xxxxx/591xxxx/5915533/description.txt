"Having previously released two albums, Distorted Disco and Electrolove, both given away for free earlier this year, prolific up-and-coming electronica producer Drew Harris who hails from Victoria, Canada, and has remixed the likes of Crystal Castles and Futurecop, as well as previously releasing â€˜Pulsesâ€™ featuring German dance-punk kings Digitalism. With a heady mix of electroballadry, 8-bit and synth-pop influences, the record sounds not unlike Germany Germanyâ€™s compatriots Holy Fuck and Crystal Castles, with a melodic pop sensibility that makes him sure to appeal to a wide range of ears.

One blogger recently declared, â€œI have a feeling that if this guyâ€™s jams keep improving at this pace theyâ€™ll end up saving mankindâ€, and the title track from Radiowave was recently included on a compilation released by dance blog Poule dâ€™Or, alongside the likes of My Tiger My Timing and Kitsuneâ€™s Gamble & Burke. With a European tour planned for next year (with the first confirmed show, naturally, in Germany), this young burgeoning talent looks set to have a big 2011, and THaF Records are hopeful that he will go on to fulfil his huge potential."
