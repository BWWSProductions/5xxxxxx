OK friends, this upload is made for no profit at all, it is a labour of love. If you know the quality of the magazine then you know you have to download this. 

It is highly recommended that you burn it using DVD Decrypter, that was the tool I used to rip it, I use it too when I need to burn a DVD9, I know there is also Imgburn but I prefer DVD Decrypter when the iso was made with it, don't forget it.

The older issues of SLICES are out of print now, so if you have some, please share them here. 

This upload could take about a week or so to complete, so please return here and comment if you were succesful when burning it, remember it is a DVD9!.

And PLEASE BUY THE MAGAZINE! the team behind it makes an amazing quality work so they deserve to be paid for it.

I'll upload my other SLICES dvd when it is out print ;)
