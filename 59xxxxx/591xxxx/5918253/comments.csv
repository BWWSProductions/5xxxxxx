Otherwise, I have no idea what one you could mean, unless you're thinking of another band doing the song... it wasn't a CCR original, anyway."

,biffbiffson,2011-09-20T21:48Z,"Great torrent! Good bit-rates! I got most of the albums and the only ""trouble"" one was ""The Concert"" from 1980. It didn't have tags, but if you use mp3tag, fill in the artist, album and year manually, then use ""tag sourcs>freedb"" and you should get your tags! Enjoy!"
