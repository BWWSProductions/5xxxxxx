,SmoothWeiner,2010-10-26T02:39Z,Saudi Arabia...the Bastion of human rights?
,SmoothWeiner,2010-10-27T04:34Z,Muslims may not have rights given by birth....but the rest of us do.  Thats why the Muslim world is stuck in the 7th Century...and oppression while the West has progressed.
,martsego,2010-11-26T21:09Z,"A RELIGION -THE ONLY ONE SUCH- LIKE ISLAM WHICH DENIES THEIR PEOPLE THE BASIC HUMAN RIGHT TO CHANGE ONE'S MIND AND ABANDON IT, WHICH IF DONE CARRIES PENALTIES OF VARIOUS KINDS, HARASSMENT, BEATINGS, PRISON OR EVEN KILLINGS, IS NOT A RESPECTABLE RELIGION AND SHOULD BE TREATED BY ALL GOOD PEOPLE ON EARTH AS AN EVIL, DESPOTIC AND INTOLERANT SECT."
