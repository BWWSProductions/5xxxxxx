Plot summary

Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy romp around like
coked-up versions of The Three Stooges in the frantic Disney romp Hocus
Pocus. The film begins in 1693 where three witches -- Winifred (Bette Midler),
Sarah (Sarah Jessica Parker), and Mary (Kathy Najimy) -- are preparing a
potion that will grant them immortality and eternal youth. But before they
finish mixing their cocktail, the people of Salem capture them and execute
them for practicing witchcraft. Before their deaths, they vow to return to
Salem 300 years hence on Halloween to exact their revenge. Three hundred years
later, a skeptical, newly transplanted Californian, Max (Omri Katz), explores
the ruins of the legendary witches' house and dares the witches to manifest
themselves. Disregarding the warnings of his sister Dani (Thora Birch) and
girlfriend Allison (Vinessa Shaw), Max lights the Candle of Black Flame. With
that, the witches reappear to wreak havoc on the town. The kids take off with
the witches' spellbook and a musty tome of hexes and recipes. The sorceresses,
who will die by the morning light if they don't recite the incantation for
immortality, have to get the books by whatever means they can. So, Winifred,
Sarah, and Mary hop on their broomsticks for a chase through Halloween night.
