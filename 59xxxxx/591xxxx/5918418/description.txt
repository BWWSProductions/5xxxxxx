NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Eat Pray Love 2010 R5

Right here we are running late again with this one.....anyway we used laps audio as it was the best out Thanks LAP
used the russian dvdr.
Now once again the r5 dvdr was poor by the normal standard so we think.It was way too dark and colours too
strong and also off.
Anyway we made a script to fix the colours the best we could and also made it alot brighter ..roughly + 10 on brightness
alone + we added our normal resize,white balance etc..

Enjoy folks
