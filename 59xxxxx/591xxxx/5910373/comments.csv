,nosferatu501,2010-10-30T19:42Z,"Damn, cant get this to work for some reason. It installs ok but then when i try to open a video for splitting it crashes on me. I think it might be something to do with the new MKV splitting ability as i can re-install and use the older versions without any problems. Anybogy got any suggestions as to the problem? Damn Boilsoft haven't even got a forum of help section i could find either. Anyway cheers for the upload."

""Boilsoft Video Splitter has two different splitting mode, Direct Stream Splitting Mode and  Encode Splitting Mode.

Direct Stream Splitting Mode only supports splitting file to source file format. Formats including AVI, MPEG, VOB, MP4, 3GP, RM,ASF/WMV/WMA, MKV and MP3 are all supported.Output file quality is the same with source video/audio quality. Splitting speed is extremely high. Split 10 times faster than the Encode Mode.

Encode Splitting Mode supports splitting any format video to any format and output to any format file as you like. Supports nearly all kinds of video formats."""
