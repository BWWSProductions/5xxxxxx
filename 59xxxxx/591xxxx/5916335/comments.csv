,ghayss_94,2010-11-01T11:42Z,"can i just install the 2nd DVD on my normal edition version?

and what are the differences between these editions?"
,Cashy57,2010-11-01T22:52Z,"@ghayss

Yes! To my knowledge, you should be able to. If not, you can just copy your saves folder onto your desktop and then uninstall the game and then reinstall using disc one. Although I don't see why just installing disc 2 wouldn't work. And, I believe there is no difference between the GOTY edition and the regular edition other than there being all the expansions already with the GOTY edition. 

Hope this helped,

,Barboron,2010-11-07T17:14Z,"Downloaded this, straight away figured out your problem there Farrahgo. Go download Games for Windows Live client. Just google it and it will come up. Under Live, get the client. Open it and sign in using your windows Live ID and BAM! Can run the game perfectly!"

,powder17,2011-09-24T07:24Z,It sometimes freezes for me when i try to enter buildings. And whenever I leave the game to the desktop it won't let me go back to the game. Any advice?
,iRodney,2011-09-28T03:50Z,"For those who are new to this, or are having trouble, just do thisL

1. Download the torrent.

2. Go to where you saved the torrent download, and click on DVD1 GAME.
  -You should see Disc1(no addons)

3. Get a virtual device, and mount the .ISO to it.
  -I prefer Daemon Tools Lite. You can use a different program. Daemon Tools Lite is free if you want to download it, google it.

4. After that part, it should be pretty straight forward. A window should pop up. Click the launcher. Setup the game. Easy as that.

Disc2:
Basicly do the same thing.
Do step 1 the same.
In step 2, go to DVD2 ADD ONS instead of DVD1 GAME.
  -You should see Disc 2 (addons) in this folder.
Do step 3 the same exact thing, but with Disc 2 (addons)
Step 4 is exactly the same aswell."
