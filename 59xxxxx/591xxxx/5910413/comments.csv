,ppereira1,2010-10-25T19:57Z,"thank you bone =)

haven't seen the whole movie 'cause i have to go out but it's the real filmed movie ;)"
,referhead,2010-10-27T01:50Z,"yea rars are so hard. click, click, wait 15 seconds, done..... real hard."
,TheLizardKingMike,2010-10-27T08:27Z,"What sucks about when people release video as RARs is that there is absolutely no compression. You don't save a single byte of disk space, so in essence, you are wasting your and everyone else's time. It's not so bad for the downloader, because it only takes about 20 seconds to unpack, but it takes much longer to archive."
,Puma__84,2010-10-30T07:33Z,can someone post pictures from the movie
,ppereira1,2010-10-30T13:54Z,"@ Puma__84

,ENCode001,2010-11-03T06:20Z,"The REASON for RAR'ing a movie has never been about COMPRESSION. NEWBS always think this. There are multiple purposes for RAR'ing a file besides saving disk space. The reason is so that if the file get's damaged or corrupt, instead of re-downloading an entire 650-1400mb movie, you re-download a single.rarpart maybe 15-25mb. at most you'll re-dl 2-3 parts totaling 45-75mb. "
,BerkoDaxter,2010-11-06T13:08Z,"good file, fast speed. thanks for upload"
,ianpark01,2010-11-06T14:27Z,"@ ENCode001 ... i use bit comet... ok sum folk say its guff... but there is a log tab for each download... i dont like downloading rar files either... but ive never got corrupted or damaged files doing otherwise... when a torrent is created its hashed into peice parts, bit commet hash checks each peice part and if it is corrupted or damaged will drop it and redownload till it finds a clean 1 so its bugger all to do with whether its rar'd or not in my books"
,jordie00000,2010-11-15T10:26Z,"@ referhead 
haha it is soooo true it could be one of the easiest things to do other than downloading torrents from pirate bay "
