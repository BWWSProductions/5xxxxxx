After examining her, the doctor explained that the wasp was too far in to be reached with forceps. He suggested the husband try to entice it out by putting honey on his penis, penetrating her and withdrawing as soon as he felt the wasp.

The man agreed to try, but because he was so nervous, he couldn't rise to the occasion. ""if neither of you objects,"" the medic said, ""I could give it a try.""

Under the circumstances, both agreed. The doctor quickly undressed, slathered on some honey and mounted the woman. The husband watched with increasing alarm as the doctor's thrust continued for several long minutes. ""Hey, What the hell is happening?""

""Change of plans,"" The physician panted. "" I'm going to drown the little bastard!."""
