Program #3003 - Auburndale Project

The morning starts with the arrival of a 17â€footâ€long steel beam that weighs 900 pounds. It
will carry the load of the house over the 16â€ft. opening that was made in the rear foundation
wall. Because the site is so hard to access, general contractor Tom Silva uses a crane to lift it
up and over the house and place it carefully on a temporary wall near the installation site.
Then, host Kevin Oâ€™Connor and Tomâ€™s crew lend a hand installing it. Master carpenter Norm
Abram meets with product specialist Bill Gaines to see the insulated concrete forms being
used not only for the foundations, but also for the aboveâ€grade walls on the new additions.
Inside, Kevin welcomes Chris Kimball from Americaâ€™s Test Kitchen, to help us understand the
â€œtime capsuleâ€ of a kitchen that we have from 1940 and where the new design is headed for
our homeowners in 2010. Back outside, the forms are complete and the concrete truck
arrives to pour the foundation and walls. At the end of the day, Tom and Kevin discuss how
the new lead laws affect interior work and how to properly test for it. Using proper
protocol, the kitchen is gutted and the wall to the dining room comes down.
