Montag the Magnificent (Glover) is a master illusionist who performs at underground 
venues, selecting female volunteers from his rave-like audiences. To their hysteria, 
it appears he's dismembered their bodies, but his sleigh of hand has fooled them. 
However, female bodies show up dead from the same wounds performed on stage. 
Investigators are baffled, and the chase to find the killer begins.
