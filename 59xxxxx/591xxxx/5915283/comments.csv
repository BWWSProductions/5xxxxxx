Now, I've been obsessing over this the last few days and I think I might now what's wrong but I have NO IDEA how to fix it. 

I looked over the files on the emulated drive and I noticed that two executable files in the Game Bin seem to have the wrong extensions, so basically there are two files in the .iso which are wrong but I can't correct it cuz I don't have the 'authority' to rename them. 

It's TS3EP03.ex_ and Sims3Launcher.ex_, which I think the extensions should be .exe???

,gachoi06,2011-10-26T04:56Z,"I copied the files over to the Game/bin folder but it still gives me that error of not verifying that the disc is valid. any other solutions??

one thing I did have to do is update my Sims 3 game and Late Night expansion during the installation. Does that have anything to do with it??"
,xpm5846,2011-10-28T16:23Z,"Hello, just wanted to ask how to mount this game as there is no iso file to do so? Thanks"
,123pda,2011-11-06T21:42Z,"I bought and install the base game, Ambitions, World Adventures, and Generations and I want to install this one until I purchase it sometime within the next week. I'm not having trouble mounting the ISO file or getting the installation file, but I'm not sure what way I should go about installing. I've seen a lot of posts that say you should put a certain file in your Sims files and what not, so I'm really unsure of what way to go about doing this. Help would be appreciated. 

Very quick download also! A bit more than an hour, I think. "
,urieaal,2011-11-06T22:48Z,"hay folks couple things here, 1st just wanted to say thanks for this i've been so bored latly and thought i would check tpb for some sims addons works perfect as is.

also was wondering because i cant find any info online, if i do a sims update (hadnt played it in a few months and theres alot to update atm) update after installing this and the crack using the key gen will i still be able to play or will the update render the crack and thus the game unusable??"
,123pda,2011-11-06T22:56Z,"xpm5846, You can use Virtual CloneDrive to mount the ISO file. It's freeware, so all you need to do is download and install it. "
,urieaal,2011-11-07T02:13Z,"@123pda you didnt really answer my question.. i already have deamon tools i use for mounting iso and image files, i simply was wondering if downloading the EA updates for the Sims will render the Currently Used key from Keygen and The crack / patch that came with this download inoperable from updating all my sims files through There updater.

i have all the legal and store bought versions of pretty much every other bit of sims 3 just can never find late night at the store so i opted to download it."
,123pda,2011-11-07T02:24Z,"urieaal, I didn't answer your question because I addressed my answer to xpm5846. Haha. In fact, I'd like to know the same thing you're asking. 

If you go on the Origin site and search Late Night you can buy a digital download for 39.99 and download it right then and there... seeing as you said you couldn't find it in stores. "
,urieaal,2011-11-07T07:36Z,"yah i thought of that but i live in a rural area surrounded by trees and back through a dirt road lol.. or my connection is 30 kbs at most and through a usb modem so downloading almost 7gigs of data takes roughly a week and through anything other then a torrent or simialar when my connection drops so does all the data % of downloads.. unless its a torrent since you can just restart were you left off lol.. part of the reason i've been looking in my local walmarts/kmarts and fredmeyers.

but honestly no one knows, should i update will it make this version un-usable? i wouldnt care but late night seems to have a crap load of buggs. Pathfinding is horrible my sim literally pauses and waits 30 sim minutes to turn a corner and yes other sims are moving or standing around. also there seems to be some crap where my sim wont do much of anything even if i que it up prior for a good 5 sim hours being a firefighter has never been more of a pain in the arse."
,PixL33T,2011-11-07T12:59Z,"Great dl!
Startet 5 mins ago, allready at 15,5%, 4,5 mb/s 
- great seading"
,urieaal,2011-11-07T20:45Z,"and yah fyi downloading the update does in fact stop late night from running im guessing you could just mount the iso/disk image file and run the game that way instead of cracking it (i should have know better)

but alas now i had deleted the iso after cracking it and can not for the life of me find a 6.5.1... version of the late night no-cd crack arggh!"
,urieaal,2011-11-07T21:05Z,"alright guys, heres the no Cd crack i found and its working so happy gaming. although i had to run the game from the 

C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 Late Night\Game\Bin/TS3EPO3.exe

rather then the launcher.

kinda disappointed no one answered though and i had to spend a few hours traversing the web and trying multiple cracks to get this...."
,urieaal,2011-11-07T21:10Z,"my bad disregard the last post about it working was all excited because it launched but it still needed the disk when i got to my charecter selection 

so if anyone figures anything out please lut me know by posting on here..."
,urieaal,2011-11-07T23:18Z,well any ways i found a way to get the game running with the current update. If your used the crack to originally run the game and dont have the iso any more  you can download a mini ISO/disk image which is working for me. aparently cant post the link on here... so just google Late night mini iso.
,O_OAlexO_O,2011-11-12T15:18Z,"Hey this is my first time downloading a torrent, i think i did everything right, mounted the ISO and cracked it, however the game says that i need to insert a sims 3 late night disk, any help on this? Thanks :)"
,whizcuz,2011-11-12T19:23Z,"@ O_OAlexO_O I dunno why it would be telling you that you need the disk. If you checked in the Crack folder and copied the TS3EP03 and TSLHost.dll to the Game/Bin folder, then it should be fine. 

However, I am having trouble authenticating the disc since it's telling me so. I didn't exactly use the keygen provided. Would I have to reinstall Late Night?"
,mirandatheloser,2011-11-24T00:38Z,"okay so i know nothing about anything so can someone tell me how to burn or mount an image and why i need to (what does it do?)

you can email me at mirandatheloser@gmail.com! thanks."
,Malina1019,2011-12-07T13:53Z,"far out ive already done 3 of these, so i know how to do it.. but this one wont run anything in it... it keeps giving me error to everything.. all the launchers and setups and what not.. fml"
,dafaq,2011-12-14T07:44Z,Works perfectly fine!!! tahanks DjAligator!
,Alezga,2011-12-30T15:06Z,"Meeeehh..... I will kill myself.None of late night torrents work on my computer...
There's always the same message when I try to start the game ....( btw. i copied crack into my sims3 basic folder...) 
It says something is wrong and I have wrong version,something like that..."
,Missus420,2012-01-11T01:47Z,"All i got when i downloaded was about 70 files that end in ""r"" and then a number. Not one iso file or crack folder. WTF?"
,tpbhej,2012-01-29T08:46Z,"there is an error, it says: who found no game disk insert the game disc"
,fenixjv9999,2012-02-09T16:07Z,"PLEASE HELP i installed and cracked late night, but when i try to launch it and click play button, the game won't start..before late night i installed master suite stuff and now master suite isn't working either (the same story here..when i launch it, it won't work...)"
,rezabrando,2012-02-19T08:54Z,Great upload. LOLz at N00bs!
,JulianAlexandr,2012-02-20T04:26Z,I get an Unauthorized Disc Failure message. Can anyone help please? Contact me @ jayrockxz6699@aim.com
,kasperable,2012-03-19T20:31Z,"Alright, so I've done everything that I'm suppose to. Didn't update, have the crack in the proper folder while replacing the old files, no custom content, launched from the programs file, still have the iso mounted, but I'm still getting the message that says it can't verify my disk.

I'm wondering if maybe the crack just isn't working for me, or maybe It's because I have origin installed? Ahhh I really don't know.

Anyone else have this problem who has solved it?"
,dbass11,2012-03-27T14:08Z,i have installed the game and copied the crack to the bin folder it launches and then after opening they say i need to insert disk. what do i do??
,destiny333,2012-04-08T12:45Z,"@kasperable I have the same problem like you. If you solve it please leave here a message. 

Please can any one help what to do when the game write a message ""we can not verify your disc, if it is the original copy The Sims 3 Late Night please call the customer service"". "
,prplxr,2012-04-18T20:04Z,"I honestly hope that this isn't some kind of ""Swedish only"" version. The installation program was in Swedish and I really hope that it's because I currently AM in Sweden. My original The Sims 3 is in English."
,aperson101,2012-05-05T00:05Z,Thanks soo much!! It works perfectly! i really appreciate people who upload torrents like this. It's ridiculous how much they charge for expansion packs!
,CrazyAaron84,2012-05-12T07:47Z,"works perfectly fine as long as i keep iso image mounted lol... guess ill keep it there permanantly... i think there should be a way to crack so you can run without mounted image... both crack files were copied and pasted over into the appropriate files but game does not run when image is not mounted
thanks anyways for upload :D"
,offensus,2012-05-12T23:36Z,where is this image i have to mount??
,turtule,2012-05-26T14:13Z,takes forever to load. help?
,dramashley739,2012-06-15T17:41Z,"guys this works GREAT for me, when its done seeding, mount it with poweriso to drive e & then GO TO COMPUTER and click drive e sims 3 ep03 to install it. let it install and play it, i had NO error whatsoever.:)"
,hannah322,2012-06-16T08:59Z,Its keeps saying the disk isnt really. What am I doing wrong?
,jermelle,2012-06-18T00:44Z,works great for me no errors at all. thanks

,AnnzyFranzy96,2012-07-03T03:13Z,I installed everything correctly and i opied the TS3EP03 and TSLHost.dll to the Game/Bin folder. Everything's fine until i get to the part where you choose your family..Then it says its not valid..?
,AnnzyFranzy96,2012-07-03T03:23Z,I'm having the same issue as kasperable & destiny333...>< It's aggravating since you can't play the base game without uninstalling the EP
,erynwatson,2012-07-04T06:33Z,when i try to copy the crack files to the game bin it sas there isn't enough space on the drive... someone pleeease help me
