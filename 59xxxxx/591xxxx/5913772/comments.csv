The status message is: ""No connection could be made because the targety machine actively refused it."" displayed on my BitTorrent 7.1 running on Windows Vista 64-bit. But with the same program I have no problem downloaded other people's torrent from this site.

Anybody know how to fix it?

My BitTorrent client now showing there are 52 seeds and 121 pears out there, amazing! No wonder the bitorrent has became the biggest file sharing net.

Cheers!"
