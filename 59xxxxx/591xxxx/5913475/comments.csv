Great..."
,Robertman20,2010-10-27T14:18Z,"@Shepard76 It's a false positive. Got it in my NOD32 and i went through the code and didn't find any problems with it. 

@oeccis have you tried running as an admin.

@bandikaa Yes... it's cracked. Ofcourse they'd be disabled..."
,josjikawa,2010-10-27T17:37Z,i dont got any issues so far and the game is working BUT..... saving doesnt work... sigh. assoon i exit it saves and just keeps a grey screen with the game in the background not responding.

What is the problem?I have win7 x64 system."
,Robertman20,2010-10-27T18:27Z,@josjikawa I have just noticed that problem just a few minutes ago. I'm going to see what may be causing the problem. Please tell my you System specs so i can find out.
,Robertman20,2010-10-27T18:46Z,I have just contacted THETA (the original makers of the crack) hopefully i will receive an answer soon.
,Robertman20,2010-10-27T18:48Z,@bandikaa That is a DLL that should be in your System32 directory. Just download it from the internet and put in your system 32 directory and it should be fixed.

,Viivamies,2010-10-27T22:30Z,"Game freezed when i went into Demon Mines at the beginning. And when I tried to reload only thing I see is black screen and I also hear the game sounds...

Same save- bug again?"
,Diaian,2010-10-28T00:01Z,"Hey. My game wasn't saving too, then i entered in the folder that holds the save ""Something like ""Loguin_Swarm"" and deleted the ""vu..."" something

then i reopened the game and it loaded my game

i don't know if this is reeeally the solution but give it a try guys!"
,StachU564,2010-10-28T01:07Z,"i had the save problem but try copying this http://www.novaup.com/download/g9qrpa7d35l1s

,jojonice12,2010-10-28T02:38Z,"Blackscreen error....but background music still on,any possible ways to fix this?"
,notdone23,2010-10-28T05:54Z,The black screen with music playing. Windows 7 doesn't come with Direct X 9. goto microsoft.com and download/install Direct X 9.0c That fixed that problem. Course now i have the Save problem i'll see if the fix works for that. 
,notdone23,2010-10-28T06:22Z,The fix Robertman20 put up in another torrent works. You can save your game. It also made me reinstall the game and i had to chose a different path or i would get an error rewriting deathspank.exe if i put it in same place the previous install was in. 
,Robertman20,2010-10-28T08:29Z,@notdone23 I had no problems copying the crack in my other torrent into my older directory. I copied and played without installing. Do you have UAC turned off and if not did you accept the administrative rights??
,moreghan,2010-10-28T12:54Z,when i click on download this torrent i get: No input file specified. Anybody know what to do about this?

,wichax,2010-10-30T11:08Z,"This ""team"" of crackers are noobs, let this to the guys who CAN upload games such as Razor, RELOEADED och SkidRoW.

,fightingnet,2011-03-14T17:21Z,"dear,
        robertman20 i understand the situation for the error""no input file scpecified"" kindly delete the torrent,request the moderators for the hash to be cleared and re-upload it.
thanking you

,dgeddes,2011-05-12T05:58Z,"some of what @Diaian was saying.

I was having trouble with a blank screen whenever i tried to load a saved game. 

A solution i found was to go to the deathspank directory and find a file name ""Dallas_swarm""

where your name is instead of Dallas.

1.change the folder name to something else.
2. start up the exe file.
3. yo should see that you cant continue your game
4. close the game, delete the new folder with only the 'vuid' file
5. rename the previous folder you changed the name of back to its original.
6. start up the game again and it should work.

worked for me at least. 

this game is a good laugh."
