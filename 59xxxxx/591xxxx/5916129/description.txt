Warner dumped all of the Trey Parker and Matt Stone audio commentaries off of the episodes on their South Park: The Complete First Season DVDs. But Comedy Central.com is offering all of the commentaries on a multi-disc CD set as a bonus if you buy the DVDs through their website. Sez Matt Stone of the commentary:

"Warner Brothers would not release it on the DVD without editing some of its content for "standards" issues. Trey and I simply love the sounds of our own voices to let this happen. We also believe in a little thing called the First Amendment. After you hear it you may wonder "What was the big deal about it anyway?" Good question. And one better directed at Warner Brothers than at a TV screen. So let them know what you think. Trey and I did. And enjoy our first ever sober audio commentary."

Note that you can also get the bonus commentary CDs by sending in your proof of purchase with a small shipping and handling fee to Comedy Central, and they'll mail you the CDs. You can visit Trey and Matt's South Park Studios for the address information soon.
