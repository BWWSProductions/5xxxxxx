Softwarez (or Noir) would not have put out a movie labelling it an R5 if it was not quality.  You can be assured it is, screens or no "

...yeah, unlike that 2 Lions Team who are just full of crap lies nowadays, labeling quality on their shitty uploads. so lame. really sacrificed their reputation"

Seriously, this is the WORST film I have ever seen with George Clooney in it.
It has no direction, no real storyline and no decent dialog.
Watch it if you must but I think that you will be as disappointed in it as I was.
(Particularly in the ending where George dies, along with this film)

,scottielass,2010-10-31T03:47Z,"Well, I've just finished watching it and I thought it was terrific -- and Clooney was perfect in the role, along with the rest of the cast. Not all films have to have happy endings -- and this ending was the only one that would have fitted with the rest of the movie it was played brilliantly. Pity MaXiLeeCH had to reveal the ending though -- that's not nice.

BTW, quality is perfect, thank you."

,PakstarDT,2010-11-03T05:36Z,"Hey, can anyone post screenshots ? I want to download the torrent but want to see if screen is good."

thx upper!!"
,asheepie,2010-11-07T13:50Z,"MaXiLeeCH: He doesn't always have to star in typical Hollywood movies, though he does that well too.

Also, you're a dick."
,Panthror,2010-11-08T20:55Z,"This movie was directed by Anton Corbijn, who also made Control: The Ian Curtis movie, a bunch of video ckipos for Depeche Mode songs and even the Coldplay video ""Viva La Vida"", although his version was replaced by the record label. Don't expect an action-packed feature, that's just not Corbijn's style. I say: Anton keep up the good work!"
