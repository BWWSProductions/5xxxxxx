,TaZeRz,2010-10-30T22:08Z,"Video : 1280*688

Then its not quite 720p is it? How hard is it to make a proper rip god damn idiots."
,u9hq5yqh,2010-10-31T01:22Z,"tazerz, you cant make it 1280x720, because the movie wasnt filmed that way. it was filmed with a wider aspect ratio"
,Avantiel,2010-10-31T01:37Z,Must love when idiots dont know what 720p is. Great upload
,JUSTlN182,2010-10-31T07:25Z,"@TaZeRz You dont even know what you're talking about when you say 720p, 1280*688 IS 720p so stop complaining when someone is taking their time to provide you a perfectly good rip"
,zaqaz,2010-10-31T09:16Z,"@TaZeRz you fail, DibyaTPB rulez, me lolz"
,the_arrow,2010-10-31T14:14Z,"The information is wrong, there is no subtitles included in the rar or embeded in the mkv."

,Volbla,2010-11-03T01:44Z,"And this is precisely why torrents shouldn't be rared. It is completely unnecessary, and since i have to unrar it it takes up double space on my hard drive.

But other than that great upload. Thanks, man."
,killen76,2010-11-03T22:07Z,i just wonder why is it so slow to download? have downloaded for 3 days and i only have 12% somebody knowwhats wrong?
,BioHaZZarD99,2010-11-14T23:50Z,"@Volbla

Raring is better then a single file. Download is corrupt only have to re-download bad part, not entire file. With movies I don't care if rared or not. non-rared just lets me play over network instead of un-raring to local drive."
