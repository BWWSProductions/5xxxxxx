,moncho5,2010-12-02T08:35Z,"Sorry but I install the game in windows 7, I have been playing for one hour or so and suddenly... my AVG antivirus detected something and I had to restart the PC and the Program was erased (the .exe).  So.... "
,elektronik_supersonik,2010-12-11T13:15Z,I'm using Microsoft Security Essentials and I don't think I've ever had that kind of problems with false positives.
,mckenzie2467,2011-02-27T06:56Z,"I just downloaded it... I have windows 7 and have been using avg for years... it works fine... I just played the 'endless' for nearly an hour... take it, no worries... unless you don't know what the hell you're doing... then LEARN before you run your mouth.... make sure you HAVE a problem before you scream PROBLEM; 'cause there is none here! And BTW, rocket scientist, his name seems to be blaze and you called him blitz... we found your problem... YOU CAN'T SEE...  putz..."
,Chuce,2011-03-06T23:31Z,"blaze69 has fuckin' VIP status... I don't know how you get it, but I don't think it's by uploading viruses. I haven't downloaded it yet but will comment afterwards."
,Chuce,2011-03-06T23:55Z,"It works and I played for a bit. It's an .exe file, which I never download, but it is real, thank you blaze69."
,TheBLUR88,2011-03-23T16:15Z,wow........just wow Chuce you are such an ass goto hell and in the future don't comment negativly and insult b4 u have even d/l'd
,Z_V,2011-05-22T17:51Z,"@theblur88: Try reading and comprehending what was said before running off at the keyboard. The guy didn't say anything negative about blaze. There was a ton of sarcasm in his post towards the guy that did speak negatively. 

About the torrent. Downloaded it for the wife and it's playing great. No problems and a big thanx to blaze69 for the up."

,ryeder5,2011-10-16T07:51Z,"All you bitches yelling ""Mah shitty anit-virus has detcted a TROJAN!!! DON'T DOWNLOAD!"", I have Norton anti virus and this program is as sensitive as the nerves of a praying mantis and when I installed and played for good few hours, IT DIDN'T DETECT SHIT! So get this torrent and play, it's clean."
