,born2bealive,2010-10-28T08:55Z,You totally rock dude- my cable company can't afford to pay channel 5 here in NY- so Fox 5 simply cut their channel from cable- I'm 43 and have never not had a basic channel my whole life- I still pay for my cable tv- but about 4 channels that fox 5 owns are no longer working- It's pathetic- I can't wait for the two company's Fox and Cablevision to reach a deal b/c I'm definitely not paying for the month without it- so far it's going on 3 weeks where they can't reach a payment agreement.. Grrrrr  So basically I can't watch the world series.. so please keep posting these for us here in NY??? Thanks man.
