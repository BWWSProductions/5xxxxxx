Release Notes:
Blurred the black box at top. Blurred out all the property of tags. Had to split the movie into over
60 parts to blur them all. Did a re-encode using a new white color correction filter a buddy made
for me. Audio is my usual remastered 5.1 AC3. A lot of was put in but it's just fun for me just to
see how good it can be done.. Well Enjoy //iNK
