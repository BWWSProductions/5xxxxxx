| Bloid  is a metalband  which started  out in  february  2006.  With  several |
| experienced metalheads from other local  metalbands, a new and loud band was |
| born in Alkmaar, North of Holland.                                           |
|                                                                              |
| Bloid means  'happy' in  dutch  dialect.  Happy name,  heavy music!  What is |
| interesting about Bloid is that it is  not a typical metalband with an angry |
| attitude.  Enjoy to play  music and having  fun is much  more important than |
| creating an heavy image.  This attituce  has brought the  band a lot of gigs |
| and created lots of goodwill with bookers and venues.                        |
|                                                                              |
| Bloid is Rijnes on bass and vocals,  Jeroen on guitar and vocals and Daan on |
| drums. Watching Bloid live is fresh and heavy at the same time. Enthousiasm, |
| energy  and power  are  just a  few  key words to  describe  the  Bloid live |
| sensation: Metal at its best!                                                |
