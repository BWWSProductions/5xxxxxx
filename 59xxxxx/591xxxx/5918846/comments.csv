This is a very deep game and works well on many levels.  I have not yet finished it but have had a gripping couple of days' entertainment with it.  It is something different and challenging with a unique backstory lurking behind the game.  I would not recommend it for kids, though.  Some pretty deep psychological stuff going on here. 
If games keep getting better, as this one promises, folks who are less able to relate to the world outside their computers are in for a gratifying game-life."

,hillneerg,2012-04-22T23:58Z,"Some games for XP/Vista won't work on 64 bit systems. If you are running Vist or Win7 64 bit, you are out of luck. No way around it (compatibility mode won't work either). You need an updated version of the game (if they make one).
You just get the icon as you say."
