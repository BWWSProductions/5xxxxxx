As expected from a 600MB 720P movie, there's severe macro blocking and loss of detail in any of the scenes with rain, action, or camera pans, especially the opening sequence.  The quality is ok as long the camera is still and there's very little movement.  If you're replacing a crappy XviD copy this is better, but if you have a nice H.264 DVD-rip, stick with that until a higher bitrate 720P torrent is available."
