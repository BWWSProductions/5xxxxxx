,Reqrezentin,2010-10-28T18:37Z,Obama is fucking awesome
,seedammit,2010-10-29T01:46Z,"THE WORST DAILY SHOW EVER!

We all know Jon is democrat leaning, but this was ridiculous, it's pretty much Obama campaigning.

Watch and puke next

and I'm not republican at all

hell I'm not even american"
,erikk11,2010-10-29T05:55Z,As a fellow non-american I have to agree. There's something about a president that makes all americans mesmerized into making them look like a saint.   I just watched Frost/Nixon (2008) and it is the same thing. 
,erikk11,2010-10-29T05:57Z,everything the president does turns into his campaign
,HelloDolly1,2010-10-29T13:32Z,"seedammit, it's a comedy show - not news. What did you expect, when a politician in an election year shows up on tv?"
,makeyoubleed,2010-10-30T10:38Z,"dont be suck a racist...
Obama sure beats the hell out of that scumbag jackass Bush."
,kkbop,2010-10-30T16:47Z,"@makeyoubleed: How is saying that Obama is president PUKE or saying that Stewart is kissing the president's ass racist?

Criticizing someone doesn't make you a racist just because of their skin color? Remember?"
,rannug_1,2010-10-31T03:14Z,"Obama got asked tough questions, and allowed time to answer..... and ofc he's defending himself, and YES Steward is left-leaning, but he asked tough questions about Obama's promises. You guys complaining don't really care about the answers. So go out and vote for a corporation owned republican muppet instead if you feel that way."
,rannug_1,2010-10-31T03:22Z,"All you haters... Obama came on to deliver his message before an election and chose Steward because he is popular AND left-leaning. There's nothing mysterious here. Yet he got asked tough questions about his promises, but you don't really care do you, you just hate. Man I'm scared by USA, where evolution is a sin and equality is only for the rich. Thank God for Steward and Obama."
,rannug_1,2010-10-31T03:26Z,"seedammit, I didn't puke, but that's because I'm notpre-determined and narrowminded like you are. He came to speak his mind, and got asked tough questions about his promises. This is the best interview with the president ever."
,rannug_1,2010-10-31T03:33Z,"sry for posting 3 times, I didnt think my posts went through :/"
,seedammit,2010-11-06T07:11Z,"I've watched dozens of Jon Stewart's Daily Shows, What I complaint about is that this was by far the worst: boring, Jon wasn't funny as usual, the president wasn't at his best, it was just plain campaigning.

This isn't a news show, is COMEDY central, remember?

Jon usually gives the guests a tough time, hits them where it hurts, cracks some jokes, and they end both laughing.

Facing Obama he just looks like he's looking at his idol, everyone has a right to have political preferences, but come on, the show comes first.

If he was interviewing Bush or some one he strongly disagrees with, then we would have an epic show."
,cursdsfuk,2011-06-04T03:45Z,That's right wing research for you. He was not campaigning for election because he took office in 09. The first time he was on the show he was campaigning. I think that was in 08. Besides this is not the place for a political debate. If your that desperate for someone to tell you how right you are go to the Fox news website. Then you can spend the whole day having people tell you how smart you are no matter how stupid you or your belief system is.
