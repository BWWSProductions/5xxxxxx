INSTALLATION NOTES

Install TuneUpUtilities2011_en-US.exe. Copy contents of the
Crack folder to the installed folder of TuneUp Utilities 2011
making sure to overwrite the existing files. Next import
Registration.reg into your registry by double clicking the file

*OPTIONAL*:

Use any registration info to register the program and not use the
Registration.reg file. This is done from the About tab. TuneUp
Utilities 2011 is now fully registered! Enjoy a non-blacklisting
version, use a serial without our crack and you will get
blacklisted eventually

NOTE:

This will work fine with the GB installer and the build number
will be lower from that setup, but its the exact same version
2100

Thats it! Enjoy
