I picked up this gem at a used record store. The lable said "near mint," and that was only a slight exaggeration. This is a wonderful sounding pressing of one of my favorite albums. I split the album into five tracks because that is the format to which we are accustomed. I used the preset named "Old Record - Quiet Audio" in Cool Edit Pro's Click/Pop Eliminator on the first 21 seconds.I used Click/Pop Eliminator's "Fill Single Click Now" option to eliminate two other pops. No other noise reduction or editing was done.I also included cue files that divide the album into the twelve tracks that are implied on the album lable. Just open the file "Multiple FLAC (5 files, 12 tracks).cue" with foobar or AutoFLAC if you would like the five files displayed as twelve tracks instead of five.

The album was transcribed on a Technics SL-1200MK5 turntable with custom 
modifications by KAB Electro-Acoustics using a Stanton Groove Master II 
cartridge with Pickering elliptical stylus, also from KAB. The preamp was a 
Velleman 8021 Control Amplifier. Analog to digital converson to 24-bit/96kHz was 
with an E-MU-0202. Recording was on a Sony VAIO desktop computer with a 3.0 GHz 
Pentium IV processor using Cool Edit Pro 2.1  at 32-bit/96kHz, floating. Extra 
"silence" at the beginning, end and between sides was trimmed in Cool Edit Pro. 
No volume adjustment was required. 

I found the "static" during the quiet beginning of track one to be distracting, 
so I used the preset named "Old Record - Quiet Audio" in Cool Edit Pro's 
Click/Pop Eliminator on the first 21 seconds (seconds:frames).I used Click/Pop 
Eliminator's "Fill Single Click Now" option to eliminate two other pops. No 
other noise reduction or editing was done. Cues were dropped and named and the 
file saved as a 24-bit 96kHz type 1 wav. This file was opened in GoldWave to 
extract and save the image cue file. Metadata was added to the image cue file 
using foobar. The multiple files cue was created with CUETools (www.moitah.net). 
Both image file was split into tracks, compressed to FLAC and tagged in 
foobar2000. M3u files were created with mp3tag.
