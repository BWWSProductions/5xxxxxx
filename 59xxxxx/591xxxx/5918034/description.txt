The 2nd Volunteer Jam was released in the form of a movie. It was billed as the "First Southern Rock movie," even appearing in theaters across the US. The movie was re-released on DVD in 2007. Regulars at the Nashville Volunteer Jam concerts included the late George McCorkle, Jimmy Hall, Dickie Betts, Henry Paul, Dobie Gray, the late Toy Caldwell, drummer Gary Pacemaker, and others.
In 1979, Lynyrd Skynyrd reunited for the first time since the 1977 plane crash, with several members of the Charlie Daniels Band. CDB keyboardist Taz Digregorio took lead vocals on "Call Me The Breeze" followed by an extended instrumental version of "Free Bird." In 1987 Lynyrd Skynyrd returned to the stage for only the second time, also at the Volunteer Jam.
