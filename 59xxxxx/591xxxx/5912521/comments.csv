,wontpayforit,2011-02-18T00:11Z,"Regarding your troubles with host files named ""host"" without an extension please consider this file is a system file and normally hidden from view to most users.

You may open and edit it using wordpad or notepad but when you save it you should save it using a .txt extension to it.

Then delete or rename your original etc/host file to host.old before renaming the host.txt to host without an extension.

Thus you bypass the issues with the host editing failing.

Also note, you may have to make sure your folder permissions are set under the tools / folder options advanced tab to display hidden files, system files and do NOT exclude/hide known extensions before you can see this file.

On the question ""Why do I have to uninstall older versions, can I reinstall them later""

No you cannot because the fonts and other material delivered in the versions of CS from 4 and up are restricted to licensing of the font material and other addons.

If you for instance copy Myriad Pro from photoshop CS4 to an XP system using PS 7 you will find you cannot use the myriad pro font because you dont have the proper license level of the system.

You can also not for example reinstall PS7 to a system where you have PS CS4 or higher running as it will conflict with the registration of other file content.

(This is the shorthand version of info and not the complete ""help me why can't I""-explanatory)"
,vindikate,2011-02-21T10:00Z,what is the password? please ;)
,bashprompt,2011-02-25T15:00Z,"Is there a apssword on this rar? Someone want to grab this, crack it, re-up it pre-cracked in an unpassworded rar? I've got a few fat links I can seed a few terabytes through if you're willing to pop up a better format than this. Please don't bother replying if you cbf'd pre-cracking, pre-cracking is essential as it guarantees you won't have to spend hours fucking around finding key gens."
,FxB10K,2011-03-06T02:33Z,"Hey, I have an issue... 

The ReadMe says I should replace hosts files with the one in the folder, but there is no? :/"
,klokked,2011-03-07T01:16Z,"@Fezilk24, thanks a ton. Serials worked perfectly. The other ones that were given didn't work."
,louist44,2011-03-12T19:57Z,"Works fine.
The slickinator window crashed after i extraced the fonts, after that it would not open at all :(
sent it to the recycling bin and then restored it to get it working again. the music was not my style but a nice addition :P

download, edit host files, turn off internets, install, from the slickinator window go into the crack tab/option and copy the small file and paste it into all CS5 applications with the same file. done

virus free

Someone have the pass?"
,danconia3873,2011-03-24T05:41Z,For some reason the program won't start at all.  Any idea as to what's up?
,db78636,2011-04-08T19:43Z,"k, so the trick to editing your hosts file in win 7 & vista is to: 

1. Run notepad as administrator

2. Browse to hosts file from within notepad (C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\)

3. Now, click where it says, ""Text Documents (*.txt)"" and change to ""All Files (*.*)"" You should now see a few files including hosts.

4. Open hosts file and edit.

4.5. Save hosts file in current state as hosts.old for backup purposes. To avoid confusion later, make sure it is saving as ""all files"" and not ""text documents."" 

5. Save file as ""hosts"", making sure it is saving as ""all files"" and not ""text documents.""

Done
"
,db78636,2011-04-08T19:45Z,Just want to clarify. Do step 4.5 before 4 if you want to save backup. 
,db78636,2011-04-08T19:57Z,"Also, if you are using Spybot Search & Destroy, you're not going to want to replace data already in hosts file. Instead just copy this part:
