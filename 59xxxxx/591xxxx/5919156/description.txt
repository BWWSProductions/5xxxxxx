What can I say, this album is awesome. Very well developed, blending together a ton of styles with everything from uplifting trance to some jaw-droppingly hard house and happy hardcore. A pretty enjoyable album, on the lighter and more friendly side of JCore music. I think it's one of M-Project's better albums, and it really depends on your tastes. If you like sophisticated, emotion-inducing, and complex arrangements, this is likely not the album for you. If you enjoy simple, fun, bouncy patterns with creative synths, then give it a check.

Recommended tracks:
After World (JAKAZiD's ahhï½žfter world Remix) (Light Trance/Happy-Hardcore), a really fun and uplifting track which I will be blasting out the car stereo for many days to come.

The Future Is Now (DJ-X LAB4 Remix) (Makina/Hardcore), it draws you in to its epic creamy center of hard dance music.

Cloudy Heaven (JORDI K-STANYA Remix) (Light Makina_, once again, really uplifting and entrancing;

Get Naked (Massive Remix) (Hard House), some really powerful mixing and just full of energy.
