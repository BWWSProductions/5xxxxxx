,strmprpl,2010-10-25T17:06Z,"No Heidi series?
Do send me the link to the torrent.

Also, any good rip of Despicable me?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-25T17:56Z,"@strmprpl : Please, reread my answer."
,lilars26,2010-10-25T18:42Z,"Thank you 20-40.Is it safe to update?Can I now replace ConvertX-DVD with this?I installed everything except mpc player which I already have.Stuttering has stopped,I guess from Core AVC.Is there anything else we should know about settings or are they automatically set to best performance?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-25T19:52Z,"CoreAVC: Input Levels Auto detect
                Output levels Auto detect
                Deinterlacing: *Hardware or *None (deint. could be switched on only for usage with some DVB cards - ALL encodings are either progressive or decombed already.)
               Input Colorspace Auto detect
               Deblocking: Standard (crucial)
               * Crop 1088 to 1080
               * Use tray icon

Marking and un-marking ""Preferred decoder"" is explained in long torrent description. One can use DivX Player for all needs, without any necessity for any codec - player even has own subtitle filter, only font must be chosen according to one's localization.

For Windows Media player (fastest, and I use that) CoreAVC, Haali splitter, DivX (for AAC sound), AC3 filter (for 2.0 and 5.1 AC3 sound) and VobSub (for subtitles if needed) must be installed. Sound levels for AC3 filter should be adjusted in Control Panel. AC3 should be associated ONLY with AC3 and DTS (Settings-System).

MPC is just best alternative, preferred by many. He use CoreAVC, DivX AAC (and H264 filter too, if CoreAVC is ""un-ticked"") and other installed codecs.  MPC need not any installation, can be copied in Program  Files folder or anywhere else. In my case, I have set in Options DirectSound as audio output and VMR7 as for DirectShow video.

That's all, probably..."
,lilars26,2010-10-25T20:59Z,Thank you.
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-25T23:37Z,"err.
