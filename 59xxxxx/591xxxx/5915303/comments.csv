,RudeGurl,2010-11-27T16:56Z,Thanks to the uploader and seeders :)
,glahnt,2011-06-01T16:58Z,"Uh, several of these are mislabeled. 106 is 108 and vice versa. 115 and 116, too. We'll see how many more. Not that I expect all uploaders to be geniuses, but c'mon. This seems pretty basic."
,glahnt,2011-06-02T01:24Z,"Also, episode 119 is missing. Some real Einsteins uploading this stuff, I see. Needless to say, I won't be seeding this. I don't like to spread idiocy around."
