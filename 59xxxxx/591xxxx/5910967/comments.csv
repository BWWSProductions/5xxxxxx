,Lakender,2010-10-31T12:40Z,"New Vegas songs were boring as hell,even the radio dj made me sleep,I want my GNR back =C"
,rekpek99,2010-10-31T18:14Z,"i agree. although i find nv in so many ways better then f3, their choice of music definetly wasnÂ´t as good... what annoys me the most, is how often the same songs are repeated. but i liked, that they used some of the in-game music of f1 & f2 (plus original badass enclave power armor, yeah!). btw, in case youÂ´re playing on a pc, you should check out new vegas nexus. loads of new songs there, that fit into the setting."

,rekpek99,2010-11-23T11:47Z,"hmm, i`m looking at my torrent in utorrent right now and all the files are, where they are supposed to be. check the last 15 files and you´ll see they`re there. i just saw, that someone took my songs for his own torrent, so obviously, they are all downloadable."
,Anathema117,2010-12-03T22:05Z,You are missing the casino instrumental songs from what I can tell. 
,Cyrez60659,2010-12-19T14:44Z,"OMFG this torrent is poor. You're missing so many songs, including the two I really wanted.

Lazy Day Blues
Roundhouse Rock

Make a proper full soundtrack torrent with these songs."
,rekpek99,2010-12-19T22:17Z,"well, iÂ´m sorry. since youÂ´re asking so nice, i might just stop with my christmas preparations and the rest of my regular life and search for the songs that youÂ´re missing... OR
you could look for yourself and upload the perfect soundtrack (or any torrent, an idea you didnÂ´t have so far, as i can tell from your profile) instead of complaining to people who give you stuff for free.
to everyone else: i realize, that this collection is really missing more songs than i thought. as soon as i have some more time, i might put up a better torrent. merry christmas!"
,Crash556,2010-12-28T02:47Z,Some of the MP3's dont work with my iTunes.  Might just be my version but fyi.
,Cyrez60659,2010-12-30T15:56Z,"@rekpek99

LMAO! Are you angry because you're so retarded that you couldn't do something as simple as compile a full soundtrack? You obviously had the game to rip it from, you just missed a few tracks 'cos you did a shoddy job.

And don't give me that crap about 'complaining to people who give you stuff for free' since none of this music is your own. You ain't a fucking saint you dumbass.

Lol @ how proud you are for checking my profile and seeing there's no torrents. (Clever boy! You are a bit special huh?) I have about 50 different TPB accounts.

In short, go screw yourself. I'll do what you failed to do."
,unrena,2011-01-02T21:28Z,"@Cyrez60659

Sounds like you need to get a life. Good job on having ""over 50 different accounts"" on a website that only requires one, unless you're an idiot and get yourself banned for trolling. I thank rekpek99 for his time and for making this torrent, it's wonderful. And if you're going to gripe about something he did, lets see your compilation of FNV songs. Oh wait, someone's too lazy and knows he would have done a ""shoddy job"". So have fun scrub complaining about me writing this to you, I really doubt I'll be reading anything you say on any of your no life accounts."
,hckrwolf,2011-01-17T08:17Z,"quality ranges from an impressive 320 kbps to a disappointing 80 kbps and the soundtrack missing a few songs here and there..... that being said, this is the best copy of FNV's OST out there right now, so thanks to rekpek99 for sharing with us. hopefully a better copy will come along soon, but until then, cheers."
,hegel5000,2011-05-12T00:50Z,"Thanks for putting this up, rekpek.  I feel great not having to use up all of ffshrine's bandwidth for once.  And I downloaded this for New Vegas's original score, not the oldies stuff (if I collect that music then I'd have complete artists' torrents of it, right?), so your torrent is perfect for me.  Again, thanks."
,Brettyo,2012-01-04T23:05Z,"@Cyrez60659

stfu prick... I can't believe how fucked people are -_-

Great upload, thanks so much!"
,alexgw,2012-02-06T18:18Z,"Hey, I was wondering if you also have the Mysterious Broadcast from FNV: Old World Blues?"
,therhymesmatter,2012-03-18T02:02Z,thank you for great torrent!Top Quality
,Joshman13x,2012-06-15T20:47Z,I don't know if anyone else noticed but some of the songs are different versions from the ones used in game. They're the same songs but different versions. Seeding anyway.
,moviedude19,2012-07-03T23:36Z,"Don't complain about the torrent...

If you have the game, just get the music from the game files? 

Takes all of five minutes to fix the names so they don't say ""MU_So_And_So"". 

Kids today."
