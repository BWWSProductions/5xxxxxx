this torrent consists out of two things: first of all, there is a collection of the songs you hear on the different radio stations in the game. sinatra, dean martin and all the other good stuff. please tell me, if i forgot any songs, should be complete though.
and then you have a direct game-rip of all the music originally composed for FNV by mark morgan & inon zur. all credit for ripping that stuff goes to "thomandandy" from the ffshrine forum, where that stuff got uploaded to in the first place. all files are mp3s.
