PLAXIS is a finite element program for geotechnical applications in which soil models are used to simulate the soil behaviour. The PLAXIS code and its soil models have been developed with great care. Although a lot of testing and validation have been performed, it cannot be guaranteed that the PLAXIS code is free of errors. Moreover, the simulation of geotechnical problems by means of the finite element method implicitly involves some inevitable numerical and modeling errors. The accuracy at which reality is approximated depends highly on the expertise of the user regarding the modelling of the problem, the understanding of the soil models and their limitations, the selection of model parameters, and the ability to judge the reliability of the computational results. Hence, PLAXIS may only be used by professionals that possess the aforementioned expertise. The user must be aware of his/her responsibility when he/she uses the computational results for geotechnical design purposes. The PLAXIS organisation cannot be held responsible or liable for design errors that are based on the output of PLAXIS calculations.
