An even stronger follow-up to the strong previous effort Ancestry, Kiyoshi
Kitagawa and his trio hit a home run with this superb album. You can't expect
anything less than spectacular when you have Kenny Barron and Brian Blade
watching your back, but this trio has apparently matured in the intervening two
years.

They dig deeply into Kitagawa's five originals as well as compositions by Wayne
Shorter, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins and Ornette Coleman. The interplay is
somewhat looser and there is more excitement in the air. Kitagawa's bass chops
are on full display on "Oleo," a duo treatment with Blade, and album highlight
"Lonely Woman" where he shows off his awesome bowing skills.

If you liked the trio's Ancestry, you will love this 2005 recording. Engineer
Mike Marciano did an excellent job and the sound is nothing short of
amazing. When you listen to this album, you've got to crank up the volume!
