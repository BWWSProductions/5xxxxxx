SYNOPSIS

Set against the breathtaking backdrop of the Himalayas, Blindsight follows the 
gripping adventure of six Tibetan teenagers on their journey to climb a mountain 
in the shadow of Mt Everest. A dangerous journey soon becomes a seemingly impossible 
challenge, made all the more remarkable by the fact that the teenagers are blind. 
Believed to be possessed by evil demons, the children are feared by their parents, 
scorned by their villages and rejected by their Buddhist religion. Rescued by 
Sabriye Tenberken, a blind educator and adventurer who established the first 
school for the blind in Lhasa, the students invite the famous blind mountain 
climber Erik Weihenmayer to visit their school after learning about his conquest 
of Everest. Erik arrives in Lhasa and inspires Sabriye and her students to let 
him lead them higher than they have ever been before. The result is nothing 
anyone could have predicted.
