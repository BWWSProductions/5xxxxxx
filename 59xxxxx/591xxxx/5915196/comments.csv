,Acidyen,2010-11-01T09:47Z,"First, thanks for the upload. I do have one question though. While playing, I am experiencing lag spikes where the game starts to slow for a few seconds and the announcers voices are in slow motion as well but then it goes away. I'm aware it is no fault to the uploader :p 

If anyone else has experienced this, did they manage to fix it with some setting changes as I'm sure the reason this is happening is due to some settings I have(or don't have)

Thanks again for the upload
Muchas gracias Sonyds"
