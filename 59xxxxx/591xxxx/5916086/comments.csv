The mother being startled by this thinks quick and finds the closest dictionary and opens it up to a picture of a cat and says ""Son, that is a pussy."" the son then asks ""What's a bitch?"" The mother again thinking quickly opens to a picture of a dog and says ""Son, this is a bitch.""

The son walks away still confused, and sees his father watching television. The son walks up to his father and says ""Dad, what's a pussy?"" The father doesn't want to miss the baseball game so he quickly whips out his Penthouse magazine to the centerfold, grabs a marker and draws a circle around the vagina and says ""Son, this is a pussy!""

The son, now starting to understand what the older boys are talking about asks ""Then, what is a bitch?""

The dad replies, ""That's everything outside the circle!"""
