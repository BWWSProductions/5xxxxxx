[V],Lindoff41,2010-10-30T17:45Z,"I enjoy is very much, thanks again"
,Shoobox,2010-11-26T23:36Z,"to bad ya couldn't get these down to at least 350 or 400mb,
   13gb is taken forever for one season to download,
but thanks for the effort."
[V],meech,2010-11-27T13:35Z,"Shoobox:
If you want 350mb rips, they are already out there.  Just do a search for Farscape and you will see some 350mb rips.  My rips are meant as an alternative to the average standard 350mb torrents.  You will find that these are a much higher quality.  Not only do I turn the encoder settings way up, I leave enough room (size) for the encoder to give it a higher bitrate.  These are meant for those who aren't worried about space (hard drives are so cheap nowadays), and want a higher quality.  Download time is the sacrifice one has to make to enjoy a higher quality t.v. experience.  A good internet connection shouldn't take too long to download.  If you want 350mb files, they are out there...no need to download these."
,Shoobox,2010-11-27T21:31Z,"@ meech
im not concerned about file size, i have over 5 tb of space, 
im running a good connection at 28 Mpbs down and 16 Mpbs up,
and my client is optimized and my download through this is only 35.5kb.
connection doesn't matter if noone is seeding or setting up their client rite.

if you want to be technical:
 comparing season 1&2 with the 350mb to yours season 1&2 600mb i realy don't see a difference on my 52"" flat,
but i do see the the difference on season 3&4 of your 600mb slightly better than the 350mb."
[V],meech,2010-11-29T04:31Z,"Shoobox: Not seeing a difference on your t.v. isn't very technical.  Xvid tends to smooth the picture out which often tends to cover up low bitrates or encoding options...however, detail quality is often lost.  h264 is widely considered to be superior than Xvid for this and other reasons.  Although higher bitrate doesn't always mean better quality (x264 options are as important), it can certainly make a difference.

I personally noticed a significant difference on my 50-inch and so I ripped the entire series and thought I would share with others.  I never saw the show before and wanted to get into it, and I am a stickler for quality.

As for the download speed, I can't control the seeders or leechers.  So complaining about the file size won't help.  Sounds like you already have the 350mb files you want.  So if you really don't perceive a significant difference, then you might as well not waste time or space downloading these larger files."
,Shoobox,2010-11-29T22:03Z,"meech
as you stated seeing it on my tv and viewing it on yours is different but consider this my dvd has upconversion as well as my 52"" tv so whether i have a 350mb file or 600mb file, the will be no difference in viewing,
 but not everyone has a high end big tv, and will be able to notice the minenute  difference in your conversion, im well aware of how conversion works and whether its xvid or avi or divx or hd or what have ya, without proper codec conversion the is no real difference.
   When some converts over to dvd for viewing, not avast of people use their pc for viewing movies.
and last no one is complaining just stating that you claim a good connection will download fast but that is not true. without proper seeding ,client config, ect ect. 
a 24 minute tv show at 600mb can easily be converted down to 350 or 400mb with minimal lost of file degration. and play clear on bigger tv,
it just depends on how you use and what type of codec you use."
,Shoobox,2010-11-30T23:29Z,"my correction error  ""42 minute tv show."""
,Stat969,2010-12-22T16:14Z,"i disagree enormously with shoobox. the 350mb episodes are full of blocking and artifacting. they are very distracting to watch.

these encodes are near-perfect. i can see the difference on every screen i use - a CRT monitor, LCD on my laptop, and 37"" SD plasma screen - and the difference is enormous. it's like night and day.

i can still see some occasional banding and blocking in smooth flat gradients on these ones, but on the whole they are about as perfect as you could wish for. "
,soldierofthelam,2011-01-16T23:43Z,"@Stat969
I know what you are saying but there is really no different in upscale conversion which is what shoobox said.
i have upscale conversion too and there is no difference in 350 to 599 file size.
Im not sure how old you monitors or tv are but when i tried out the 350 file size i've seen non of the blocks on or distortion as you described,
it all depends on how you convert with what codec, you can easily get the file size down to 400mb with same quality as 599mb without degridation loss"
,kianaica,2011-01-25T06:13Z,"totally awsome rips meech save me many hours of ripping my dvd's for easy access.

one small problem though S03E20 goes slightly out of sync"
,ONeg,2011-02-20T08:28Z,"I disagree with shoobox as well. I've got a 42 inch VIzio, hooked up through my XBox. I remuxed them all the AAC-MP4s and they look brilliant. You can easily tell the difference from Xvid rips.

If anything, the show feels less dated, because of the quality. Much appreciated."
,soldierofthelam,2011-02-20T14:28Z,"@ONeg

I really don't think you people screaming ""I hooked it up to my big TV knows whats your saying.""
 Of course if you hook it up to your big Tv its going look good with this rip.
what shoobox said was it can be compressed lower and retain the quality for easier download.

I can tell you right now the Sorenson Squeeze 7 encoder can encode it down to 375 to 400mb without it being pixelated or blocky or lost of thread level."
,Shoobox,2011-02-21T10:08Z,"@ONeg
Again people do not read and comment with half azz statements.
1st.
 I had said ""upscale conversion""
2nd. 
if you use the proper encoder.
3rd. 
why do you people keep referring to Divx,  "" i have spoke of nothing about Divx Files.""
4th. 
VIzio's are pieces of junk and your just paying for the name. "" look at the return rate and repair rate of those T.V.'s junk!
5th.
Once again people comment without being clear ""how are you watching it? converted back to dvd?, keeping the mp4 file and streaming?
don't comments against something with a half azz comment!!"
,bart001fr,2011-09-18T14:33Z,"meech,

Thanks for these torrents. I had seen part of one episode when it was originally aired at a friend's place and I didn't have a cable connection. I always meant to buy the dvd's when they became available, but they were priced out of reach $80+ for half a season!

I have all seasons coming in right now. Season 1 shows 8 of 127 seeds connected with a dl speed of ~ 7kBps for an ETA of 3w5d. On the other hand, The Peacekeeper Wars is showing 13 of 43 seeds connected, speed 40 to 50 kBps, ETA 17 to 20 hrs.

So rates vary widely, but your torrents are still very much alive.

I only wish the first Farscape comics was showing some life. I show 2 seeds and 4 peers but no one is connected.

Thanks for your torrents. "
,Grand-Grimoire,2011-09-25T07:26Z,awsome i love this show...thanks...will seed
