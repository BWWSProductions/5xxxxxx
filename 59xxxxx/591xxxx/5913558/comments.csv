I then extracted the iso and removed the mac files, which usually works fine.  However, the newly created iso and the 4 gig dvdr burn I did, both said the fullbuild_p06 file was corrupt.

For some reason, trying to burn this iso as is to a 8 gig dvdr doesn't work, nor does converting it to a dvd5 iso. 

I had a similar issue with the Saboteur, which was also an EA game.

It's a bit confusing because most people rar the iso and the keygen together but in seperate folders instead of one inside the other.


Found this on another page. It's definitely key info that was left out. I was wondering where the hell the crack folder was. This should solve most problems. Especially those with the game verification issue"

Ok

1: download the sims 3 reloaded from AiTB on here if u havent done allready, install that and just make sure u dont get download manager.

2: download this, wen its finished downloading, open any one of the rar files and extract the iso file, this may take five mins or so.

3: use a mounting program to mount the iso file, i use power iso which is free and good.

4: go to my computer and right click your virtual drive and click open, then you have all the game files, double click autorun and the installer will come up.

5: wen it asks you your sims 3 needs updating, click yes to update wen thats done u need your cd key.

6: whilst still having the iso open go into the folder called Crack and double click on the file called rld-s3e3 (this is the key gen) generate a key and copy paste it to the installer wen you need too.

7: install game, do not install download manager wen it asks.

8: now its installed go to the games directory C/program files/electronic arts/sims 3 late night/game/bin. and go to the crack folder on the iso where u got the key gen from, and copy the file called TS3EP03 paste it into the games bin folder and replace the previous one.

IF you are getting the error message before the install wiz even starts stating the game copy is not within the same region you will need to edit your registry for win7 users go to run and type in regedit and go into HKEYLOCALMAHCINE - SOFTWARE - WOW6432NODE - SIMS - SIMS3 - Proceed to edit the file type labled ""SKU"">double click and change the value to ""2"". That should get rid of any regional code error some are getting.
2)Install World Adventures.
2)Install Ambitions, WHEN IT ASKS TO UPDATE, DO IT!
3)Install Late Night, WHEN IT ASKS TO UPDATE, DO IT!
As for any other errors I'm not sure! If anything it's most likely a problem with your hard drive or video card.

,ebuddha,2011-06-22T20:06Z,"to update a crack sims game. you have to download the latest game updates for both the base game and any expansions the same way you downloaded the game, which is via torrent or direct download from where ever that may be. so you need to be aware of what the current update is, i.e. it's version number (1.xx.xx.xx) and then you need to locate it somewhere other than the EA or the EA launcher, i.e. here on the bay. and the way to make a game work is to place the latest expansion available's crack, in to the base sims 3 game/bin folder, not in the ex. pack's folder. so if you had all the packs including generations, you update everything via torrent including the base game, and then you take the generations cracked .exe and place it in the base sims 3 game/gin folder, and make a shortcut to that to start the game."

,AssAssInGR,2011-08-03T00:59Z,"Here's a compete beginner's guide on installing this expansion:

0. Install The Sims 3 (preferably from Razor1911's torrent) or else the expansion won't work.

1. Download Daemon Tools (Alchohol will probably work as well)

2. Unrar the files. (Just click on the first one and the rest will be extracted as well.)

3. Mount the .iso file that appeared after the extraction. How to do that: Go to your desktop's taskbar and right click on the Daemon Tools icon. Then go: Virtual devices > Add SCSI virtual drive. Select the virtual device you just made and then ""Mount image"". Go to the folder where the game was downloaded and select the .iso file

4. Run Sims3EP03Setup.exe. Considering you're using a pirated version and you haven't bought The Sims 3, you will be asked to update the game. Click on Yes and procceed with the setup. When you're asked for a serial, use the keygen ""rld.s3e3"" in the Crack folder on your virtual drive. Your AV may mistake it for a virus, but it really isn't. Once the setup's finished, remember to UNCHECK the ""Download EA Download Manager"" button or else it might spot your pirated version.

5. Open the ""Crack"" folder on the virtual drive and move its contents to the Game/Bin folder on your hard drive, which is most likely located at ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 Late Night\Game\Bin"". Replace the 2 files with the ones in the crack folder. You should make a shortcut of TS3EP03.exe on the desktop if you want to start the game more easily.

6. Play and enjoy the game.

Note that you're going to have to follow a similar process when you're installing the Sims 3 (if you haven't already done that). If you download the torrent from Razor1911, it's pretty much the same procedure with the only difference being that the serial can be found in the .nfo file.

Cheers."

,Rikidou6,2011-12-02T20:41Z,"FOR WINDOWS 7 ""ULTIMATE"" USERE (cause thats what i have) ive installed this expansion and all the other expansions normally without cracks and not pasting any file into ""so and so"" folders! (that sh.t is a waste of time!) the only crack ive installed to get the game running was the ""NO DVD IMAGE"" crack from GameCopyWorld.com and of course a registration code, which isnt that hard to find. (Google is your best friend haha). all you do is mount the ""NO DVD"" image on to the ""Daemon"" or ""virtual cd v10"" virtual drive depending on which expansion your using after fully installing the game and your good to go. for each expansion you install, you will need the correct ""NO DVD"" image for the expansion you want to play. ill explain that in a minute. the way i did it was after installing the original Sims 3 game dont update it! ignore the updates for now and just install the sims 3 game. (i used Virtual Clone Drive to mount and install the game...some require u to extract the files so that the ISO image shows up..use WinRar to extract) now install your sims 3 expansion pack (mounting it and installing it) and when it says your sims game needs an update go head and do the update. now, the files and virtual drives u need to play the game are at GameCopyWorld.com. once there just keep clicking the ""main"" button on the left hand side. youll see the pics of games changing. once u see a sims 3 game, click it. it doesnt matter which sims game show up just click it. you should then be able to scroll thru all the sims games and choose the expansion pack you want. once u click it scroll all way down and u want the steps that look like this: 

Play Instructions:
Install the game - Full Installation.
Mount the NS-Sims3EP03_DC-POSEDEN.VC4 Mini-Image in Virtual CD v10.
Play the Game!

what this does is that it tells the sims game you have the dvd in ur hard drive..so in order to play u must leave this image on your desk top. u will have to re-mount it each time u turn on ur PC. ok so here are the directions:

Go to GameCopyWorld.com

the files for those instructions should be right above the directions (OH, DONT FORGET TO EXTRACT THE ""NS-Sims3EP03_DC-POSEDEN.VC4"" file you download) depending on which Sims 3 expansion you install the file name may be different. only the ""EPO3"" part will change..EP02, EPO4 etc. so go head click ""file archive"" to download the ""NS-Sims"" file and then click the ""Daemon Tools"" link to download ""Daemon Tools Lite"" and ""Virtual CD v10"". i had to use both..sometimes one doesnt work even tho it said to use the virtual drive stated in the instructions (use the drive stated first, then the other if it doesnt work). after installing the virtual drives and extracting the ""NS-Sims"" (extract to a place you can find easily like your desktop) file u now have to mount the image. but what i learned was that you cant mount the image directly from the file itself. u have to go to the virtual drive and mount it from there. so what you have to do is go to where the clock is on ur windows 7 ultimate computer (like i said, im using ultimate so i dont know if these directions work for others) and left click the lil arrow thats pointing up. if u hover over the short cuts you should see the ""Daemon"" drive and the ""virtual cd v10"" drive. do a right click on either the daemon drive or virtual cd drive. on Daemon its: right click the drive, highlight virtual devices, scroll over and highlight the device and click mount image. locate the NS-Sims file you saved and extracted earlier and mount it. just mount it! dont opened or run it at all! then click on the lastest expansion u install and ur good to go! :)

Make sure you have DAEMON TOOLS!
This is what you mount to, you can download Daemon Tools Lite for FREE at the download website.


Unrar/unzip everything and mount into your daemon tools when instructed.
Some DO NOT NEED DAEMON TOOLS!  In this case, just open the SETUP application and run it.


Install in THIS order.


!!!!!!!DO NOT CRACK ANYTHING!!!!!!!!

THIS IS KEY! 

If you crack ANYTHING during your installs you will make it so NONE of them work and you might even have problems REMOVING them as they won't even UNINSTALL correctly


UPDATE WHEN ASKED
it won't hurt and you cannot move on unless you allow the update in EACH install!
