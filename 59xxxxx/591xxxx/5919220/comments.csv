[T],Jonzee,2010-10-29T08:57Z,Great review of this bizarre thriller at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050210/
[T],Jonzee,2010-11-19T13:47Z,"Jonzee is sad to report that his seeding operation has been reduced to almost zero. I used my workstation computer at my job which uploaded at sometimes 10-12 magabytes per second. plenty of speed for seeding my 93 movies. I did this late at night when all the computer resources here at work were in disuse, but I think somebody must have complained or something, because the computer will no longer recognize my 120 GB external hard drive (on which my 93 movies are stored) without administrative privileges I won't be able to change the settings back to recognize the external HD. ordinarily I am allotted only 2 gb of internal hard drive space here at work. Not much to work with. Thanx to everyone who helped to share these neat old films, It was great while it lasted. "
