,Morpheus009,2010-10-27T17:14Z,"Is this one without 3D?

,SoftWarez,2010-10-27T18:55Z,Its in 3D. /:
[T],n2kmaster,2010-10-27T22:42Z,what kind of 3d? Red and Blues?
,ppereira1,2010-10-28T00:11Z,"it's all the same copies from .BONE.

,rowdy20001,2010-10-30T13:58Z,how do you convert it to 2D?
,SoftWarez,2010-10-31T06:55Z,You can't.
,GLMC,2010-11-02T10:39Z,"how the fuck u supposted to watch it then


*DERP*"
,Lucky13s,2010-11-04T17:57Z,"Its unwatchable if its a cam of the 3D version.

You ever watched a 3D movie without 3D glasses?
So very very annoying when everything is red and blue and each color is offset from the last so it looks like you're watching double the picture.

I mean, if you really were desperate enough to watch it you could download it, but I'd rather wait for a better non-3D version first, or actually pay to go see the movie."
,40zFundz,2010-11-06T01:39Z,hey dumbfukz you know its still jackass 3d even if it doesnt have 3d you know they do show 3d films in regular movie theatres an its the same as any other non 3d movie
,reizack,2010-11-07T22:44Z,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA all the comment made me laugh so hard!!!!!!!!
,mattballew,2010-11-16T18:05Z,"Be Very CAREFUL when downloading this. You want to stop it from seeding instantly.. 
I let it run for a few days, and got several copyright notices this morning, from Paramount Pictures. "
,jason16424,2010-11-20T08:28Z,"last time I was at the theater I watched a 3d movie and jacked the glasses you get, I will download this shat and watch it in 3d glory!

why not copy the film strip 'not the audio' and merge it slightly offset so that the misalignment of the 3d recording process is 'undone' ?"
,adeadbaby,2010-11-20T23:24Z,"people, watching this cam with 3d glasses will NOT MAKE IT 3D. i dont want to have to explain how 3D stereoscopic vision works so look it up, but you need a 3d tv/projector and the original 120 fps raw video with the frames for the left and right eye separated, this 30fps combined frame video (sadly) will not viewable in 3D :'("
,nandos421,2010-11-23T06:13Z,Seems like the file is been traced by paramount stay away 
,r1chee,2010-11-30T04:44Z,"for crying out loud its not gonna be in fuckin 3d when you fucking download it for fucks sake geez and btw thanks  ""Softwarez"""
,rubiksman,2010-12-08T21:00Z,"@mattballew What happened? Did you get fined, or what? I got a notice from them too, and i'm worried cus i'm only 15, and don't have money to pay fines. let me know ASAP"
,xmaner,2010-12-09T19:20Z,"Yes you dumb kid your going to be fined the FBI standard priracy fine 2500

Just kidding duffus if your 15 what the hell are you doing watching R rated movies. Paramont is just warning you. Next time use perrblock to keep them out"
,Bleach_freak,2011-01-04T02:50Z,I had to read all the way down just to find out if it wasn't in 3D. WTF
,lordemm,2011-02-01T04:07Z,peer block? how does that work?
