was released on July 27, 2010. It is the third album in the rapper's ""Collabos"" 
series, following the 2009 album Sickology 101. The album's name is in reference 
to the Kansas City Bar-B-Q restaurant Gates Bar-B-Q. The album's first single, ""O.G."" 
further references the restaurant....

The album will have what the artists describes as ""lighter music"" after the 2009 
album, K.O.D., took a ""darker"" approach. When speaking on the content of the album, 
the artist said the album ""is full of party tracks because I'm trying to rejoice. 
The album will also feature guest appearances by Kutt Calhoun, Krizz Kaliko, Big 
Scoob, Brotha Lynch Hung, Stevie Stone, Jay Rock, Glasses Malone, Yukmouth, Devin 
the Dude, Irv Da Phenom, and many more...
