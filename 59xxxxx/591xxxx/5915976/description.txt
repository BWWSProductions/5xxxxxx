A revised edition of a previous torrent.  

This contains the Essential Elements for strings 2000, Violin book 1, DVD and CD images. 

The only difference from the original upload is that I archived the CD and DVD images separately instead of one .rar file, so one has more choice on the download.

Please seed, it seems like there are no EE torrents on the net.
