MP3 LAME 3.98.4 320kbps
Harcore, Hard Trance, Gabber, Speedcore



The most \'angry\' of the Hardcore Syndrome albums, it has a few solid hits. Still a good J-Core album by all regards, it has less success than 1,2, and 4. More emphasis on the speedcore and gabber, which can be niche tastes.

The two big hits:
No Reason (Trance) - Joshka. Ranked right next to Serotonin 2008 (from Hardcore Syndrome 2) on last.fm, his other big hit.
Irrelevance (Gabber) - USAO. This may be my favorite gabber track, from all of gabber. It ranks around fourth on USAO\'s last.fm playcounts.
