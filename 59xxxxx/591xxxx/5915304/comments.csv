[T],HD-R-US,2010-11-02T20:08Z,"@ssitakas

If you think you can find better for the file size, then run along and do it..."
,danielnault333,2010-11-06T06:18Z,"awesome quality, your are they only guys who put some real blu-ray rip for dvd. thank a lot a+++ your movie are the best quality for dvd-r cause the video quality is blu-ray !!"

can't look better, and the sounds is not bad at all, maybe not hd, cause i guess it cant fit on a dvd-r, but wow, awesome overal"
,peterparkers,2010-11-08T14:12Z,"fyi
i tried magicISO & winrar... both wont open the iso file. (they usualy do) 
neither can i directly play the .iso in vlc as usual.

but you can extract the movie with powerISO only.
the subs wont show up in vlc.

thx, Good quality also a bit grainy."
,hauntnut,2010-11-09T06:00Z,Have your files been tested on a PS3? Just want to make sure it will play on my system before I download. Thanks!
[T],lilmjkl,2010-11-09T15:50Z,"In my opinion this isn't better than MKV. Even mkv 720p is better. I've tested it on a few Blu-ray players and not all of them can play this while MKV is playable on every Blu-ray player. This one takes way to long to burn, mount or play on your computer, MKV not. This one is 1080p but the colour isn't correct. When wachting this on a 42"" Full HD TV the colours are unreal but the MVK with the same size but 720p gets more colour wich, in my opinion, is more beautifull."
[T],HD-R-US,2010-11-09T16:52Z,"@peterparkers  Already stated in the torrent's notes that you will need a late version of PowerISO (a late version of 7-Zip will also work) to extract the files/folders. This disk image is formatted as Blu-ray/AVCHD, not DVD, so MagicISO and WinRAR will not recognise the image.

@hauntnut  Your question has been answered on 2 of my other torrent uploads.

@lilmjkl  Of course, everyone has a right to their own opinion, but you are incorrect about MKV containers. Not all Blu-ray players will recognise MKV files, and MKV is a container which can only be burnt to disk as data, not a playable movie image file. Sure, you can also drop the file onto a flash or some other drive, but then you are limited to 4Gb by FAT32 formatting, generally. As little as 3 years ago, everyone was posting on every forum how they hated MKV files, and the reason for that was they didn't understand them, and couldn't play them. After VLC, KM, and a few other media players were introduced with the correct codecs already installed to play MKV files, people changed their opinion.

It's horses for course - not everyone wants to play or store a movie in the same way, so it is a subjective argument - in the same way, not all of us are watching them on the same monitor, so the movie will be rendered in a different way every time, and it's quality will again be a subjective argument. Generally speaking, most 720p blu-ray discs look rubbish on my 60"" screen, but that's just my opinion."
,Notor1ous,2010-11-18T09:27Z,"After reading the post and figuring out how to play the file, it played pretty crapily using GOM player, but played fine with Media player classic (home cinema edition) But i couldn't seek, was only able to pause and un-pause."
,tfmoffat,2010-12-01T16:24Z,thanks once again 
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-04T06:41Z,"It's not annoying for someone that wants to throw it onto disk, but hasn't got a clue how to build a blu-ray/AVCHD formatted file/folder structure though, is it? How long does it take to extract, 5 minutes?

Sorry to waste 5 minutes of your time, but there is no one format that suits everybody."
,Screamokid,2010-12-13T02:05Z,"I'm not downloading, people say it looks and sounds rubbish, you sound like a douche, I don't want to download :)

720p look rubbish on your 60"" TV? That is the biggest amount of bullshit I've ever heard."
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-13T05:47Z,lol - and that's my loss? 
,MrSmartyPants,2010-12-31T23:13Z,Screamokid - What a *  D  O   U   C   H   E   B   A   G  *  you are.   'nuff said.

[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-11T06:22Z,"I know, I know - tragic, isn't it? 

He did post a comment on another of our releases, stating that our information is inaccurate, because stand-alone DVD players are in fact capable of playing hi-definition movies - I tried to warn him not to waste his time, bandwidth, or his mom's money, but I guess he didn't listen, and this is the recompense. )="
,Vanvanero,2011-02-11T06:49Z,Just to say thanks and keep up the good work.
,Nylleric,2011-09-14T18:38Z,"Hey guys try this codec pack, it will play all type of movies.
