These files are 24-bit 192khz. They cannot be burned to a CD, nor a regular DVD-V (DVD video). They can only be nurned to a DVD-Audio disc.
I don't know of any freeware programs that can do this.

One shareware program that can do this is Cirlinca DVD-Audio Solo.
www.cirlinca.com
it costs $44.95 to register. 

The flac files can also be played with media players such as Foobar2000.


*** following info is for 24/96 files***

There are many free media players that can play 24bit 96khz flac files. I use Foobar2000. Winamp and VLC can also play them. 
To play flacs in iTunes, try Fluke: http://blowintopieces.com/blog/2008/05/15/fluke-play-flacs-in-itunes/
or just convert to Apple lossless with XLD.

You can also burn these to a DVDR disc, which will play in your standalone DVD player.

The only freeware program I know of that does this is Lplex. 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/audioplex/
It authors a DVD-Video disc (with a blank picture) with the 24/96 LPCM audio.
It's easy to use and works. Although it works with flacs, with 24/96 flac files, you may need to decode to wav first. After processing, you will end up with an .ISO file and/or a VIDEO_TS folder, either of which can be burned with burning software (I use IMGBurn). The only config setting you may need to change is the PAL/NTSC setting, if your player only plays PAL discs. (It defaults to NTSC). It defaults to gapless playback.

Another good program is DVD Audio Solo.  http://cirlinca.com/index.htm
It can author a DVD video (with blank screen) or a "DVD-Audio" disc (need a DVD-Audio player to play those) with 24/96 LPCM audio. It's shareware and comes with a free trial and costs $45 to register.

If you want to burn to a regular CD-R, the files will have to be converted to 16-bit and 44.1khz. This can be done easily with an application like Foobar (right click on each file, and select convert). For better quality resampling and dithering, use a program like Izotope RX Advanced or Soundforge 10.
