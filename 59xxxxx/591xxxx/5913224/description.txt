Described as a "mind-expansion team" by The New York Times,
New Jersey's Monster Magnet is hands down one of the most
explosive and exciting U.S. rock bands of the last two
decades. Which brings us full circle to the impending record,
Mastermind. Saying that the album is a "return to form" would
be a severe understatement; songs such as the first single
"Gods and Punks" and "100 Million Miles" are among the
catchiest and heaviest hitting tracks in Monster Magnet's
storied catalog.
