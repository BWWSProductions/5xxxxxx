Release Notes:

The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks.
We're a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark
under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root
of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and
nothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do
this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene
started in the mid eighties.

If you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back
on contacting us as soon as possible.

On with the game release information:

The Ball is a first person action-adventure game featuring a
full single-player experience built on Epic's Unreal Engine 3
technology. As a swashbuckling archaeologist working on the
slopes of a dormant volcano somewhere in Mexico, you get stuck
in a cavern. It doesn't take long before you realize this is
more than just a cave. You reveal ancient ruins that have been
hidden from outsiders for centuries and discover a mysterious
artifact, a gold and metal shelled Ball. As you progress
towards solving the mystery of this amazing place you must
unlock the secrets of the Ball and learn to control this
ancient artifact. Venturing deeper into the volcano, you
reveal some of mankind's greatest secrets and you will start
to encounter not just puzzles and traps, but also various
strange creatures - the guardians of this mystery. These
creatures have to be overcome, using only the Ball to defend
you.
