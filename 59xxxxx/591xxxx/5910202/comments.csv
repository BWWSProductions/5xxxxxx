,kiyabaebii,2010-10-26T02:53Z,"A?
V?"
,DocEvil,2010-10-26T08:26Z,"lol wut?! I started watching this version and had to stop because the A/V quality was so bad. This was the only one I had tried, and to hear that this is the BEST copy so far? Yeah, either see it in theaters or wait for better cams.

A: 1
V: 2
Blurry, watchable, but a pain in the ass and not worth your time if you're patient enough to wait for quality.

NOTE: This version jumps randomly into some forign language audio with english subs for a few minutes at the beginning. Dunno if it happens at any other point in the film."
