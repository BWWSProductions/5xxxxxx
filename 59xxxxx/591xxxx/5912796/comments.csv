,falconss,2010-10-30T11:28Z,"thanks vicerock, buddy is that ""Uncut Version""?"
,puppyup,2010-10-31T03:32Z,Screenshots look like there's something wrong with the aspect ratio. How does it look when playing the file? Maybe screenshots are take based on file input and not output?
,falconss,2010-11-03T06:38Z,"I downloaded a watched it its fine

,Chesterton,2010-12-22T21:36Z,"@ puppyup:
you're right!

@falconss:
you're wrong!

Thanks to vicerock, but I have downloaded this together with the other 2 parts and the aspect ratio is incorrect. I get a 16:9 picture. This needs to be adjusted to 2.35:1 to get the correct ratio.
Not the end of the world, but just seems a shame to have spent time uploading without correcting this......."
,hilarleo,2012-06-21T11:25Z,"thanks Vicerock :-) This 5-hour,40-minute version is the only version I've found ""in English""- ie., English as central 'lingua franca'. Compounding this problem, all English subtitles- including the commercial DVD's - are highly inconsistent, leaving non-Francophile audiences  to guess at the action after the 2nd hour. All torrents I find (save yours) produce the same French version- but French dubbed onto an English original.
Is this confusing? Strange. It begins to suggest a subtle and complex madness, something which might appeal to Uruguay's most penetrating revolutionary mind, which is: 

Evidently this entire film production is brilliant Situationist film-making, and an attempt to relay solidarity to Agent Carlos imprisoned behind enemy lines. Free Pirate Revolution! "
