      The Who were scheduled as the second to last act (before Jefferson Airplane) to play on Saturday, August 16th. When they actually started playing it was already Sunday morning around 5:00. They played their exceptional "Tommy album", a Rock Opera dealing with the struggle of a deaf, dumb and blind boy who later finds a cure and gains stardom with his messianic movement. The presentation of the chosen songs was impressive and the magic and spirit of the music grew as Tommy reached its grande final with "See Me, Feel Me". The dawn was coming up and the first daylight hit the stage. The Who closed with "My Generation", an old hit dating back to the year 1965, and "Naked Eye". There were only a few sleepless people in the audience left who finally witnessed the ritual guitar smashing of Pete Townshend pointing out that the gig has really come to an end.  The final of this perfomance took place during sunrise which occured at 6:05 am. The Abbie Hoffman Incident was an incident that happend during The Who's set right after the song "Pinball Wizard". Abbie Hoffman was able to get on stage and grab a microphone while Pete Townshend tuned his guitar. He said: "I think this is a pile of shit! While John Sinclair rots in prison...". Hoffman was protesting against the imprisonment of John Sinclair (leader of the White Panther Party and manager of the left-winged Hard-Rock band MC5) who had been convicted and sentenced to nine years of prison because of marijuana possession. Townshend, angry that someone took the stage, yelled: "Fuck off! Fuck off my fucking stage!", hit him with his guitar and sending him off stage again. Townshend then added: "I can dig it!"; And after the song "Do You Think It's Alright?": "The next fucking person that... on the stage gets fucking killed!.  You can laugh!!" (this is hardly audible).
    
    Jimi Hendrix and his band Gypsy Sun & Rainbows was scheduled as the last performance of the festival, Sunday night, but due to several delays, they eventually played on Monday morning, 9.00 am, when most of the audience had already left. The setlist was a mixture of well known Jimi Hendrix Experience songs as well as some new material. That includes "Message to Love" (called "Message to Universe" by Hendrix), "Jam Back at the House", "Izabella" and "Villanova Junction". They added some new aspects to the rendition of Hendrix Å“uvre but generally the band was more familiar with the older songs. "Spanish Castle Magic" for instance has besides Hendrix amazing solos a small but nice rhythm section where the congas players are really audible. The blues guitar on "Red House" is immanent, always contextually responding the currently sung text line. And of course Hendrix brings out the "Voodoo Child" with its recognizable guitar signatures.
