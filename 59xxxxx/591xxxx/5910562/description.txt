Blink-182's Urethra Chronicles is a fun look at the band's hilarious antics since they formed in 1992. Each current band member (Mark, Tom, and Travis) each have a five-minute bio where they delve into the details of their private lives as well as their band lives. Five studio videos (two from "Dude Ranch" and three from "Enema of the State") plus two live songs are also provided.
