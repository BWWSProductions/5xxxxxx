I don't understand why but it wasn't uploading one bit so after a month or so I deleted it but accidently deleted my only copy.  Oh well I listened to it many times but I would like to know why some torrents wont upload at all even if there's plenty of leaches.  

There needs to be more solarity on tpb.  I know there's some on itunes.  since I will be ripping all their song from youtube I could upload a 128-256 discog if anyone would be interested."
