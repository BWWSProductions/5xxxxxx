,kurac55,2011-01-13T21:46Z,cmon what is this? Insert CD?? if this doesnt work put it down.
,rainierrr,2011-02-16T08:18Z,"Hey I found a way to ""install"" it. Right click on .pkg and select SHOW PACKAGE CONTENTS. There is a file named --instalation check-- remove it. And then run the instalation. It will ask for a license... the .NFO file shows this one: Serial: 7438-8346-3238-8347

After that, I get an error in the instalation ): I dont know if it has to do with my OSX version. I hope it serves for something."
