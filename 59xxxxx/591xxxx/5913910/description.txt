The contestants start their week hearing surprising news from host Alison Sweeney that at this week's weigh-in, only one person's weight will count for the blue team and the black team. It will be up to the opposing team to decide whose weight will count and the two contestants chosen won't be revealed until the weigh-in - leaving the blue and black teams busy strategizing on who they should choose. Then the players get a visit from celebrity chefs Curtis Stone and Lorena Garcia. Each chef is paired with a team to help coach them through a timed cooking competition - but neither chef is allowed to actually touch the food, adding to the tension as they race against the clock to finish in time. The winning team gets an advantage at this week's challenge, a dragon boat race pitting blue team vs. black. It's the ultimate test of teamwork and timing as both teams race to win the challenge and a prize that will give them a valuable advantage at weigh-in.
