,Tamarind777,2010-10-28T17:46Z,Just where in the Bible does God tell us to smoke anything? This pot legalization is a bunch of neo-hippie drug addict movement.
[T],verifire,2010-11-25T01:57Z,"@ Tamarind777: Nowhere. It says that the plants were given as food..

Hemp actually can help some people in several cases of illness and disease. Plius it's good for a lot of other things. 
It's when you eat like a goat and not like a human being you get the bad effects.. ..and genetically altered plants are not good in any case..

Not saying that I recommend eating hemp or hemp-oil. Just that it might just be that we've been mislead in some areas, even as to this..

Oh, and.. I don't smoke or grow or eat..
Did once though. Inhaled too..

Just don't throw the baby out with the dirty water, that's all I say, and keep searching for His face, all the time, no matter what.."
,CaptainGalaxy,2011-09-22T02:39Z,"@Tamarind777 Not all of us believe in the bible, but just to humor you; Where, in fact, does the bible say NOT to smoke anything? More specifically, where does it say not to use hemp/cannabis?! Because you don't have to smoke it to experience the benefits. Did you know the first bible was printed on HEMP paper? As was the American constitution. Hemp is also one of best sources of nutrition for humans on the planet, plus it can be used for combustion fuel/oil, building materials and fabrics that are way more durable and long lasting than cotton. As for getting high, you would be shocked to learn how many functional and even successful people in the world use marijuana. You should really open your mind to the facts. Everybody suffers from the war on marijuana...even if you don't use it yourself. It's killing our economy and ruining lives. It would be in this country's favor to legalize it. But don't just take my word for it...do your own research and find out for yourself. ANYWAY, can anybody tell me about the quality of this torrent? none of the others I've seen so far have comments."
