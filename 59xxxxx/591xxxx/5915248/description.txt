Developer eases Wireless Solutions development for the Java developers,
managing such development directly in a familiar environment: the Java
Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Hence, the developer will
smoothly understand the Java Card specificities.

Dedicated Java Card wizards enable easy project creation and Wireless
Applications code generation. These Rapid Application Development Wizards
are designed with valid default values (always click on 'next' button) to
quickly create an operational standard application in a real smart card.

This significantly decreases the developer learning curve and the total
development time

Test
