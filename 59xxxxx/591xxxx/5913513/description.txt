        In the post-apocalyptic future, only a few humans are left. No one 
        is able to speak; the film contains no dialogue, and characters 
        communicate non-verbally. 
                                                                           
        In the near future, a global disaster has left the world on the 
        verge of collapse. The sky rains fish; skyscrapers lie buried in 
        mountains of sand; and the few remaining humans are unable to talk, 
        \shuffling through the wasteland searching for food, shelter and 
        a glimpse of humanity. The Man longs for female companionship, so 
        he cobbles together a serviceable plane and takes off for the city, 
        where survivors shelter in the bodies of burnt-out cars. Here, The 
        Man finds himself in a bitter batter against the vengeful and murderous 
        Brute.
