This is the fourth in the series of piano-drum duos recorded by IrÃ¨ne Schweizer
for Intakt. This one with Pierre Favre, the drummer she's known perhaps the
longest since her defection from the world of classical music, is also the most
compelling by far on a number of levels. For one thing, this is decidedly a jazz
date, unlike the ones with Han Bennink or Louis Moholo. For another, there is no
fight here, no battle for supremacy or to display "chops" to the other. Over the
11 selections recorded live in Bern, the sheer musicality of this pair is
staggering. Schweizer's muscular chromaticism is matched in texture by Favre's
dancing tom-tom runs and slippery snare work. When Favre does let loose,
skittering across the cymbals and hi-hat before tearing loose on the snare, his
handiwork is met by large comped-up chords that seem to react rhythmically to
his jagged pulse on the skins. When the pace turns to dynamic sweetness and
light -- or perhaps twilight, as Schweizer's harmonic sensibility is wont to
from time to time because of her comfort with all things consonant -- and
trickles of Schubert or even Haydn slip from her fingers, Favre's brushes play
accents on the rhythm, almost inaudibly. This is a topnotch live set that
reveals piano and drum pairings are not always percussive pound-a-thons.
