,deznutts1420,2010-10-27T00:54Z,those cracks dont fix the problem with the fuse not coming out of the cannon. Anybody got anything yet on this? Or is it just a few of us with this problem
[V],blaze69,2010-10-27T05:09Z,"@ deznutts1420

Probally The game needs to be patched. Has nothing to with the crack. I don't Know Beats Me...

,jjjayjay1,2010-10-31T15:51Z,"I had the same problem guys,with the fuse removal frm the cannon... you just have to restart,the whole level from the begin, and play it all over again...worked for me... no patch ,no crack will fix it so far... but this works just fine"
,MickTrainer,2010-11-04T06:56Z,I got the game to work but all my character does is run towards me and get killed.  I do not seem to be able to control him at all.  I have changed keys in the keyboard section but can't control him at all.
,MickTrainer,2010-11-04T07:29Z,Forget that I found out what was wrong.
[V],blaze69,2010-11-04T15:13Z,"@ MickTrainer
