There are no subtitles included with this, and The Messiah, being an English work, is indeed, and not surprisingly, sung in English!"

,twistles,2010-11-08T18:05Z,"Hi blu )  And thanks for the comment.

All is well, but I have been unbelievably busy these past few months.  Thankfully, there is an end in sight!  

I do hope to still provide some interesting uploads here, although I expect to be less rather less active (my time is going to be spent between here and mvg in future, I think).

As always, if you have any suggestions as to what you would like to see uploaded (or anything else), please contact - either message here or via email (twistles-at-hushmail com). "
