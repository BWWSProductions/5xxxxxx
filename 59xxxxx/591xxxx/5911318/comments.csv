Hey, EZTV, thanks once again for such a great and timely release!  8^D  I love torrents!  Fuck television and it's commercials and scheduled programming.  That sort of brain-fry I don't need.  This torrent shit here is definitely the ultimate in watching on demand... or damn near close to it anyway.  :)

Signed,
Glitch
