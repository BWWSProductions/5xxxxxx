.: Plot :.

Frankie and her husband Mike, a manager at a quarry, have lived their whole lives in Orson, a fictitious small town in Indiana. Frankie is so far the least successful salesperson at the local car dealership, a job she explains she took only after the dentist office she worked in closed down.
Axl, the oldest, is her rebellious teenage son and was conceived with Guns N' Roses playing a significant role. He usually appears at home wearing only boxer shorts and regards any task or chore asked of him to be an enormous imposition. A handsome and confident teen, he is a school star athlete but struggles academically. Sue, the middle child and only daughter, wears braces, part of the reason for her almost neurotic self-consciousness. She attempts to cure this by frequently trying to join school organizations, but consistently fails. Because of this she has developed amazing resilience. Brick, the youngest child, is a very bright but socially awkward seven-year-old, who was given a "cool name" in the vain hope that he would develop into an equally cool kid.
