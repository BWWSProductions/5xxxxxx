,campion545,2010-10-28T17:22Z,Is there a way to get a license key for a year rather than 40 days
,coleix,2010-10-28T18:51Z,the one you uploaded yesterday or tuesday got blacklisted already. Thanks for the new share.
,Pc.HELPeR,2010-10-28T21:01Z,i use trial reset :)
,ekarth22,2010-10-29T02:54Z,"@above dudes,

don't update your Kaspersky everyday. update it on weekly basis then ur key won't be blacklisted after every few hours."
,melawons,2010-10-29T04:52Z,"Hello Hellboy, the key you have posted has always been blacklisted within a couple of days so can you please send me the key in my email  address - melawon@gmail.com
