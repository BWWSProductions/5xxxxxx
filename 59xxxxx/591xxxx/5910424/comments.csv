,o770,2011-01-13T00:43Z,Is the resolution the same as original video on disc?
,o770,2011-01-14T20:11Z,"I've got and compared this to jonny's and original EuReKA's releases and noticed colouring here is more yellowish than both others and yet this appears to have been sharpened. Has anyone noticed the coloring deviation at least?
EuReKA also has a sample available that I recommend checking.
This yellowish colouring I noticed also in Kingdom's release of the movie Zodiac and could be caused (of course) by my system decoding capabilities."

Under the information tab, on the PS3, the correct file type; MP4 is shown but there is nothing under Lenght, Resolution and Video Codec.

Does anyone have an idea what's wrong?"
