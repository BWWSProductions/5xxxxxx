,OhMyGuts,2010-10-28T11:12Z,"A husband and his wife who have been married 20 years were doing some yard work. The man was working hard cleaning the BBQ grill while his wife was bending over, weeding flowers from the flower bed. So the man says to his wife ""Your rear end is almost as wide as this grill"" She ignores the remark.

A little later, the husband takes his measuring tape and measures the grill, then he goes over to his wife while she is bending over, measures her rear end and gasps, ""Geez, it really IS as wide as the grill!"" She ignores this remark as well.

Later that night while in bed, her husband starts to feel frisky. The wife calmly responds, ""If you think I'm gonna fire up the grill for one little wiener, you are sadly mistaken."""
