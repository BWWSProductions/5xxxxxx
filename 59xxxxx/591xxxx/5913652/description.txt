PLOT SUMMARY
40-year-old Jimmy is growing up, or at least he's getting older. While 
mooching the upper bunk of his ten-year-old nephew's bed, he enjoys the 
never-ending generosity of his sister Aiko, and dodges the wrath of his 
impatient brother-in-law Tak. He thinks that if only he could get married 
all his problems would be solved...
