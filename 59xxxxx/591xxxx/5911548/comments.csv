every tracker works except for the 4 non-working trackers that piratebay 
adds to the torrent which includes the 2 openbittorent trackers. The 
""udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce"" works sometimes so i leave 
that one but delete the other 3. I've watched the tracker list from 
time to time, and have been removing non working trackers, but the 
worst ones i just noticed were that these 2: 

""http:// bt1.the9.com:6969/announce"" 
""http:// bt6.the9.com:6969/announce""

The reason why i mention this is because these are 2 working trackers that 
give wrong seed and peer numbers, like the Heart - Magic Man video i just 
posted, which still included one of the trackers, was telling me there was 
38 seeds, when there was only 18, so it also will not be included anymore 
so seeds are not lost because the numbers are falsely inflated."
