,davesting2001,2010-10-28T05:00Z,"then explain to me how I have a 10/10 copy of red, and a few others still in theaters"
,mandukar,2010-10-28T14:31Z,"Because u do sometimes get decent ones, they probably are DVDscreeners which are leaked version's of the DVD. "
,davesting2001,2010-10-29T05:29Z,right so you cant say that you cant get them if they are not on dvd
