A lot of things going on in this episode, and A, B, C and D storyline to keep track of, and all handled seamlessly. Two character arcs (Eli/hismother and Sharon/Wray) merged and resolved in one, plus three ongoing grander plots being expanded featuring Chloe and what happened to her, Rush and the bridge, and Simeon and the rest of the Lucian Alliance forces. The musical montage at the end was particularly classy, featuring music from Ludovico Einaudi. There were particular stand out performances from Glynis Davies (Maryann Wallace, Eli's mother) who had some emotional scene with Eli (David Blue) and Robert Knepper, who plays Simeon. This episode seems to have signalled the start of his arc, as he realises something disturbing about the rest of the Lucian Alliance forces. All in all a great episode, with the characteristic high quality we have come to expect from Stargate Universe!
