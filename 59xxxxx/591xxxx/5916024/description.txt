Ok people using Vista and 7 seemed to have a problem with Saving/Loading. Well here is the Crackfix i recieved from THETA. Everything should be working now!Tested it on my own laptop which uses windows 7 64bit. Everything about the save/load problems were fixed all thanks to THETA! yaaaaay!!! 

Also people who are having the d3d9.dll error, Download the DLL it asks for and put it in your system32 directory.

Credit goes to THETA.
