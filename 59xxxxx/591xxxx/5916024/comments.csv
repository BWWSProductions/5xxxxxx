,notdone23,2010-10-28T06:25Z,It worked. It had me reinstall the game again. Wouldn't Overwrite the previous install. So had to install in different Directory. Just played a little but the save function works with this fix. 
,notdone23,2010-10-28T06:46Z,Well spoke to soon the saved game loads into a black screen.
