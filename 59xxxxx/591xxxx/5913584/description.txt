          Michael McDonald and his band combine yuletide favorites 
          such as White Christmas and Steve Wonder's Motown classic 
          That's What Christmas Means To Me with a selection of his 
          signature hits including Sweet Freedom, I Keep Forgettin',
          It Keeps You Runnin', and Takin' It To The Streets for a 
          perfect blend of holiday cheer. Other songs such as Peace 
          and Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, see Michael 
          accompanied by a string orchestra, adding an entirely new 
          dynamic to the diverse set. 
          McDonald's soulful, throaty baritone infuses these popular 
          seasonal songs with a unique vocal styling that adds the
          perfect accompaniment to everyone's holiday season!
