,smile_census,2010-10-26T15:08Z,Do you still have the DVD of Lost Season 5 with eng sub? I haven't seen this season yet. Thanks very much
,darth-malachi,2010-10-26T21:30Z,Check my upload list by licking on my nickname: It appears Season 5 set even got some seeders left.
,smile_census,2010-10-27T17:48Z,Thanks very much first. Actually I've downloaded them before but it seems that the DVDs hang at the main menu (Language Selection). What should I do?
,t-h,2010-10-28T00:45Z,Any chance of sharing the DVD with the Epilogue on it in original quality?
,osse9,2010-10-28T16:21Z,"Hi!
First thanks for the uploads.
Are you uploading the rest of season 6?

Regards Osse"
,darth-malachi,2010-10-28T20:57Z,"to: osse9, t_h - Yes, eventually. Need to get more seeders for existing ones first.

to: smile_census - I now regret uploading the shrinked to DVD5 version of that set. It played flawlessly for me, but apparently caused many problems for people with different software or DVD drives. I'll look for original DVD9 set on the web, but don't get your hopes high: most hints lead back to re-distributed versions of my original upload."
,smile_census,2010-10-29T13:15Z,"Thanks very much. I shall be grateful if you can find them, but never mind if you cannot."
,IvortTheBoneless,2010-11-25T13:09Z,"THANK YOU buddy! Please seed until we got it 100% and I will seed it too, I did it with other seasons too. Just to ask, do you have DVD 4 and 7 of Season 3? Because the guy who uploaded them, doesn't seeding, he just uploaded the torrents! Strange people..."
