Center Of The Universe: Simulacra

Center of the Universe
Simulacra

A perfect replica of something that never existed
Â«SimulacraÂ» is the second part in The Center of the Universe's ongoing trilogy about time and space. The theme of the album is misplacement in space. If there were no space, everything would be at the same point, packed together like matter in a black hole. Extremely dense and with collected sounds from various instruments crashed together at high speeds, this is the album equivalent of a pitch black room with lightning as the only source of light. Noises and reverberations from non-euclidean structures are strictly systematised and condensed into a groove that shifts in dimension, from one particle to a galaxy in the blink of an eye. In this space-less space, the music tries to sound like the music of the real world, like a tree resembling a crooked man, a dragon seen in clouds, or a face seen on the surface of a stone.
