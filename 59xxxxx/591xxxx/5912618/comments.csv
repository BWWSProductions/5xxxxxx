,TheLibertyMachinima,2010-11-13T10:51Z,"First, you need to extract the files with Winrar, then, uhm, i don't know because i didn't downloaded it yet, but as soon as i download it, i'll let you know (unless someone else already told you)

But you probably have to put the .iso or .cso file into the PSP's memory stick or something..."
