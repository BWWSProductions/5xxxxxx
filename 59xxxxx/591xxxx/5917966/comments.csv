Working flawlessly fine on Kmeaw 3.55.

Thank you webchella, thank you so much."

,xaleeeeeel,2011-06-22T01:44Z,"this game sometimes freezes at some spots, is it me or everyone has experienced?"
,Fuqthegovt,2011-06-26T09:05Z,"for the noobs this game has a file >4gb so you have to split it first with comgenie awesome filemanager, put it on usb, then move it to internal with multiman. After that works fine with kmeaw 3.55/multiman 2."
,echonight78,2011-10-07T20:18Z,i think this should be subfoldered in BLES00928.by using param edit find that file is called BLES00928
,echonight78,2011-10-08T02:06Z,"put the game in folder called BLES00928
ps when extract the game and send it by ftp to your ps3 rename it to a shorter name to avoid problems and it will work fine"
