,l3ohyp3rion,2010-11-01T14:26Z,"brilliant concept, awesome sound quality, just not very well executed. The timings for pretty much all the tunes are off....you've done the hard part - getting the raw intrumentals and extracting the raps from their original beats. 

I would have thought the easiest part was putting them together... 'No Apologies/FRGT10' and 'Pretty Waiting/Lying From You' are very good tracks, only criticism being the off timing again. The rest of the album is aweful and not worth hearing."
