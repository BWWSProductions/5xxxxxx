In June 2007, a sex tape of Noelia and former boyfriend Yamil started circulating on the Internet, which caused a media hype around her person. In August 2007, Noelia accused her stepfather and former manager, Topy Mamery, of sexually assaulting her back in 2003; she claimed to have filed a lawsuit, calling singer Ricardo Montaner as a witness. However, Mamery denied having received any lawsuit, and Montaner denied ever having been called to testify. During an interview with Primer Impacto, Montaner was asked about this and he said, "I have never seen anything weird (between Noelia and Mamery). Mamery is a gentleman that has loved Noelia as her daughter."
