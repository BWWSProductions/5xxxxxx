PLOT:

Clay,(McCarthy) an eighteen-year-old freshman, comes back from his first term at a college in New Hampshire to spend his Christmas vacation with his broken-up wealthy family in Los Angeles. His former girlfriend, Blair,(Gertz) is now involved with his ex-best-friend, Julian (Downey Jr.). She warns Clay that Julian needs help: he is using a lot of cocaine and has huge debts. What follows is a look at the youth culture of wealthy post adolescents in Beverly Hills with a strong anti-drug message.

TAGLINE:

It only looks like the good life. In Beverly Hills, you can have anything your heart desires. You just can't have it the way it used to be.
