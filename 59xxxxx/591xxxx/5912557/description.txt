Sweet (originally The Sweet) was a British rock band that formed in the late 1960s and rose to prominence as one of the main glam rock acts in the 1970s, with the classic line-up consisting of Brian Connolly, Steve Priest, Andy Scott, and Mick Tucker.
During the early years of 1971 and 1972, Sweet's musical style followed a marked progression from the Archies-like bubblegum style of the first hit, "Funny Funny", to a Who influenced heavy rock style supplemented by a striking use of high-pitched backing vocals. The band achieved notable success in the UK charts, with thirteen Top 20 hits during the 1970s alone, with "Block Buster" (1973) topping the chart, followed by three consecutive number two hits in "Hell Raiser" (1973), "The Ballroom Blitz" (1973) and "Teenage Rampage" (1974). Their first self-written and produced single "Fox on the Run" (1975) also reached number two on the UK charts.
Sweet membership has undergone a number of changes, and during different periods Scott, Connolly and Priest also each formed their own "Sweet", resulting in the separate bands Steve Priest's Sweet, Andy Scott's Sweet and Brian Connolly's New Sweet.
Connolly died in 1997, and Tucker in 2002.
Two of the bands are still in existence: the U.S. version of The Sweet, founded by original bass player Steve Priest, and the U.K. version of The Sweet, featuring Andy Scott.

...even though health and wealth
hadn't yet missed me
none of them not even jenny 
once kissed me 
those very same girls
who with me have grown older
now freely relax with their heads
on my shoulder
and now come the kisses
a flood in full spate
the meaningless kisses
too many too late...

...tell me oh dear friend
for fain would i know
where were these kisses
three decades ago
