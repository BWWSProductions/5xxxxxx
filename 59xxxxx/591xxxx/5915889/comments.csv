,_Dux,2010-10-28T12:47Z,"Hey mate, I don't have any requests, just a suggestion :)

I really think you should make 700 MB files - I've downloaded Animal Factory (2000) recently - 700 MB, 720x384, 25 FPS, MP4.
The quality is insane, even on my 23,6"" monitor!

Please take a look for yourself if you're not too busy! Maybe you could make similar rips?
Again, this is no spam or a complaint, just trying to contribute to your great work :)"
