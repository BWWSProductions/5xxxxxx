App Runner 0.4.9 for Debian, Ubuntu and any GNOME-based system


Features:
*No need to mark the file as "executable" before running it
*Run any executable/script that the host OS supports: ELF, BASH, Python, Perl... (.bin .sh .run .py, etc...)
*Can run any program as a normal user, or as the root user
*Works both with GUI (graphical) programs and CLI (command line) programs
*Automatically expires the root session (on systems with sudo) before running any program (to increase security)
*Automatically removes the "executable flag" after running the file (if App Runner added it)
