Biography by Jason Ankeny & Bradley Torreano allmusic.com

Eminem emerged as one of the most controversial rappers to ever grace the genre. Using his biting wit and incredible skills to vent on everything from his unhappy childhood to his contempt for the mainstream media, his success became the biggest crossover success the genre had seen in years. Being the first Caucasian rapper to make a significant impact in years may have given him a platform not afforded to 
equally talented African-American rappers. A gifted producer as well, his talents always seemed overshadowed by his media presence, which was a mix between misunderstood genius and misogynistic homophobe. Both may be true, but his message spoke to legions of disaffected youth.
