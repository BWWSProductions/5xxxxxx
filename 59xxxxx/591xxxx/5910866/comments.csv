IÂ´d like to ask too because i am not totally happy with the number of seeds and if it is possible  keeping helping more as possible if possible because the flux of new peers is increasing and i think everyone is more happy at the moment of the download if more help to get the file is available .
My requests are not to avaliate wrong anything or anyone or make repreendations , just with the intention that the normal stability of the file with the normal increase of the users still stable and with that better for everyone  and please reading the description in case of possible doubts is not that bad . Thank you everyone for understanding my innofensive suggestions and happy gaming to all of you ."

,noxcovenant,2010-10-27T01:11Z,"Eurgh, as always, the comments section is confusing as f*ck.

Here's all you need to know (YOU DON'T NEED TO DOWNLOAD ANYTHING EXTRA!):
====================

1) Download FreeARC (http://www.freearc.org/Download.aspx)

2) Extract into any folder.

3) TO CHANGE TO ENGLISH:  Go into main folder and double-click ""reg 32 bits.reg"" for Windows 32-bit users or ""reg 64 bits.reg"" for Windows 64-bit users.

4) Goto subfolder ""LevelPacks"" and double-click ""Globe Converter.exe"".  The game will unpack several files.  It only takes a few minutes.

5) FINALLY, go back to main folder and double-click on ""SWTFU2.exe"" and the game will start.

DOES THIS RIP INCLUDE ALL THE VIDEOS?
============================

Sadly, this rip does not allow you to view the FMVs (globeplus did not rip the videos correctly).  But you can HEAR the audio of the FMVs in full English.  So if that's enough for you, then this rip is made for you.

Other than that, every thing else is in English (the stormtroopers and your main char all talk in English).  So globeplus did a great job in that category.

If you can't live without proper FMVs, wait for someone else to dump this game."
,Shoobox,2010-10-27T01:41Z,"@noxcovenant
first use Peazip not freearc,
freearc sucks azz, Peazip is faster and will open globes arc files on machines for people who only have 2gb of ram without taken an hour to extract.
second

my link to fix your pref. of language of the game made by rainer is pretty straight forward

this language fix is for mulit 7 games and should work, i didnt have any issues
as some people do not want english, but the game should already be in english once extracted!

Once again you lash out at people for your mistakes,
most people are having issues with your files,
stop taking it so personaly,
your continuously lash out not everyone can be wrong, apparently your videos are not working wright as they dont in most of your ripps.
so once again i ask you the full game file size is only a little over 5.96gb so why not compress them right?
i find it amusing that you only test your ripped games on a 64 bit OS system, most people only have 32bit OS systems, and there are only a couple of handful of actuall 64 bit games, so why are you complaining about people complaining with your rips if you rely on them with 32bit OS to test the game to see if it works,
You yourself have stated ""you have no way of testing on 32bit OS"" so i failed to see you reason of argument,!!!!"

The full .iso will now install.

Also, as a side note, this RIP didn't function correctly on a 64-bit system either.  Maybe the FMVs only work if you set the language to german?"

but as far a force unleashed
 u might be better off getting the 5.96gb version that reloaded offers, its not that much bigger of a file and it ran smooth, from crack, 
 globes version of force unleashed 2 doesn't even have proper videos and the videos are essential in this game for story, unless your not worried about story."

For ATI video card users, go to the Catalyst Control Center and enable Application Control Settings for SMOOTHVISION: Anti-Aliasing and SMOOTHVISION: Anisotropic Filtering.

,aayush456,2010-11-05T13:13Z,"ok here's the deal
the videos are not in english ( german probably )
they don't work ingame i.e u can listen to the audio with a black screen ..subs IN ENGLISH do the trick.
the videos do work in vlc player; so u can watch them by running the game in windowed mode and running vlc simultaneously and try to make out what they say using subs

anyways gr8 wrk globe.
ur rips rock"

First of all thanks for the upload, i downloaded many of your uploads and they all worked like a charm, this one included.

But this upload has few videos not included, the ones that are included are the worst quality i have ever seen and they are also in german.

So for the people that are a fan of star wars i would recommend to take the reloaded one, if you just want to play this game without story, this one is superb.

Again, thanks for all your wonderfull uploads much appreciated

Cheers,
