 Players will once again control Starkiller, Darth Vader's secret apprentice and the protagonist in the first game, who may be a clone. Starkiller escapes from captivity on Kamino. After eliminating his stormtrooper captors, Starkiller embarks on a quest to understand his identity and to find his love interest from the first game, Juno Eclipse. Meanwhile, Darth Vader has hired Boba Fett to track down Juno Eclipse to lure Starkiller out of hiding.
