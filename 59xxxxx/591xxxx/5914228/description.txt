A horrifying crime enrages Fitch, Washington, Stone and Sanchez when a young woman is shot multiple times in her SUV while hiding a safe, but terrified two-year-old in the back. The long and winding road of discovery runs from the woman's ex-husband to an under-the-radar, possibly illegal manipulation of the foster care system. Meanwhile, Longford and Mahajan investigate the homicide of a college janitor found with drugs in his system. It looks to be the "perfect murder," until the detectives crack the case with an unusual motive.
