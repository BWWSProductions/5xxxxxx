"Xerces"

After renowned weapons dealer, Xerxes, hides 
the formula to a dangerous and lethal 
biological weapon in a painting, Shaw 
(Gerald McRaney) assigns Steven (Boris 
Kodjoe) and Samantha (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) the 
task of traveling to Tuscany to secure the 
painting and capture Xerxes. When the 
assignment requires Samantha to assume a 
previous cover and partner with Steven's 
enemy, Clive (guest star Sean Maguire, "Meet 
the Spartans"), the Blooms learn that 
teaming together is not as easy as they 
thought. Meanwhile, Hoyt's (Ben Schwartz) 
attraction to Clive's assistant proves to be 
instrumental in finding the culprit.

Enjoy :)
