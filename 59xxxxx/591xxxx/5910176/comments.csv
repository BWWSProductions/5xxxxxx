,Equinox117,2010-10-25T19:59Z,thanks for the UL.... 1 main question every1 will ask is does this support convert from mkv to avi with multi sub stream.... can u just take the eng subs n hardcode them with the conversion?
,Equinox117,2010-10-25T20:11Z,"If you are thinking of converting anime.... it cant convert subs if you have multi-stream audio.... so you have to put up with it in english... if ur like me... i prefer jap audio, eng subs....."

,billya181,2011-06-29T12:43Z,well i tried nearly all the other ones available here for MKV to AVI conversion and not is this one the only one that worked for me but was the best anyway.
,illusionxox,2011-07-13T21:42Z,"i bet this shit cant convert , more then one mkv files at a time and keep the subs on it . if it converts at all. ill be back "
,illusionxox,2011-07-13T21:49Z,"yep i was right converts with no fucking subs, i hate mkv so fucking much id punsh the fuck outta the ppl that made them and kick them in the balls 5 times a day for a week, the only converter that convert with subs in winavi converters and thats just one at a time.

,lionbums,2012-01-06T06:25Z,Converts WAY too slow. Converts a 1 hour movie in 7 hours. Anybody have a very FAST converter? Thanks
