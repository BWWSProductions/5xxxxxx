[T],KickAssTorrents,2010-10-27T13:18Z,I need to ask this why are the end credits removed it doesnt make sense to me certainly not on a 720p BRRip
[V],prashant22,2010-10-27T13:21Z,"DSIN
Then I'll hv to watch this one.."
,smasudi,2010-10-27T13:30Z,whats next?
[V],prashant22,2010-10-27T14:04Z,"@kickass
Because removing end credits can save 20-30mb of size..so the end result will be 590mb instead of 620mb like in this case..

@smasudi
Next is transformers
Then pan's L...."

Hey buddy, thanks for accepting. I was going to request it to u last time i visited your upload, but there were already a lot of requests by other fellows. So i was sure u will not accept it. But you did. Buddy, you made my day. Thanks a lot.  "

One more thing. I know its weird but  pleeeeeeeaaaaase keep the credits intact. I dont know what reason to give you on this, it feels something missing or wrong. Hope you understand. Its strong request and a nice habit. Give it a thought. But its all up to you. 
Lots of thanks for the great quality uploads."

,himansu_007,2010-10-29T10:41Z,+1 In Quality
,fr3ak82,2010-11-08T17:10Z,@mzk57 Boring......shit man .....go watch sme romatic/comedy movie...moron..this movie is kickass
,romet6,2011-09-06T12:33Z,"Thanks for the effort, the quality is great and it's an awesome movie.

However, when people download 720p quality movie files, they shouldn't usually mind the extra 30 MBs and you should have kept the end credits.

Also, I don't believe this is the original version of the movie. The one that I have seen before ended with Macha killing himself, rather than the chess scene and some blokes talking about the real enemy.

I feel that that ending is really important and it really hurts the story when the ending is changed. They got the homicidal maniac to kill himself rather than killing Jake by messing with his head, that's the story. Destroying your evil enemy without committing murder so you'd never have to look over your shoulder again."
,lanto777,2011-09-09T09:36Z,Actually i read the the maker of this movie intended for there to be no credits at the end of the movie.

,lanto777,2011-09-09T10:12Z,also think this is the 2007 us version where they cut out the good ending. the 2005 uk version is the best because thats how it was intended to be veiwed.
