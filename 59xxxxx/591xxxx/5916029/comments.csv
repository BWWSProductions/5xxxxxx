If it's so hard for you to say a thanks then better stop posting more non sense, like you did in this torrent:

Thanks uploader."
,TheoB56,2011-05-09T18:10Z,"Thank you very much for the upload. The Bonus-discs are great.

Girmi007 isn't that stupid. Disc 2 - Movie 2nd part is cropped. Just look at te split-screen scene of Jefferson Airplane at the beginning.
It's not a big deal, but I thought I should mention it. "
,Enigmatrix,2011-05-20T16:59Z,"Thank you soooo, very much. I have never seen this."
,mrblandy,2011-05-20T20:27Z,"Great torrent! Saw this one night on IFC, I think, but I only caught the second half. One of the most amazing documentaries I've seen, and I hadn't seen the bonus content either.

Thanks a mil"
,SteadyH3,2011-05-23T10:43Z,"What's wrong with these mkv files?  Ever since I downloaded them weeks ago, whenever I view them inside their folder explorer.exe crashes.  Does anyone else experience this?"
,SteadyH3,2011-05-23T11:07Z,Ok..this is going to sound really bad so close to girmi...but faulty codec...reinstalled klite XD
