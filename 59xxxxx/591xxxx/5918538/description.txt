The upcoming movie Tron Legacy (2011) 
is now beeing rumored to come with a one of a kind soundtrack,
Made by Daft Punk duo Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo.

According to some people the songs featured in this torrent are for 75% real.
First Six songs are FX music, such as intros and outros from the movie.
+ A underground live performance recorded in France of there new upcoming single 
Derezzed that will be released begin 2011.

Almost all Leaks from Virgin, Disney, and some real or fake of the internet... 

What's the link between Tron and Daft Punk? The answer: a lot. At this moment, 
our beloved French duo is working on the movie soundtrack for Tron, 
which will be released by Disney in 2010. Electromaze thinks it'll be a great movie
just because Daft will fill the theaters with new, stereo-bangin' stuff. 
At the Comic Con event, the movie was presented to the press
