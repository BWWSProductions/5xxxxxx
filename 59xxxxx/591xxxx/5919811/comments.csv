in a size of 4gigs?"
,reipan,2010-11-06T20:28Z,Beware of this and the 720p release from cinefile. especially if you save it to your main drive. i was unable to rename it. i was also not able to move or delete it. no virus or malware were detected. I had to empty the drives it was on and then format the drive with this and the 720p version to be rid if it. wait for a differant release.

,laazara,2011-09-23T09:50Z,"@reipan
You were unable to rename because the file was busy and locked by your Operating System.
See the file is huge so the system was trying to get its properties(Metadata). Hence it was locked."
,ciprianionut,2011-12-20T11:45Z,It's ok i rename it move it...Good quality good sound is 1920x872 resolution.
,Tourniquest,2012-02-17T21:34Z,"Regarding reipan's problems: this happens on files saved with header compression in mkvmerge. If you have the divx tech preview installed to get thumbnail images on mkv files it will hang explorer (make it really slow and eat up the memory). You can fix the file by resaving it in mkvmerge without header compression. Disable it by default in the options. Then restart the computer and delete the original file in ""dos"" via start->cmd. Or just uninstall the divx tech preview, I guess."
