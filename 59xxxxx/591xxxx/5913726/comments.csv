,scottsasse,2010-11-18T02:16Z,I'm currently showing a total of 36(184) seeds and 1(125) peers. Let me be the FIRST and ONLY one to say THANK YOU in the 22 days since you uploaded this torrent!!!! Would it kill you people to show a little gratitude every now and then?? No wonder the world is falling apart. Sometimes I'm ashamed to be part of the human race. Also THANKS to you 36 active seeders!!

You provide so much shit I cancelled my dvr and cable service, every show I watch you provide. Even though I don't comment on every torrent ( I always forget my username and password) which I should, I want to thankyou for all the work you put in to provide this. All your video and audio quality are legit, and you give the option to download better quality files or ones that take up less space, thanks."
