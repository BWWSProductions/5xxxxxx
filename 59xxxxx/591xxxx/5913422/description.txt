                    The Short Straw.                         
                    Medical drama series. Michael basks in the  
                    luxury of Holby Care, leaving Penny in the  
                    lurch on the frontline on AAU. But with Hanssen  
                    arriving on AAU just in time to witness the  
                    mess, Michael realises he may have pushed his  
                    luck. Will Michael step up to be Penny's knight  
                    in shining armour? Connie is shocked to hear  
                    that Ric could be made redundant and wants to  
                    try and protect him from Hanssen. She struggles  
                    to fight the system and realises the financial  
                    realities the hospital is facing. With the odds  
                    stacked against her, will Connie find another  
                    solution to save Ric and beat Hanssen at his  
                    own game? Elizabeth is sure she'll be on the  
                    redundancy list - last in, first out. More  
                    nervous than ever in Hanssen's presence,  
                    Elizabeth is worried about making a mistake.  
                    With Ric's help, Elizabeth hopes to swing  
                    things her way, but will it be enough to secure  
                    Hanssen's good opinion and secure her job?
