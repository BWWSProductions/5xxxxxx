,NillerBean429,2010-11-05T18:12Z,Been a while since I had to unrar like this torrent has you. Do I just unrar all of the archives and then mount the un-numbered archive?
,BeAware2011,2010-11-06T13:20Z,Works just fine! Thanks for the game dude! Nice torrent!
,buschmanmax,2010-11-08T14:44Z,"you actually have to ""unrar"" twice (the first is not really an unrar its just combining the broken segments of the files the second time u do it with the combined file then you're actually decompressing the file) then after the second time running it thru winrar (or equivalent) u mount THAT image."
,buschmanmax,2010-11-08T14:46Z,oh and ty to the uploader im DLing now will report back when done on quality etc.

@mrboring,
I hav'nt downloaded it yet and i can tell you it's the rld-tfu2.sfv (1.44 KiB) just by looking at the contents of the torrent, hope that helps. "
,Obie314,2010-11-23T19:33Z,"i thought i knew what i was doing, but i guess the simplified install instructions were too much for me. where is this cracked content and where do i copy it over to? please help"
,Reevs646,2010-11-24T03:01Z,I am very confused with all of the rar files. I am trying to unrar them and it is telling me they are corrupt. So i rebuild them and it tells me stuff are missing. Can anyone explain step by step what to do to unrar these please?
,murrambingi,2010-11-24T04:04Z,"You copy the SWTFU2 in the crack folder then  by going to Start then Computer then Local Disk then Program Files then LucasArts then Star Wars The Force Unleashed 2 you then paste the crack and when it asks you to copy and replace you choose yes.
