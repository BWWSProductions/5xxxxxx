 
Very truly impressive picture quality - the best we've seen for this movie
anywhere, - (converted from our equally impressive DivX HD version - a nice
2GB offering instead, if you do have an HD capable disc player. If you dont,
this 1GB version is the best there is for your standard 
DivX capable disc player)

The remains of the day is a most compelling film about the loss of core
values that have any real meaning.

Indeed the capacity to articulate well is fundamentally intrinsic to what is
a sane and civilized existence for those that are capable of attaining it, certainly.

That said, there can be no substitute for the ability to give genuine care and warmth
as is appropriate to those that are in our community (in fair spirit I would think).
It is otherwise a meaningless existence we pursue, despite what flashes of apparent 
brilliance are offered as an example along the way.

2Hrs 12minute program - subtitles on the net, please choose the best available
subtitles for your language of choice!
