Release Notes:Video:Italian TS

Audio:Own/Italian TS

This cam was a little better then other versions out there cleaned it up quite a bit as well

Audio:Audio is real decent and after we got our audio we realized that the current cam version are missing about 5 minutes from the video not from the ending

But about 2 minutes in so i left the original italian audio and hardcoded subs for that 3 minutes or so and ending did not have any verbage so i left that audio alone all in all

it's watchable take it or bitch away
