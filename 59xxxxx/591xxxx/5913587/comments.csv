,xlomoprosopo,2011-02-24T23:40Z,"Thanks for the torrent, but I have a little issue and I think probably it faults that I have Greek version. Many orders when I play are disappeared. I want to give an order to my Sim and appears only the half of them.Also the same problem in ""create a Sim"", I don't see all the preferences of the character to choose. Finally at the town, when I put a lot, I can't change it from residential to commercial or anything else.The selection is invisible and I choose in luck. All these invisible orders are the ""late night"". Please help!!!"
