[V],WildcardSearch,2012-01-14T00:48Z,Great upload BONE. Thanks a lot.
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2012-01-26T21:22Z,"Can't be A/V=10/10 because  the size is wayyyy too small for the movie length [almost 3 hours]

So: the size, the resolution, the video bit rate all are wrongly chosen. The result can't be OK !!

A/V=7/7 

It should be done better for such a movie quality !!

For those who care about quality this is not the right torrent. [Fast? Yes.]

TRY ANOTHER avi+mp3 with the PROPER settings and quality output !!"
,H4x14N,2012-02-08T02:07Z,"@CODYBOSS1969- this was uploaded 0ct. 27, 2010. This is an older movie.  DvD's were expensive in 2010 still.  Most people used cd's and either broke the movie in 1/2 or lowered the res/quality(for longer movies so it would fit on one cd).  that resolution seemed more like a personal one(or he messed up?).  Either way, it's free, and you either get it or you don't... nuff said"
