,eclecticjohn,2011-09-04T21:43Z,You do good work. I downloaded all of your wire uploads and they were all great. You have good taste too. Especially since you refused the person who asked for Glee :p

,thegoose420,2011-11-16T20:35Z,anyone know how to convert to .avi so they can be streamed on a PS3?  I can't find a single torrent in .avi format and would really prefer to watch on the big screen as opposed to a laptop.
,anderooB33,2012-05-10T16:38Z,"after having my social circles tell me too watch ""Twin Peaks"" for aeons, i finally succumb to the pressure and look to torrent it on a dark stormy night.
122 seeders,1.41GB, fully downloaded in 20 minutes
A=10
V=10

Cheers buddy
