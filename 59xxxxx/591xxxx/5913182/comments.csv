,masterfaster2,2010-10-26T21:40Z,"thanks

[T],Coolguy33,2010-10-26T22:37Z,"@lukegoodman2001, the file is larger so i'm thinking it should all run fine but we won't know for sure until we get more feedback!"
,masterfaster2,2010-10-26T23:15Z,"maybe it's the multi5

I know that there will be 3 releases:

Multi2 (RUS/EN) by 1C (the TRiViUM full DVD release or the CloneDVD P2P release by Epidemz.Net)

Multi2 (PL/EN) (I assume that scene group PROPHET will release this in the future)

Multi5 (It is probably the RELOADED release)


I don't know if there will be a different version of the game.


This is not nuked yet, so I suppose it is working."
