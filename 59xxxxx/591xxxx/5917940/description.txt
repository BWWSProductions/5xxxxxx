The Ball is a first person action-adventure game featuring a full single-player 
experience built on Epicâ€™s Unrealâ„¢ Engine 3 technology. As a swashbuckling 
archaeologist working on the slopes of a dormant volcano somewhere in Mexico, you get stuck in a cavern. 
It doesnâ€™t take long before you realize this is more than just a cave. You reveal ancient 
ruins that have been hidden from outsiders for centuries and discover a mysterious artifact, 
a gold and metal shelled Ball. As you progress towards solving the mystery of this amazing place 
you must unlock the secrets of the Ball and learn to control this ancient artifact. 
Venturing deeper into the volcano, you reveal some of mankindâ€™s greatest secrets and you
