,TSHTT,2010-10-28T00:25Z,"A?
V?"
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2010-10-28T00:41Z,"Hmm, why only 700 megs for a film 2 hours long?  At least 1/4th the size of a single layer DVD would have been much better."
,rae30,2010-10-28T01:29Z,Is this worth downloading?
,er3wi1,2010-10-28T02:00Z,This Guys Are Stupid Waist my time
,greensbottom,2010-10-28T02:47Z,"whats the deal with this very slow, is this real or what

,greensbottom,2010-10-28T02:57Z,is this the same as tvteams torrent
,mcrackin,2010-10-28T03:20Z,There must be one person that has tested this out.... is this a good version or what???
,mcrackin,2010-10-28T03:25Z,i think this is fake
,deocide,2010-10-28T03:52Z,Just checked sample and A/V are fine.  Significantly better than the cam I sat through.
,mcrackin,2010-10-28T04:01Z,"yeah i take it back. finished downloading, its a good copy."

V:7
A:9"
,ando70,2010-10-28T09:56Z,"Thz AiTB, A/9 V/9     ps: top flick"
,arron255,2010-10-28T10:13Z,"Thanks AiTB for the time n effort to put up this torrent, I will seed for a week.

Ok true A-V scores and not over rated 9's lol

V- 5 very dark in places and has a watermark that pops up all the time, more of a good cam than a screener, best off waiting for a better copy

A- 7 very echoey and sounds distant, kinda like a cam audio, but you can make out whats going on.

M- 2"
,weezl3,2010-10-28T13:31Z,"Pretty good quality , ANYONE ENGLISH OR DUTCH SUBS?"

,michaelrwatson,2010-11-04T02:53Z,"@Eddiehjjjfcfjfc:

Ah, because 700MB is the limit to burn to CD. Apparently you weren't aware of that. Nor will a 1GB file (your arbitrary suggested size) be noticeably better quality than 700MB anyway.  In fact, for a 2hr movie, you can go a lot smaller than 700MB and still have great quality. Welcome to the 21st century."
,nikodo,2010-11-06T16:28Z,"michaelrwatson: So you pretend to live in the 21st century, but still you burn your movies to CD's???? OML! :-D"
,hsvnow,2010-11-09T22:23Z,"Thanks so much. This is the fastest movie I've ever downloaded from TPB, only took 5 minutes.

Quality is pretty good 7/10"
