Pure BS is the fourth studio album by American country music artist Blake Shelton, released in 2007 on Warner Bros. Records Nashville. It produced the singles "Don't Make Me" and "The More I Drink". The album was re-released in 2008 with three bonus tracks, one of which â€” a cover of Michael BublÃ©'s "Home" â€” was released as a single, becoming Shelton's fourth Number One country hit.

Unlike Shelton's first three albums, which were all produced by Bobby Braddock, Pure BS features three different producers: Braddock, as well as Brent Rowan and Paul Worley.

The album's first single was "Don't Make Me", which peaked at #12 on the Billboard country charts in 2007. Following this was the David Lee Murphy co-write "The More I Drink" which peaked at #19. Pure BS was re-released in May 2008 as Pure BS Deluxe Edition. This re-issue included his cover of Michael BublÃ©'s hit single "Home" and two additional tracks which Shelton wrote. The cover (which features backing vocals from Shelton's girlfriend, Miranda Lambert) was issued as a single in early 2008, and in July it became Shelton's fourth Number One single on the country charts.

"She Don't Love Me" was previously recorded by Trent Willmon on his self-titled debut album, and before that by Billy Ray Cyrus (as "She Don't Love Me (She Don't Hate Me)") on his 2003 album Time Flies. "I Don't Care" was later included on Shelton's 2008 album Startin' Fires.

Blake Tollison Shelton (born June 18, 1976, in Ada, Oklahoma) is an American country music artist. In 2001, he made his debut with the single "Austin". Released as the lead-off single from his self-titled debut album, "Austin" went on to spend five weeks at Number One on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. This song was the first single from his gold-certified debut album, which also produced two more Top 20 hits. Although the album was released on Giant Records Nashville, Shelton was transferred to Warner Bros. Records Nashville after Giant closed in late 2001.

His second and third albums, 2003's The Dreamer (his first for Warner Bros. proper) and 2004's Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill, were each certified gold as well. Shelton's fourth album, Pure BS, was issued in 2007, and re-issued in 2008 with a cover of Michael BublÃ©'s pop hit "Home" as one of the bonus tracks. This cover was also that album's third single. A fifth album, Startin' Fires, was released in November 2008.

Overall, Shelton has charted seventeen singles on the country charts, including seven Number One hits: "Austin" (2001), "The Baby" (2003), "Some Beach" (2004-2005), "Home" (2008), "She Wouldn't Be Gone" (2009), "Hillbilly Bone" (2010), a duet with Trace Adkins, and "All About Tonight" (2010). Additionally, three more of his singles have reached Top Ten: a cover version of Conway Twitty's "Goodbye Time", "Nobody but Me", and "I'll Just Hold On."
