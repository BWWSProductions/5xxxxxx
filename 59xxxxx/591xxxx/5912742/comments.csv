,JD74,2010-11-05T19:33Z,"Another one.....same as Love Actually.
The Audio is garbage. My Win7 MC HTPC is setup perfectly and plays every HighDef MKV, MP4, M2TS, AVI etc file I throw at it using pass-through audio for AAC, AC3 and DTS. All I get from this file is static.....and the only way to get audio is to use VLC, which will not pass-through...giving me stereo only. Rather than getting fancy with a new compression scheme, how about creating a more standardized file that works well, along side everyone else's. I have even tried Handbrake to re-encode the audio, with no success....... "
[T],fachman,2010-11-06T01:09Z,"All I can say JD74 is that your comp is NOT setup perfectly. It seems for me that you have correct configuration for DTS and AC3 but wrong in case of AAC. This is why VLC gives you only stereo.
First it would be good for you to start reading NFO. I know there is a lot of information, but they are provided to avoid such situation.
Second of all, the key to success is to decode AAC by computer and send to SPDIF uncommpressed PCM 5.1.
Good luck"

Awsome Video and audio. Thanks again.

@JD74... I have experienced alot of static from movies as well when i used to hook up my laptop to my LCD. The problem was that i had the volume on the player all the way up and thats where all the static was comming from. 
In my case i simply set the players volume to 50% and the volume on the computer to 50% then raise the volume on the TV accordingly. 
No they all play without static. Hope this helps.
