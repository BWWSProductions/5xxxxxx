Clinic, the cute Liverpudlians from Liverpool, are releasing their sixth album, Bubblegum, on October 4 in the UK (the US release date has yet to be confirmed). The album, according to the all-powerful press release, sees Clinic "throwing us a curveball": "In place of churning riffs and wired vocals is a dream state of harpsichords, dulcimers and strings. Melody and softness combine with the bandâ€™s unique internal logic to produce a record of pop beauty." In other words, Domino, the group's label, is trying to assure us that Bubblegum won't sound like every other Clinic album (that is, a slightly mutated Internal Wrangler) â€” terrific!

A new single, "I'm Aware," will be released in late September in anticipation for the new album, but mosey on over to the Chocolate Grinder to hear a "unique megamix" of Bubblegum. You'll even get to see the same press photo again!
