In case you're interested, I recommend a program called MP3Tag (it works for FLAC too).  It looks up ID3 tags, much like Winamp auto-tag, but it can also rename files based on those tags.  Once you figure out the interface, it's very useful.

By the way, please don't worry as this is seeding well. Neither TPB nor Demonoid correspond with my uTorrent in terms of the number of peers, probably a tracking issue."
