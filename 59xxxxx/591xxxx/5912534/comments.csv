,Ancient_Anomaly,2010-12-27T17:33Z,"Very low quality. I know it' just 650MB, but it's still far worse than it could be:
1. Severe pskip artifacts. Always use no-pskip for low bitrates.
2. Hindi track's stereo is out of phase. How the hell could that happen by accident? 
3. Banding. Did you convert to RGB or did you do some color correction? RGB is slower and lower quality, there is no reason why you should convert to RGB and back. Banding is mainly caused by conversion to 8bit RGB, not compression as commonly believed. Graphic cards use dithering to avoid this on 8bit RGB PC displays, but dithering is lost by compression."
