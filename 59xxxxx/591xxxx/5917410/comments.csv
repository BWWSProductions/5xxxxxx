,Oddie65,2011-06-04T00:01Z,"I really f*****g hate when people leech their asses off, then don't seed. People need to grow a pair! The ENTIRE POINT of a torrent is for faster downloads of larger files, by giving AND taking pieces of data to complete each download... AKA. SHARING!!!! This has been downloading for 2 hours, and its only a 160MB file. My DL speed is 22 mbs..... "
