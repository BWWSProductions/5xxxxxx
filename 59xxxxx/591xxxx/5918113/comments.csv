I would recommend to search youtube for some gameplay videos."
,masterfaster2,2010-10-29T00:19Z,Forgot to say: Thank you for the upload and thanks to THETA for the cracked game.
,superscooter143,2010-10-29T00:34Z,Is this only Spanish...?
,oharaandrewlp,2010-10-29T04:02Z,"Above all the spanish, it says English.  Why the uploader is giving a description in spanish for an english torrent is anyone's guess."
,Tippee,2010-10-29T07:50Z,If you try to uninstall this game and you have a anti-virus software it will detect a backdoor virus. No virus  my ass. If you don't believe me than try it but I advise you not to download this file.

,Psyc0Duck,2010-10-30T00:07Z,"@Tippee

wich anti virus software r u using?"
,Tippee,2010-10-30T20:32Z,Im using AVG 2011 Free edition.
,masterfaster2,2010-10-30T22:38Z,"This is a false positive, obviously.

Try the SKIDROW release, but I doubt that you will not get virus alert, now or in future definition updates.

Cracks are reported as viruses or trojans by Anti-viruses.  This is (obviously) also an anti-piracy measure.  So live with it or better buy the game."
