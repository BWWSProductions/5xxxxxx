Dadâ€™s Army is a British sitcom about the Home Guard in the Second World War and broadcast on BBC television between 1968 and 1977. 
The TV series ran for 80 episodes in total which 67 were adapted into the radio series.

The British Home Guard consisted of local volunteers otherwise ineligible for military service, usually owing to age.

In 2004, Dad's Army was voted into fourth place in a BBC poll to find Britain's Best Sitcom. 


The Walmington-On-Sea platoon of the Home Guard is commanded by pompous bank manager Captain Mainwaring. 
He's assisted by his chief clerk, Sergeant Wilson. 

Lance Corporal Jones is an old soldier, renowned for his frequent cries of "Don't Panic!" and "They don't like it up 'em!". 

Private Frazer is a miserable old Scotsman whose favourite saying is "We're doomed!". 

Private Godfrey spends much of his time asking if he can "be excused". 

Private Pike is a bit of a "mummy's boy". His mother is Sergeant Wilson's long-time girlfriend. 

Private Walker is a "spiv" - there are few things that he can't get his hands on, provided the price is right. 

This motley band of men provide Walmington-on-Sea's last line of defence against the Nazi hordes.
