You need to try a better scanner as that one seems to be broken.

NO MP3 has even contained a virus or Trojan.

My torrents are not Zip, Rar to hide anything.
(Never much point as MP3 (Etc) are already a compressed format.)

I have posted over 2 and a half thousand torrents. 

Of the five or so that think they know stuff and screamed ""Virus"" all were wrong. Welcome to their club.


Please go and read up on the subject before posting this false information as these silly remarks does not do the Torrent community any good.

Some will read your 100% wrong diagnosis and think you now what you're taking about.


NO MP3 has ""EVER"" contained a virus or Trojan, ""Ever"""

Slimoo is a trusted uploaded on here and works very hard to bring torrents to us.
Many thanks slimoo!"
