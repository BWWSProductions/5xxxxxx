Although many regard the The Cutter & The Clan as representing Runrig at the height of their powers, my own feeling is that this album steals that spot. This was their crossover album from Gaelic to mainstream. It retains the Gaelic feel of the earlier albums but has none of the commercial element that tended to dog _The Cutter and the Clan_and later albums. As a crossover album it has the feel of a debut album and as such retains the youth and energy that many debut albums have. There are several standout tracks, "Dance Called America", "Everlasting Gun", "This Darkest Winter" and the excellent "Skye".
