When his lightning bolt is stolen, Zeus accuses Poseidon's son Percy Jackson and gives fourteen days to Poseidon to return his lightning bolt; otherwise he would initiate a war against his brother. Meanwhile the dyslexic and with ADHD teenager Percy is visiting The Museum of Metropolitan of Art and is attacked by a Fury disguised in his teacher. His crippled best friend Grover reveals that Percy is a demigod and he is his protector and his teacher Mr. Brunner gives a pen to him telling that it is a powerful weapon. They go to Percy's house and together with his mother Sally, they drive to the Camp Half-Blood. However Sally is attacked by a Minotaur and vanishes before Percy can help her. In the camp, Percy befriends the gorgeous Annabeth; when they are attacked by Hades that wants the lighting bolt for him, Percy discovers that his mother is in hell with Hades.
