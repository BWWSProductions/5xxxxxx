    In the crypt of the remote castle of the Aguilars lies the               
    recently-deceased body of Maria. Her husband Antonio is a jealous        
    bully, his mute brother Ignazio is in a wheelchair peeping on his        
    caretaker Sol, a novice. Also present are Miria, the couple's            
    virginal daughter, and Isidro, a factotum who fears Satan's power. A     
    frequent visitor is Juan Suarez, a doctor who wants Miria in a           
    sanatorium for a month. She doesn't want to go. Isidro tries to          
    exorcize the castle's evil spirits. Bodies pile up. Is Miria's mother    
    truly dead, and who is Satan's tool?
