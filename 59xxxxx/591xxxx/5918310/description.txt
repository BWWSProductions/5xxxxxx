P.S. The game works ALMOST fine except when i play versus Jack Atlas at Free Duel - the console hangs-up as he draws his first card. On the other hand - when i try and skip those animated cutscenes showing character's actions everything goes fine. So it's up to you to download this one or not. I have neither time nor desire to test Story Mode, so it's quite possible you will face same problems there. You have been warned. Feel free to report your possible solutions. Peace.
