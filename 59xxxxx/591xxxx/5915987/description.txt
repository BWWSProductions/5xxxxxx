Lifestyle is designed to meet the everyday language requirements of people who need English for work, travel and socialising. As well as dealing with how people communicate at work, it also helps learners interact effectively outside of the work environment, enabling them to 'get things done' in a variety of situations.
Based on speech act research, conversational analysis and intercultural research, Lifestyle teaches useful 'people skills language'. This language will help students avoid misunderstanding and communication breakdown, enabling them to develop good work and social relationships in their everyday lives.
* Built on a solid syllabus of grammar, vocabulary, speaking and listening, the course is straightforward and easy-to-use with clear learning aims
* Regular Review units recycle language throughout the course
* Functional language is presented in a cross-cultural context helping learners to avoid communication breakdown......................
