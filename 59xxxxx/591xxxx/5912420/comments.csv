,Speal.,2010-10-28T23:05Z,"To people complaining about audio out of sync:
1. Download VLC media player--> http://vlc-media-player.en.softonic.com/download
2. Open the movie with VLC
3. to adjust your audio when you hear things before you see them press Ctrl L. You need to do this while playing so you can see how much you need to adjust it. It slows it at 50ms at a time.
4.To speed it up press Ctrl K which will increase at the same rate - 50ms a time.
5.Repeat keystrokes until it's in sync.

,iwgachi,2010-10-30T19:38Z,"Hi Guys, Don't worry about the audio sync. Open the movie with a VLC player and press Crtl + E to fix the sync.."
,Dr_Confusion,2010-10-31T05:06Z,"If you want a perfect sync, use VLC player

1. start the movie
2. press Ctrl+E
3. choose Sync Tab at the top
4. set Audio/Video to +1,800s

It worked well for me."

,robbieirish,2010-11-05T12:14Z,unfortunately there is little point in synchronizing as there is audio missing anyway. best waiting for a full audio to be attached and put into sync 
,Fuckingoutofsync,2010-11-22T23:38Z,"I made an account to comment on this shitty sync. I've tried this for 35 minutes and still it's fucked up.
