,mark123321,2010-10-26T10:10Z,"Hello 20/40,
you only upladd one episode of blue bloods.It has a slow beggining but i believe it will get better."
,mark123321,2010-10-26T10:11Z,Forgot to say thank you for all you are doing

@nikoHD: No for Mr. Row Bean, and I have uploaded very few good movies which have Mr. J. Chan in: Shanghai Noon, Shanghai Knights, Spy next door and recently Karate Kid. Only Gorgeous is postponed for future time. If you ask for trash mass-production from HK, answer is - no."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-26T12:47Z,"@mark123321: Inclusion of shows is simple enough - first upping of my encoding of Blue Bloods derived no interest, few downloads, even less seeders at least to next episode and no - thanks.
Rules are clear. Sorry."
