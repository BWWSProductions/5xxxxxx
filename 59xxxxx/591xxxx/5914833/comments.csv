,imjustwow,2010-10-27T20:16Z,"@ Mr.KickAss

Guess what...I am someone who does look for the skull but I can't fathom why u don't have one...but u shud know before leaving TPB that it does not matter if u have a skull or not...I have been following ur uploads so blindly that its just today that I noticed u don't have a skull...I guess it's already said u r one of best uploader...when I checked ur torrents...no doubt u were.....

So, forget the skull...u r a star in my book...I say u stay on...but will follow u anyways!!"

,ogchris,2010-10-28T06:55Z,"@kickass...

I don't blame you.  I just want to say thanks for all your fantastic uploads.  you rip the best quality/compressed files around.  Big Ups!  "
,i_am_sid,2010-10-28T18:09Z,"Very sad and heart breaking. Its like loosing a friend at you school where you daily visit(even on sunday).
Mr. Kickass we all respect you. You can see and feel that. It dosent require any certification from TPB. 
So no need to feel bad or sad. Just forget it. Be happy and cheerful. 
Following you on 1337x......."

,DarkMan70,2011-01-20T19:31Z,You can hear music on both but all voices are on Right channel :S
,phrend,2011-03-10T09:56Z,"Hey KickAssTorrents - thanks for all the ups!  I do have one question though - it seems like many of your uploads are labeled ""720p"" but the resolution is actually something less than 1280x720 - just wondering why that is?  Does it have something to do with the aspect ratio of the movie, like maybe your encoding is leaving off some letterbox black bars or something?

Thanks in advance!"
,maggyefs,2011-03-22T09:47Z,great quality! thanks!!!
,Vid89,2011-04-16T01:08Z,"Brilliant video quality, but crap audio. There is only one channel. It was ridiculous to upload it."
,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-06-28T21:41Z,"agree with the last comment. Audio sucks ass. It's mono not stereo. And just in case anyone is wondering, this is the director's cut - 3 hours."
,bravos2u,2011-07-30T23:10Z,"Thanks Kick-Ass 4 Sharing !!!

AND Thanks 4 including the subtitles !!!"
,kchri,2012-01-27T00:04Z,@fearandloathingandparanoia thanks so much for informing us. that was the answer to the only question i had
