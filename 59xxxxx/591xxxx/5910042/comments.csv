,dj-test,2010-10-26T13:18Z,"Does SP1 include all Hotfixes from original version (so if I install Windows 7 from original disc, it will also install all hotfixes?)."
,ucalien,2010-10-26T22:50Z,"So armesht, what are your impressions: The crashes/screen freezing of Win 7 got fixed with this service pack?? Any crash after installed?? What changing have you observed?? Are you using the 7 Ultimate??? You noticed real improvement??? Tnks by your attention! "
,ucalien,2010-10-27T18:27Z,"CRAP!!!!! This SP doesn't fix the damned freezing of Windows 7 and yet did reset the fucking integrated activation. Now I have a fucking ""windows 7 evaluation copy"" warning on my desktop, my administrator privileges got reset and I'll have to apply another activation crack."
,ucalien,2010-10-27T18:29Z,"And if I can't apply the activator, I'll have to format the fucking HD and install the Windows 7 build again. It sucks!"
,ucalien,2010-10-27T18:51Z,"DON'T INSTALL THIS!!! IT'S A TRAP!!!!! This service pack resets prior cracked activations and build versions of windows 7, removes administrator privileges and leaves no other option, except to format the drive. I've posted another alert and whoever uploaded this, REMOVED my comment. I'm warning again and I hope lots of leechers can read it!"
,ucalien,2010-10-27T18:53Z,Microsoft leaked this pack to fuck everybody that's installing pre-activated versions of Windows 7. 
[T],Computer-User,2010-10-27T21:37Z,Well... What's The Verdict On This Anyone? :) :P
,ucalien,2010-10-28T03:09Z,"Users of pre-activated and cracked versions of Windows 7 DON'T MUST INSTALL THIS SERVICE PACK. Nor this beta version, nor further alpha version. This file RESETS the administrative privileges and roll back the system to evaluation copy. And don't try to fix it applying the activator-crack again, 'cause it won't works. I installed this shit and I attempted to activate again with 3 different cracks and they didn't work. I had to format my HD and install my pre-activated Windows again. I hope someone crack this pack, otherwise I have to stick with a bugged Win 7 or go back to XP, that at least doesn't freeze."
,raygan777,2010-10-28T23:38Z,i have a crack version since it came out last year2009 its still working i use acronise true image always keep one disc of my window  activated  i have 4 hard disc  i tried it and found the version pirate  window 7 ultimate french i dont recommend it .  its up to u thank anyway
,raygan777,2010-10-28T23:42Z,i tried it and found out that was a pirate edition  window7 ultimate in french up to u to decide but i dont recommend it if u really  dont need it thank any way
,marko.rs,2010-10-30T10:37Z,I have updating my systems with this SP-windows6.1-KB976932-x86-INTL.exe and have no problem with it.Only curious thing is that orig size is 294 mb and not a 331 mb as this upload is.
,Deadly_NZ,2011-01-15T03:46Z,"Yes I too have installed this and it killed my Activation hack and when I ran the remove wat file again it said that it had already been removed only option to replace it.  No problem tho I Just made a SNAPSHOT (i'm not stupid) of system drive b4 playing, so was only a waste of about an hour and i'll keep the file for the new version of remove Wat to be written and try again.   To UCALIEN dont moan it's your fault if you didn't make an image of your system before installing untested software fromMiccysoft.  It's easy enough to do in Win 7   "
