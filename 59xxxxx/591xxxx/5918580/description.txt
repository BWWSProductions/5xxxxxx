is a 1982 hit song by the Dutch hard rock band Golden Earring. It was

from the book by Robert Ludlum The Bourne Identity, "Twilight Zone" appears 
on their 1982 album Cut. It reached #10 in the US Billboard Hot 100 and #1

This music video, directed by Dick Maas, features a storyline with lead 
singer Barry Hay as an espionage agent who is inevitably apprehended by 
three henchmen (played by the other members of the band). The music video 
was one of the first to feature a cinematic storyline and dance choreography

second international hit for the band. Golden Earring followed the success 
with an extensive tour of the USA, Canada and Europe.
