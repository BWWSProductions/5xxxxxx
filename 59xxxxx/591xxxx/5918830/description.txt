I(Jim Borwn) have been preaching and teaching Bible for over 50 years. In 1957, I began studying the scriptures diligently after graduating from high school. In 1980, God began dealing with me, bringing me to what I believed was my deathbed in 1985. In the hospital, I awoke near death crying out to God, "Lord...you are going to kill me if I don't quit living for myself and saying all the truth in my power." I began to say these blunt plain words that appeal to you elect sheep. As a result, I began to make more enemies than I could have ever imagined.

I was sick and tired of the â€œmushâ€ gospel that churches were preaching. My family was confused, and on many occasions on the way home from church, my wife would say, "he said such-and-such last week and he said this-and-that this week contradicting what he said the previous week." I began to say to my wife Mary, "Don't listen to the preacher, because he doesn't know what heâ€™s talking about." Finally, I said, "this is a waste of time! We are going home. We are not going to these churches any more. I will teach you from our home."

Twenty years ago, we started Grace and Truth Ministries which included my wife, son and one other young man. We started taping the sermons shortly thereafter. Grace and Truth Ministries is now meeting in a building located in Hendersonville, TN. Last year, we gave away approximately 25,000 DVDs free-of-charge. Regularly, we are adding more television, radio and internet to get the truth to the sheep who have ears to hear. If you are located in a city that does not air our programs, please contact us so that we can let you know how you may help to get this message out to God's predestined elect family.

Note:
Ok this is a whopping pack and I have a slow internet connection.  Please select the video you want or download one at a time, rather then try to get all at once.  Expect to get all, over a week or many weeks!

Question: If you download one at a time you will be able to watch as you go.  You ask, "how do I select one at a time?"

Answer: When adding the torrent to your torrent-client, most will display a selection of which files are to be downloaded.  You tick off the one you want or want now.  If you aren't asked then once the torrent is added, you will surely be able to select the files to not-download in the files list area of the torrent-client.  You tick on or select download or not to download, in the client as you go!
