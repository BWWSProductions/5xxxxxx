If you're going to boast at having a better cam version, please SEED THE FUKKIN THING before posting the link.

I can't even d-load the sample beyond 92.8%"
,Maxxax,2010-10-27T00:26Z,"is the audio actually hearable?

i saw this in the cinema today and its AMAZING, all the other torrents are missing the ending where Katie goes into the house kills them and takes the baby.

IS IT ENGLISH? thats the vital question"

,sickrthanothrs38,2010-10-27T03:39Z,"lmao sorry guess it takes a minute too show
thanks again for the upload :)"
,sickrthanothrs38,2010-10-27T05:56Z,just watched the movie...audio out of sync in the beginning for like 10 mins. audio fades in and out during the whole movie. good cam video tho. Overall the movie itself sucked!!!
,Abraxxos,2010-10-27T18:20Z,Wow this movie is completely unwatchable. I was so excited to watch this movie being a fan of the first one but the audio is way messed up. I have VLC and I've been advancing the audio forward and back but it never aligns right. Also like 10 minutes of no sound scattered throughout the movie. Been messing with it for over an hour and just deleted it. Don't waste your time with shit like this. Even for a CAM.
,Crunox,2010-10-27T19:25Z,"is it me or are there some parts missing?

V: 6
A: 5
M: 7"
,Puma__84,2010-10-27T21:36Z,this is good quality :) :)
,diemneiro_015,2010-10-28T16:05Z,"any DVDRIP??, "
,jezebel83,2010-10-29T00:04Z,a dvdrip!!!??? u aving a laugh!!!!! ITS STILL AT THE CINEMA!!!!!!
,Dinsqueeze,2010-10-30T00:40Z,downloads fast will comment on quality when finished
,AverageLewis,2010-10-30T14:30Z,"Downloaded this at 1.8MB/s in about 10 minutes, if that. Quality is decent, the sound could be better but it's a Cam so I won't complain. Thanks a lot. "
,Dilzy,2010-10-31T15:53Z,"Maxax, you're a complete arsehole and don't come out with I was tired when I wrote it shite. You've spolied this film on at least two uploads. Fucking prick"
,jagged5,2010-10-31T17:16Z,"For a cam - V:8/A:2

Video is really good for a cam. Audio is out of sync by a good second. Definitely ruins parts of the movie and it's very annoying in general."
,acenoise,2010-11-09T18:32Z,"Poor!
V=7, A=2 a real let down why is the audio so out of sync?, While one actor is speaking its showing the wrong actor so the girl is speaking in a mans voice for example, Its unwatchable imo! :("
,referhead,2010-11-09T19:34Z,"gotta love noobs, asking for dvd rips a few weeks after its released in theatres. dvd rips dont generally come out till a couple weeks before the actual DVD release... sometimes we get lucky and get R5 releases or screeners, which in most cases are extremly watchable. almost as good as dvd rips.. "
,woodchuck1992isLegit,2010-11-30T01:46Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS, the source for this torrent is being monitored and days after i downloaded this i got a nice Copyright Infringement letter from Comcast, I have downloaded 1000s of GBs worth of stuff from thepiratebay and this was the first time i ever got a letter from Comcast so be careful when downloading this movie"
