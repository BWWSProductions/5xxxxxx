,mcrackin,2010-10-28T03:29Z,"some more detail would help on the audio, not just ""its all screwed up in the beginning"".... is the movie watchable? is it screwed up for 30 seconds? or is the whole movie fucked? thanks for your stupid comment"

,Barryosterburg,2010-10-29T13:15Z,"Great copy.

Had some sync issues when I burnt to disc, but played fine on Windows Media Player.

Audio is good.

Don't listen to the philestines, this is very good show in the sedately paced European espionage vein...think low key Ronin.

Thanks for the U/L and the rest of you can bang it right up your clacka."

,firby321123,2010-10-30T12:24Z,movie is fucking BORING do not download
,gekkepop35,2010-10-30T16:58Z,"Hmm quality is good, but the movie was a waste of my time!
Do not download, the movie get's a 6 out of 10 on IMBD but for me it is not even 1 out of 10."
,proxxy,2010-10-31T06:42Z,"Ok, George Clooney must have done this purely for money (I think he produced this steaaming pile of crap).  Wow, talk about a movie with no beginning, no middle, and no ending.  I didn't think it was possible up until now.  I'll think twice before ever watching his movies again.  TOTAL waste of time, don't bother with this one."

,asheepie,2010-11-07T13:47Z,"The movie is only boring when you're used to watching shitty movies. And people don't usually do art pieces for money. It's a European slow-paced and atmospheric spy-thriller. Calling it boring simply displays the level of ""movie ignorance"" around these parts.

Thanks for the up."
,gooboy,2010-11-11T11:02Z,is it worth downloading?
,mby76,2010-11-21T15:22Z,"A/7 V/10

Don't listen to the haters.  This is a spy thriller and by definition a ""thinking"" movie.  Those of you who like this genre know who you are.  Everyone else, get Predators instead."
,stinky1,2010-11-29T03:19Z,"Very good quality: A-9, V-10.
To all those who think this movie sucked.  Grow the fuck up or go back to your comic book inspired action movies."
,N4T7NB,2010-12-05T18:31Z,"@stinky1

too fucking right"
,petergriffin325,2010-12-11T09:35Z,Thank you! I'm tired of all these little fags on here saying a movie sucks just because it couldn't hold their immature attention spans. A movie doesn't have to be all explosions and CGI crap that would never happen in real life.
