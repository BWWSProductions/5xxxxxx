Pearl Jam - Alive [promo].VOB



HQ rare promo music video. "Alive" was Pearl Jam's first single, and appeared 
on the band's debut album, Ten (1991). Written by guitarist Stone Gossard, 
"Alive" originated as an instrumental titled "Dollar Short" and was included 
on a demo tape circulated in hopes of finding a singer for the group. Vocalist 
Eddie Vedder obtained a copy of the tape and wrote lyrics that describe a 
fictionalized account of the time when he was told that the man he thought was 
his father was not actually his biological parent. "Alive" charted at number 
16 in the UK (the single was available only through import in the US). 

This music video was directed by Josh Taft, a childhood friend of Gossard, 
who would later direct the music videos for "Even Flow" and "Oceans". 
The black-and-white video consists of a filmed live performance of the 
band filmed on August 3, 1991 during a Pearl Jam concert at RKCNDY in 
Seattle, Washington. Drummer Matt Chamberlain can be seen drumming in 
the "Alive" video. Pearl Jam's future drummer Dave Abbruzzese was in 
the audience when the video was shot. It was his first encounter with 
the band as he had just arrived from Texas after being recommended for 
the band by Chamberlain and only knew the songs from the "Alive" single.
