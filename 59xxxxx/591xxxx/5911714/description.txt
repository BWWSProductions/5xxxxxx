Ringo Starr - Only You (And You Alone) [promo].VOB



Very HQ rare promo music video. "Only You (And You Alone)" is a pop song 
composed by Buck Ram in 1954. In 1974, Ringo Starr covered this song for 
his album Goodnight Vienna at the suggestion of John Lennon, and it became 
a number six hit on the US pop chart and reached number one on the easy 
listening chart in early 1975. Lennon plays acoustic guitar on the track, 
and recorded a guide vocal which was kept by producer Richard Perry. 
Harry Nilsson sings harmony vocals and appears with Starr in this amusing 
music video filmed on top of the Capitol Records building in Los Angeles.
