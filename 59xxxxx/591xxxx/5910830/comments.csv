,ooo003,2010-10-29T14:41Z,"It's working perfectly!

It wont run through disc channel, though. It says ""error 002"". But works flawlessly on neogamma with forced NTSC.

Now seeding."
,GeronimoX,2010-11-05T11:23Z,How do you fix the 002 error?
,fc322,2010-12-29T21:09Z,"I am in USA and use NTSC wii console. 

4.1U softmod

 This works fine via USB Loader GX but you must choose the game > settings > and set the first option as ""Forced NTSC"" or else the game is black and white.  With this option I can play any PAL game"
,ultamanl,2011-01-05T22:37Z,Any chance upload NTSC version of RB3?..
,-peas-,2011-01-14T07:46Z,thx works great on softmodded Wii [NTSC] with USB Loader.  No need to Force NTSC. Loads up perfectly on default settings.
