Just giving something back to the community. It took a bit of effort to get the 3 Chapters, and 4 Legends together, but here they are. Enjoy! And of course, if you really like it, and want to support the artist, go out and buy the music! :p
 


The Za FrÃ»mi saga

The Za FrÃ»mi saga consists of three albums by the band. The third was released on January 12, 2007. The saga is composed of a mixture of fantasy-inspired music and spoken dialogue, similar to radio theatre.

The first chapter of the saga: \"Za shum ushatar Uglakh\" (translated \"The Great Warrior Uglakh\") was released in 2000, and focuses on the adventures of a group of ocs, dagalush (smaller form of a goblin/orc) khapul (thin, orc-like creature), and slaves, who encounter a vampire. In \"Tach\" (translated \"Bone\"), the second chapter of the saga, which was released in 2001, the group begins a quest to find a bone staff, which has been divided into three parts. The chapter ends suddenly, mid-action, and was not resolved until the release of \"Shrak ishi za migul\" (translated \"Gathering in the Mist\") in January 2007.
