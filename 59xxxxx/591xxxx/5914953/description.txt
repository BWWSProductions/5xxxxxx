The CS-80V is the reproduction of the legendary Yamaha CS-80, which is
     considered by many as the "ultimate polyphonic synthesizer". More than
     25 years after its release, the time has come to rediscover a sound
     that has extensively contributed to the history of music...
     
     In 1976, Yamaha introduced the CS-80. The price tag ($6,900) put it
     out of reach of most musicians, and the weight (220 lbs or 100 kg)
     made it sometimes hard to use on the stage...But the qualities of the
     CS-80, considered as Japans first great synthesizer, made it
     immediately famous in the music industry.
     The CS-80 was popularised in the late 70's and early 80's by artists
     and groups like Toto, Jean-Michel Jarre, Keith Emerson, Stevie Wonder
     or Vangelis, who helped to turn this synthesizer into a real myth. 
     
     The CS-80V offers all the features of the original synth, plus a new
     generation of innovative features, taking the original design to a new
     elevated level: 
     
     * A modulation matrix 
     * A multitimbral mode 
     * An arpeggiator and a stereo delay 
     
     But is the sound of the CS-80V really close to the original? We would
     tend to say yes, as the synthesizer is based on TAE, the proprietary
     technology developed by Arturia, and already successfully used in the
     Moog Modular V.
