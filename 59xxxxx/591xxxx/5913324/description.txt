From Wiki:



Bootsauce was a Canadian rock band formed in Montreal in 1989. Often compared to Red Hot Chili Peppers[by whom?], they combined soul, funk and metal sounds and were considered by many to be ahead of their time. Bootsauce was Drew Ling (vocals), Pere Fume (guitar), Sonny Greenwich Jr. (guitar), Alan Baculis (bass guitar), and John â€œFatboyâ€ Lalley (drums).
