Melodic Trance

Shiki makes some very high quality melodic trance, his most successful album being Trancer's Dolls (2008). This album contains many remixes of his previous tracks, with the addition of violinist Hiroyuki Kato.


The tracks I personally enjoy the most from this album are: Sepia, Pure Ruby, IRiA, and Rose Quartz.


Sepia is my favorite track from the album, and has a great alternation between some amazing pad synths and piano solos.
Pure Ruby is fast-paced, relaxing, and very beautiful in its piano scales and violin solos.
IRiA is highly uplifting and well-paced with a great set of piano chord arrangements.
Rose Quartz has a darker feel to it, and with some bizarre use of rapid-phasing synth-plucks, and some light bitcrushing, can really put my mind to rest.

Enjoy!
