"Beautiful Dangerous" is the third track on the debut self titled solo album by former Guns N' Roses and current Velvet Revolver guitarist, Slash. It features Fergie of The Black Eyed Peas on vocals. During an interview, where Slash goes through each of his album tracks, he stated:
â€œ 	I got hip to Fergie being probably as good or better a rock singer than she is a pop singer. I heard her do Barracuda, the old Heart song, and I was like, fuckinâ€™ wow!

I ended up doing a couple of shows with her where she sang Barracuda and Sweet Child Oâ€™ Mine. Sheâ€™s one of the most phenomenal f***ing rock â€˜nâ€™ roll singers, male or female, Iâ€™ve ever heard.'
	â€
Slash told The Sun: "The track began as a piece of music I'd written as a score for a strip bar scene and it made me think of [Fergie]. I'm a guy and there's nothing sexier than seeing a cute girl sing rock 'n' roll." 

Though not released as an official single, the song managed to peak at number 11 on the Heatseekers Songs chart and number 58 on the Canadian Hot 100.

On August 27, it was announced that Slash was filming a music video for the song. Slash stated that "[The] concept is twisted; Fergie's idea."
