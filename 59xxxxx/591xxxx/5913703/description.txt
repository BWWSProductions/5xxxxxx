Only time will really tell whether Philadelphia-based band The War on Drugs is destined to be known as â€œthe band Kurt Vile used to be in,â€ but that sort of thing isnâ€™t keeping TWoD from pushing forward. The Future Weather EP is the follow-up to the bandâ€™s 2008 debut album, Wagonwheel Blues, and their ex-guitarist Kurt Vileâ€˜s star has certainly risen since that albumâ€™s release, but The War on Drugsâ€™ blend of laid-back indie-pop and Americana is back for another shot at the brass ring regardless.

The mini-album is full of spaced-out wonder. Take, for example, the knee-slapping Americana of â€œBaby Missiles,â€ a track reminiscent of Wagonwheelâ€™s highlight track â€œTaking The Farm.â€ Layered guitars, harmonica, and lead singer/songwriter Adam Granducielâ€™s entrancing vocals all sound fuzz-pedaled out. Then thereâ€™s the steady acoustic strum and electric guitar solos of â€œCominâ€™ Through,â€ the surreal folk vibe of â€œPile Of Tires,â€ and the slow-burning, 8-minute long album closer â€œThe History Of Plastic,â€ a lament about being used and discarded like, you guessed it, a piece of plastic. If the dense and enchanting Future Weather is any indication of the forecast for the bandâ€™s next full-length, which is in the works, then fans have much to look forward to.
