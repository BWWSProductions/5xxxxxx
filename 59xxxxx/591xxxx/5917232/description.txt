           Michael Brown's birthday begins with a telephone call          
           from his estranged, drug addicted brother Tobey. Tobey is      
           totally unaware that it is his older brother's birthday,       
           but he is very aware that his car is broken, and he begs       
           Michael to drive him on various apparently legitimate,         
           vital errands. As Bruce Springsteen has astutely noted,        
           "a man who turns his back on his family just ain't no          
           good". So Michael puts off his seemingly romantic              
           birthday plans, and with his brother embarks on a              
           sketchy, meandering day long odyssey though the mysteries      
           of Los Angeles County. As the day wears on, it becomes         
           clear that this drive will lead them to some very              
           unexpected destinations.
