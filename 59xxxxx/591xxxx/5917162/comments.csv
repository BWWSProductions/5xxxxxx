,AtotehZ,2010-12-01T05:12Z,"Assuming the End-NLSubs I see around are by the same people you need to replace the dude that made the english subs for this.

They are so horrible... Normally saying something like ""Every to every other line had mistakes in them"", that isn't the case here, that's the sad truth. Very often the mistakes were so bad that it became impossible to make out what was being said.

Having struggled with deciphering what was mistake and what was real for a while I decided to try to ignore the subs... They simply ruined it."
