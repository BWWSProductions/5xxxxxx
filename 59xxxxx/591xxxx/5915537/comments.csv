,SDguy,2010-10-27T20:56Z,"Confused. Loads of peeps been waiting for this yet no seeders. Even more strange that over 2000 are downloading a cam version. Even more strange that this is the first upload from a ""trusted pirate"" yet still no seeders?

Nevermind. :-~"
,SDguy,2010-10-27T20:58Z,"PS. Forgetting my manners.

Cheers for the upload, mate. "

(Scaled to fit my 17"" screen)

*Hight resolution in image missing 
*Watermarks pops up now and then - in the corner and in the center of the screen
*Pretty poor quality on V and A

I will wait for a quality torrent of this movie."
