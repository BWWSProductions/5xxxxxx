On a fall night in 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer programming genius Mark

global social network and a revolution in communication.
A mere six years and 500 million friends later, Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history...
but for this entrepreneur, success leads to both personal and legal complications.
