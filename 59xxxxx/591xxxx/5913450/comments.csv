Quite a nice surprise this was! Best f*ckin' movie I've seen in a long time. Gangster family situation with a well cooked script and with tension dripping off. Very good cast too. Finally a movie that makes living the gangster life look not so heroic and pretty like these suckers in hollywood try to bore you with all the time.

Thumbs up for the upload and the movie!"
