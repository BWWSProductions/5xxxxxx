THIS IS WAR aka SEVERE CLEAR â€“ This is a very different view point to the Iraq war, told and filmed by one of the US soldiers. Its a great illustration of how these young men and women are put in stupid locations to fight stupid wars by the most stupid politicians.


As part of the first wave in the War on Terror, First Lieutenant Mike Scotti (awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal with Combat â€œVâ€) served on the front lines during the 21 day advance to Baghdad. His experiences in Afghanistan as well as Iraq put him face to face with the sobering realities of war on a daily basis. Severe Clear offers an unflinching look at life on the battlefield through the eyes of someone who was there.
