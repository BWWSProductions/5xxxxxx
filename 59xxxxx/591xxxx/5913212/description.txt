Info:
The Curse of the Hedgehog is a documentary that tells the story of a
Gipsy family, the Baesis. The nomadic family lives in extreme poverty
and survival is difficult. The documentary shows their struggle during
the winter months, when they spend entire days walking, in search of a
way to trade their handicrafts for food and other essentials.

Notes:
General audio bitrate is very poor because is bad recorded mono voice.
Since there is some panning (as you can hear in sample) encoded stereo.
