"All in the Family"

Addison and Sam's relationship is strained when 
they disagree over the treatment and safety of a 
comatose patient who has become pregnant, while 
Pete and Charlotte are faced with the ethical 
dilemma of revealing the HIV status of a patient 
who has been in a serious auto accident. Violet 
crosses some boundaries with Pete's family as 
she gets caught up in the fray of Lucas's first 
Halloween.

Enjoy  :)
