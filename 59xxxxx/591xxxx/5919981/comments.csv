[V],twentyforty,2010-10-29T17:13Z,"Thanks.

@AnshSach: MF season one is still available by direct download - but only as extra-small [quark]. Whole season (24 episodes) is only 798 MB, but if you have no prior contact with [quark] encodes - maybe is better to stay away.
I can send you my MU link set as reply to your e-mail.

L2me - I have all - but cannot upload season pack for relatively unpopular encode."
