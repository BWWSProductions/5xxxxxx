[V],nos1977,2010-10-26T15:57Z,"Seepage is the second EP by rapper Tech N9ne, to be released on October 25, 2010. 
The EP will consist of five tracks that were written recently after Tech witnessed 
Krizz Kaliko's breakdown after receiving bad news, and soon after, receiving news 
that his mother was back in the psych ward.[1] The beats that appear on the EP were 
purchased by the artist intended for his studio album K.O.D. but went unused during 
the sessions. The EP, just like K.O.D. and the Lost Scripts, is broken up into 
3 sections: ""Anger"", ""Madness"" and ""The Hole""... Also put two bonus tracks... PEACE...
