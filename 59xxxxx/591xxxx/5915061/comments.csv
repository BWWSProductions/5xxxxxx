,Skloped,2011-01-19T04:10Z,it will be black and white for people with wii's from america.
,TacoSteve,2011-02-05T02:44Z,"It's only in black and white for those who aren't savvy enough to force their region.

Works perfectly on the latest IOSs with the latest USB Loader GX, it autoforces regions and works like a charm."

Although I haven't downloaded this torrent yet, I would suggest using 'Verbatim DVD-R' for all Wii games, I don't have any problems at all with these discs!"
