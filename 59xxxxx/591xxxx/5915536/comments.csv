,PhilLesh12,2010-10-27T21:00Z,"yes, it has watermark, and the annoying warning during the first minute or so.

So what.  You should have an attention span wide enough to tune that out. ;)"
,ashtinmosherbadass,2010-10-28T08:50Z,how do you seed?
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-10-28T10:45Z,How do you seed?? lol.. I love those types of questions.. it's called Google your answer. But to seed you download the torrent then you just never delete it and let it seed and upload to other users.

If you don't like facebook and don't want think this movie is worth watching, then don't watch it. If you have nothing better to do than write angry comments on TPB about a movie you don't want to watch, then you seriously need to get out of your moms basement, get a job, and make some friends that you can interact with without having to connect to the internet."
