,Sibeckham,2010-10-30T18:56Z,Thanks!!!!!
,(CZ)24online,2010-10-30T22:49Z,thx :)
,TwoPac,2010-10-31T18:48Z,English subtitles are highly appreciated by non english speakers. Makes it so much easier. I won't download this because of no subs. But keep up the good work anyways.
,FilureN_FFS,2010-10-31T19:16Z,"Seed motherfuckers ...please? *Kitten eyes*

Is it the real deal?"
,AnDyKoLe,2010-10-31T19:44Z,@TwoPac there is something called subdivx.com there u can find subs.. :S
,stedenfeldt9,2010-11-01T20:42Z,We know there is something called subdivx and many other sites with subs. But it is still fucking convenient when they are included. 
,Daggi_92,2010-11-03T20:26Z,Wait? Did you just ask for more? Moremoremore? Free shit is free. I'm happy about it.
,jeanphilt,2010-11-05T00:30Z,"well you can download subtitles from many websites
just google it : srt scott pilgrim
then you will need a player supporting srt files ...
For example, WD HD TV supports it  ... 100$ ..."
,HeroHashNick,2010-11-05T15:18Z,Seeda PLZ!! Måste se den :D
,outzaidur,2010-11-06T14:13Z,audio sounds a bit iffy otherwise fine. 
,Motorman2,2010-11-08T21:33Z,So does this have the Blu-ray extras and stuff or is it just the movie?
,limited305,2010-11-09T07:24Z,"I just saw this and Kick Ass. 
It was a HELL of a day to say the least."
,JHBfromNO,2010-11-09T18:49Z,How come this is the real deal when it's supposed to be out on BluRay today?
,Pinkertow,2010-11-10T09:22Z,"@JHB - How do you think new albums get leaked?

2420 seeds, 7797 downloading. No chance of this getting anywhere for a while."
,Ckeaschz,2010-11-10T21:35Z,"@twopac
wtf dude you CAN read it but dont understand it.. subtitles are like the better of two evils when the other is dubbing.. its still evil! it always takes my focus away from the screen!! even though speak it as a first language. fuck subtitles i want the picture to run as it was intended! completely free of shit"
,capridrifter,2010-11-14T05:38Z,"@ Ckeaschz You can always choose not to download the srt file, or delete it if you don't like it.


Remember guys if you like it buy it!...when you have the money for it.:("

,Joris44,2010-12-06T18:25Z,"Why does this have 2300+ seeders, but my speed still stays on 0.9kb/s? "
,Joris44,2010-12-06T18:40Z,"It has 2300+seeders, but still my speed is around 1kb/s? "
,bailey_bat,2010-12-12T08:42Z,Quite possibly the slowest torrent I've ever seen x.x I could comb the beach for pennies and go BUY this faster.
,Phov,2011-01-01T17:47Z,"Nice upload. Too bad thereâ€™s no subs. 
Thanks anyways."
,TheBlackWhirlwind,2011-01-03T16:12Z,"Great upload, great picture quality, thanks! But I appear to be having problems with the audio - I cannot get any audio. 

Does anyone else have this problem? Do I need to download a codec? Any help would be appreciated, thanks!"
,TheBlackWhirlwind,2011-01-04T17:20Z,"Aha! Solved it!

Anyone having trouble with the audio should download the AC3 Filter at: http://ac3filter.net/projects/ac3filter/releases"
,Sfinx_P,2011-01-08T09:27Z,Excellent!!! Thank you uploader ;)
,Kcirtap13,2011-01-10T20:13Z,"@TwoPac you can download the subtitles for the movie just copy the exact name of it in google and write ""Subtitles"" behind it you will find subtitles and a advice for a player: VLC media player"
,BubiMandril,2011-02-16T14:05Z,"I'm thinking about burning this to a DL DVD, will this fit. I think the actual capacity is 7.92GB and this movie is 7.94GB. Am I wrong or is it not going to work. Thanks in advance for any replies."
