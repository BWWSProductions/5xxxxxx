Handling the Undead
UNABRIDGED
by John Ajvide Lindqvist
Narrated by Steven Pacey

Publisher's Summary

In his new novel, John Ajvide Lindqvist does for zombies what his previous novel, Let the Right One In, did for vampires.

Across Stockholm, the power grid has gone crazy. In the morgue and in cemeteries, the recently deceased are waking up. One grandfather is alight with this, with hope that his grandson will be returned, but one husband is aghast at what his adored wife has become.

Here is a horror novel that transcends its genre by showing what the return of the dead might really mean to those who loved them.
