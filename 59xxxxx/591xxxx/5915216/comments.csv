,coolhandz69,2010-10-29T11:16Z,"Don't hit and run!  Seed for the rest of us.

2 days going now and only at 3%.  I put disc 1 on high priority so that it'll finish first, if others do that it will help speed things up.  Then when disc 1 is done, put disc 2 on high and so forth.

Thanks for the upload!  I can't wait to watch this."

,BigPoppaCherry,2011-03-03T10:33Z,"I recently finished downloading this about 2 weeks ago and have not been able to get any of the files to work properly. It shows up as a .img file on my computer and every time I try to open any of them, be it with the default program it was assigned (Irfanview), or with Windows Media Player, Winamp, or Windows Media Classic Player with the k-lite codec pack, nothing wants to render it or play it. Please help, Ive wanted to watch these ever since I first saw them come out. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. I'll continue to seed for the next month, if I get no responses or I cant get them to work then I'm sadly probably going to delete them. Thanks in advance.
