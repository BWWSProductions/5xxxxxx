,longdistance,2010-10-27T17:48Z,"Thanks again. Enjoy getting Stargate Universe in a smaller format. Your new experiment with bundling works fine for me.

Request: My kids like Sarah Jane Adventures. They come out Monday and Tuesday, 1 episode divided in two. Could be bundled together."

@longdistance: I have ugly experience with ALL TV shows which even remotely targeted children as audience. These shows are number one on Hit&Run list, it is just getting and grabbing and zero seeding. Who are the downloaders is self-evident, and grown-ups haven't taught them well in matter of sharing. Beside. Sarah Jane fells in my most crowded days - and I cannot make an exception.

Even this ""packing"" is one of the oldest tricks to get rid of all kinds of automatized, ""blind"" downloading, and only regulars read the content and torrent description.
And - LOL, beleive it or  not - I get e-mails with questions ""Would I be charged for whole torrent or just for files I have downloaded?"""
,skillet92,2010-10-27T18:58Z,"I wont be downloading any of these serials!

but Thanks for the upload ...i know ppl would be dyin for this! :)

,lilars26,2010-10-27T19:36Z,Thanks 20-40 for No Ordinary Family and Parenthood and My 1st ep of Glee.Have to see what the buzz is about but aiso have a feeling that it is not for me.
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-27T20:02Z,"@lilars26: LOL, I have no frikkin clue why  have I uploaded all episodes of Glee plus two extended pilots, why I have like gazillion downloads - I hit 384 000 just with ONE director's cut pilot - and last but not least - why for fuck's sake I have lowest number of both Thanks and comments in general on all my Glee uploads. Maybe I finally should watch even one episode... and get the clue..."

,lilars26,2010-10-28T01:38Z,"@ 20-40 and milyaa

,hazel13,2010-10-28T08:19Z,Thanks again 20/40...=>
,borky12,2010-10-28T08:37Z,"Dude !  .. you rock !!   

However with the inception of the new appletv  ..  i still have to convert from 480p to 272 or 320  to use these  :)  

still i think you have got to be one of the most consistant guys i have seen here :)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-28T11:26Z,"@borky12: Even if QuickTime/AppleTV compatibility heavyhearted has been dropped, some of the 480p (even majority!) can be played without conversion. iPod compatibility has been gone for sure. You should try to play file and see is it accepted or not. It is confusing because I use 4.1 level for 480p (and CABAC not CAVLC anymore, and exclusively) and AppleTV claims 3.0 as needed. Frame size is not the problem as AppleTV accepts 720p without problems. Even 320p use CABAC and b-frames, but - almost 100% of 320p encodes (my) - are compatible even if encoding parameters doesn't ""sound"" as compatible. Mystery."
,cindal,2010-10-28T21:39Z,thanks
