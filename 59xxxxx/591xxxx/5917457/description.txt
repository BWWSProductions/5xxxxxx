CrossOver Mac allows you to install many popular Windows applications and
games on your Intel Mac. Once installed, your application integrates
seamlessly in OS X. Just click and run your application directly from the
OS X Finder. Clicking a Windows file or document including email
attachments will launch the appropriate Windows program, allowing you to
work on the files. Best of all, you do it all easily and affordably,
without needing a Microsoft operating system license.
