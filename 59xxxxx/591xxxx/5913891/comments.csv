have some patioence dude..."
,blakp,2010-10-28T00:08Z,"the big bang theory...not necessarily so true. i've been seeding it since the day i got it. haven't stopped seeding once. so folk like myself do actually seed tv shows. i think they are a good look as far as what's offered. all that to say thank you for all you offer and thank you for this trilogy, ooo. some of us truly appreciate the great work that you do."
,funforall,2010-10-28T00:51Z,You need that green skull like yesterday. Thanks for the movies and I will leave my short list of series for TDW for when he comes back with the hope that he considers them. I made sure they are classics to encourage seeding and positive comments.
