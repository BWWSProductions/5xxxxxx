It's strange how a lot of people here love US shows and think you guys do it better, when it seems a lot of you there think that way about our stuff.

I think right now Spooks is the only UK thing I watch. Currently loving Tru Blood, Mad Men, Supernatural, and hating Smallville... but been watching it for 10 years so have to finish it, finally the last season!"
