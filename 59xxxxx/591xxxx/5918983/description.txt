Su Qi-Er retired from his life as a renowned Qing dynasty
general in order to pursue his dream of a family and his
own martial arts school. However, Su's peaceful life is
shattered when his vengeful adopted brother, Yuan Lie,
kidnaps his son and leaves Su for dead. Saved from his
demise by his wife Ying and the reclusive doctor Yu, Su
resolves to perfect his technique so that he may defeat
Yuan Lie and reunite his family. Aided by the mystical
"God of Wushu" and the eccentric "Old Sage," Su masters
the art of Drunken Boxing, and embarks on the path that
would eventually give rise to the legend of the "King of
Beggars."
