it amazes me that some your uploads have a negative quality of usually 12-15..I personally don't think you'll ever find 15 folk that can be bothered rating any upload, saying that to me it means that it's 1 sad little individual that hasn't got the intelligence to leave a comment simply minus rates over and over again.

I know I don't need to say this, but don't let anyone put you off uploading ;)  Thanks"
