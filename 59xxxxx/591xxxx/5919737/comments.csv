[V],meech,2010-10-31T02:12Z,"Thank you for the hd content.  I am always surprised how many seeders/leechers are downloading non-hd and so few downloading HD content.  I have no clue why someone would want inferior quality when superior quality is offered at no cost more.  Size difference is negligible, especially considering the cheap cost of hard drive space.  I just watch and delete anyway.  Go figure."

10 people going at 100kb/sec is 1MB/sec!!!! It only takes 10 freakin' seeders to get a decent speed."
