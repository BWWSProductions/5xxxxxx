Fun Boy Three with Bananarama - It Ain't What You Do.... [promo].VOB



HQ rare promo music video. It Ain't What You Do (It's the Way That You Do It)" is a song written by jazz musicians Melvin "Sy" Oliver and James "Trummy" Young. It was first recorded in 1939 by both Jimmie Lunceford and Ella Fitzgerald. Terry Hall of Fun Boy Three owned a copy of Bananarama's previous single "Aie a Mwana" and after seeing an article about the trio in The Face he decided he wanted them to sing background vocals on this song, solely based on the fact that he liked their look. "It Ain't What You Do...." became a big hit in the UK, climbing to number four in the UK singles chart. The success of this single also prompted Bananarama to return the favor and have Fun Boy Three sing on their next single "Really Saying Something".
