Thanks for the encode/upload. Got to love the 'zombie' shows. Makes a nice change from vampires with feelings.

It makes a difference; shows you care and that his work is appreciated for the genius that it is!

Cheers

,kzrockz,2010-10-29T10:24Z,"why such large size?although it is 1h 7min show,larger thn ur usuals.neways hw would u rate this program let me knw."
,redvanilla,2010-10-29T10:26Z,@twentyforty: Thank you for your time and effort to make so many good quality files available! I am really looking forward to watching this show. Have a nice day ...
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-29T11:13Z,"@redvanilla: Thank you. Strange how I see 1283 downloads, but only you stood in my defense. I would remember that.

@kzrockz: Find smaller-sized one. It  is normal XviD, not H264 (which comes in today's TV pack and would be 243 MB). I woke at 20 to 2 AM up just to post this my XviD and I do not appreciate bitching and mourning about my public service, which is for free, right?"
,kzrockz,2010-10-29T12:14Z,"hey,just wanted to knw that is it wrth as a shw coz i hv preety bad net speed,so dnt get pissed off.just asking.it takes more thn 3hrs fr me 2 dwload 300mb file so just asked u a favour.sry if it hurts ur feeling."

thanks  2040
:)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-29T13:42Z,"@kzrockz: Yeah, I know that, that's why I have mentioned smaller H264 which will be in TV pack two hours from now. This was for people who can't wait. Anyhow... you can wait till next week and grab normal release after the official airing - but probably little over 1 h long and therefore bigger than common 41-45 minutes long shows.

@houruoha: Thanks."

,iamabibii,2010-10-31T22:28Z,"@twentyforty: Thank you! :) I've been a huge fan of your work for a while now, and I always try to seed for at least a week or as long as my speed makes it possible, and never felt the need to register because of that. I just registered just to say thanks, and hopefully you wont get tired uploading great stuff here. :) Don't mind them jealous people. You know your work and we know your work and as far as I know, your uploads are ALWAYS great! thanks again! "
