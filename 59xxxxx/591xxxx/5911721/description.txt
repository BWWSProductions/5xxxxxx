Sexting is the act of sending sexually explicit messages or photographs, primarily between mobile phones. It is a result of advances in technology enabling new forms of social interaction which allows photographs and videos, which are intrinsically more explicit, to seduce and tease primarily teenagers, like Jordan and Tristyn.
