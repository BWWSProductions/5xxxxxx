,Saki33,2010-11-18T00:39Z,"I'm having same problem as others. Added all the serial numbers and that worked, until tried to burn something. It wouldn't proceed w/o patent ok and to get that you have to go online. Once you do that it is all over because then your serial nos. are recognized as invalid because they will have a record of all the duplicate nos from everyone who has downloaded this. I had disabled all online permissions, but they get you with the patent ok. It is not going to work now."

,belterbry,2011-01-02T16:58Z,"I have downloaded a few versions of this and they all work fine except for the blu ray authoring, after putting in the serial it says it has worked, but when I try and use it in nero express, its not there, this is the same for every nero version I have tried, any ideas how I can get it to work?"

[V],Scrufuss,2011-08-10T10:49Z,"Same issue as the others, except I go to use Nero VISION and it requires a patent activation thingy. So I backed out and am waiting to find the sacred number.
@iamuthen That number is for Nero Burning Rom"
