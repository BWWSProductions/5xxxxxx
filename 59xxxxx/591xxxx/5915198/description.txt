Life can be tough for a man who teaches        
at a school for a living, lives in a DDA flat  
in Delhi and is coping with the double digit   
inflation rates and single digit increments in 
his salary. Add to that, a teenage daughter,   
a fast-track son and a wife who loves the      
good life. The life of the Duggal's is         
passing by in simply taking care of the basics.
Until one day, they decide to dream.           
Their ticket to dreaming comes in the form     
of a wedding invitation. An innocent little    
wedding invitation. What follows is a journey  
of chaos, realizations, calculations,          
confrontations and bonding. This crazy         
Duggal's will fight it out at home ....
