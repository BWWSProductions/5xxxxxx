,pablo48,2010-11-01T04:52Z,"New to bit torrents and was downloading an old Breaking Bad episode of yours and reading comments.   LIke what I have seen so far so will probably use often.   What is seeding and uploading and how does that help people with slower connections? It sounds like it could be a complicated explanation, if so is there a reference you could point me to so I can read up on this?  I figure if I am going to be using this I should contribute.  and thanks for the shows!!"
