,sucksucker,2010-11-19T18:48Z,"""high quality WMA format""

Fail."
,garbagedrew,2010-12-05T07:00Z,"Yeah, maybe a decade ago WMA was inferior to other formats, but now it is slowly but steadily gaining ground. WMA files tend to have better sound quality than MP3s when recorded at the same bitrate. WMA files take up less space than MP3 files for identical sound quality, but you may not be able to hear the difference between the two depending on your sensitivity and the particular recording. Another potential disadvantage to the MP3 format is that at lower bitrates the MP3 format's quality has been known to suffer, while WMA sounds much better at comparable low bitrates.

In addition, the MP3 format does not support 5.1 Surround Sound, which the WMA format supports. Also, there is no MP3 Lossless codec but WMA does support Lossless. It's no wonder why Verizon Wireless has now chosen this as the standard in which to offer its music subscription service. Also more and more streaming services are using the WMA/WMV codec.
And finally, METADATA. WMA's support a LOT more metadata than any other format. That comes in handy when you start to get over 50,000 songs in your library and want to keep as much info as possible. WMA's can have multiple genres (like these ones) while MP3s can only have one. (Use iTunes to convert one of these files and you will see it removes a lot of metadata that is visible in Media Player 12)

What it boils down to is this: Personal Preference
If you don't like or want WMA files, then don't download this. No one is forcing you. "

,hettinger,2011-01-12T07:49Z,"Hey to clarify, wma files are better.  The shitty part about wma's is that not everything plays them.  LITERALLY EVERYTHING will play a mp3 with a speaker, enough said."

,SomewaySomehow,2011-04-08T07:10Z,"""High quality WMA""? Epic fail.

And you are as dumb as you can ever be. ""WMA has more quality than MP3 and takes less space"" - doesn't that seem a bit awkward to you? I mean, lets be very simple: .wav files take loads of space because no frequencies were removed, therefore, taking full space. Since the mp3 is limiting the frequencies to what the human ear can capture (and along with it goes loads of vital frequencies that are core components of the instruments/voice's natural timbre) in order for the file to be LIGHTER, don't you think that the .wma file is cutting even MORE frequencies, worsening the quality? It's as simple as that, no rocket science.

Plus, most of the people these days are listening to music through iTunes or Apple devices such as iPods, iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, iMacs, etc, and .wma (WINDOWS media archive) isn't supported so iTunes has to convert it, worsening the quality, taking up space and most important of all: time. 1,31GB's converting. How long does that take on an average computer? It simply fails when it comes to compatibility.

Now don't you think that I'm just trolling, I'm giving you credit for gathering the extras and the remix/b-sides albums as well (although there are more torrents available with those, on mp3 320kb), but still, good job on that. But .wma?! Seriously? It simply sucks. You will never get more audio quality from a file as light as mp3. Whoever wants more quality than mp3 320kb, either grabs FLAC files or .wav files, NEVER .wma. -.-

Oh and btw, that .wma lossless codec is bullshit, the only lossless yet compressed file is .m4a (APPLE). Even Trent himself joked about .wma files when he announced the lol-release of Strobe Light on nine inch nails' website. "
,garbagedrew,2011-04-08T18:48Z,"Someway Somehow

You clearly don't understand how compresion works. That is how a WMA works. It uses more complex mathematical algorithms to encode the file. Think, by your logic, even an MP3 would sound terrible since it would have to be a tenth the quality of a FLAC since it is a tenth the size. Just think of a rar or zip file. It's a file often much smaller that the original but doesn't lose any data. It all gets put back during decompression. When you hit play on a WMA, you are decompressing it on the fly. It is a fact that any device uses more memory/power to play a WMA than an MP3 for that reason.  So thus the tradeoff for going with WMA over MP3 is not lost sound quality, just increased processing. That's all. Besides, why waste space on bits that simply are there to say ""there is no sound at this frequency or this one, or this one too.""  That is what a flac does, and to a certain extent, an MP3 too. When you filter out frequencies that didn't have sound in the first place, you aren't really losing anything. I use quality codecs and software to ensure high quality encodong. And SomewaySomehow, you shouldn't say ""most people"" because that's just not true. Not all, but more and more people I know are shifting away from the greedy Appple company.  And I think that you are just a sore fanboy because you would have to convert this to get it to work on anything apple.   Just read my comment from 1210-12-5 if you still need more convincing that WMA is the way to go. "
,BROKEN81,2011-05-18T21:03Z,"awesome collection and wma ftw!!!!!!!! f the guy who dont agree, f apple too. i own a zune"
,picklejam,2011-07-23T06:04Z,"It's called FreeRip3,  convert wma to mp3 or vice versa, you geeks need to get a life!  Thanks for the awsome music garbagedrew!  maybe the geeks should learn more about music than file formats!!!"
,Jardon21,2011-11-01T04:33Z,Wma sucks :(
,UhOk,2012-05-03T07:28Z,"Why is it that every Nine Inch Nails torrent has really crappy quality? Come on, people. 192kbps mp3. It's not difficult to do at all. Maybe in 1998 it was, but this is 20-fucking-12, and LAME has been around for a long, long time. WMA, give me a break."
