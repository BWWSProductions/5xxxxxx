This is one hell of an album, three discs, thirty-eight songs, covering a huge range of electronic sub-genres, a work compiled between kors k and a variety of Bemani artists. kors k, who also goes by Teranoid and a few other aliases, is a highly successful artist in the Japanese electronic music scene. This album has a ton of variety, with many of the tracks difficult to stick into two or even three sub-genres.

Some tracks of note:
Evergreen. It's hard to describe this track, it's house, it's trance, it's something immense, and it's something that takes your mind to another world.

Programmed Sun. His highest ranked track on last.fm, eight minutes long, and too difficult to insert into an electronic subgenre. Listen to it, enjoy it.

Oarfish. A blend of techno, rave, and hardcore. Some pretty cool pads and violin riffs.

SigSig (beatnation remix). Bouncy and happy, if you like your hardcore very happy, it should put you in a good mood, you might also be interested in Smooooch DJ Command (Remix).

D, neat blending, transitions through breakbeat, house, hardcore, and some really intense lead synths. Similar to Film.




Really, just give each track across each disc a chance. There is so much on here, the cutting edge of underground electronic music, with such huge variety, that you should be able to find something that justifies keeping this album in your library.
