The basics:
-----------
This is just a simple breakout-style game.  Do your best to
break all the bricks on the screen without dropping the ball.
If you break all the bricks, then you will move on to the 
next board.  If you are really good, you'll be able to beat
the board pack and hopefully have the new high score.

To play, pick a board pack and click the Play button.  Don't
forget to grab the power-ups during the game... they will 
make the game a lot more fun.  Blue power-ups are usually good,
red power-ups are usually bad, and gray power-ups can be
either good or bad based on your situation.
