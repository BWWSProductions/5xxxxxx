Trancer's Dolls
Shiki
[CRTS-0003] 2008
MP3 LAME 3.98.4 320kbps
Melodic Trance



To put it simply, Shiki is god-tier trance. Violins, pianos, pads, and very pretty synthesizers make up his compositions. Trancer's Dolls, Cristears, and Dramatic Irony are all albums I can listen to in their entirety, and take off my headphones feeling euphoric.
Enjoy the album, it's only seven tracks long, and hopefully you'll find something you like. That Pure Ruby....
