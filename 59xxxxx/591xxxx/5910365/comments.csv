[V],twentyforty,2010-10-25T21:11Z,"@skillet92: Ep. 1-3 are out, and I'll  download the sources and if they're good, would be encoded. Soon.

@punk67: No problem..."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-25T22:54Z,@skillet92: Too ugly to touch. Sorry.
,skillet92,2010-10-26T05:23Z,"Its okk bro.!
but the episodes after 1 & 2 ...have pretty good quality!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-26T08:47Z,"@skillet92: Out there is a lot of confusion - in reality, in season one, only three episodes have been aired. Confusion is caused by so called episode one (which belongs in kind of ""preview"" or season 00), available through few forums/boards, what is a patchwork of fifty web-ripped mini-sodes (approx. FIFTY where some are few seconds long) and naming of actually aired episodes is shifted by that. Episode 1 become Ep. 6 part 1, ep. 2 got label ep. 7 part 2 and so on and on. Pretty stupid. And ... I do have wide-screen sources of all three - but quality is so bad that I would encode them only if you insist and ONLY if you read this and write me back."
,skillet92,2010-10-26T09:29Z,"i know all the confusion!
the episodes from e03-e07 are a pack of mini episodes which are available in one single 700mb file!
i request u to encode all the episodes from e08 if the quality is of your standards ....or else u can chuck it...i really have  no problem! "
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-26T10:00Z,"@skillet92: From forums:

...""episodes one and two are labeled as six and seven.""

...""The first 5 episodes consist of the 20 micro-episodes (not 50, sorry) divided into episodes in their intended running order."""
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-26T10:08Z,".... and in fact, you need ep. 3 not 8. That's what I meant, OK? I have it  It's named Hulk Versus the World. Is that correct?"
,skillet92,2010-10-26T10:34Z,"Bro.!

which will air on 27th Oct ""Some Assembly Required""
