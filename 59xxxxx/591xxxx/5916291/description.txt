Cindy is over at her married friend's place because her washer and dryer aren't working and she needs to do some laundry. While she is finishing up the towels, Christian the husband comes over to her needling her about the spin cycle and wanting to be alone. She doesn't like the "spin cycle" but she LOVES the real thing. Christian is more than willing to help her out with that.....as long as he doesn't have to fold towels.
