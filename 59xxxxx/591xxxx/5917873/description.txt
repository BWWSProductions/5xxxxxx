"Health Risks of Genetically Engineered Food"

with Jeffrey Smith


Jeffrey Smith is author of Seeds of Deception, exposing industry and government lies about the safety of the genetically engineered foods we are eating. Seeds of Deception reveals how industry manipulation and political collusion, not sound science, allowed dangerously genetically engineered food into our diet.


.....
As a bonus, I am including in this torrent an interview that Jeffrey Smith did with Jeff Rense the day before this episode of Guns and Butter aired.

================================================

"Guns & Butter" investigates the relationships among capitalism, militarism and politics. Maintaining a radical perspective in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, "Guns & Butter: The Economics of Politics" reports on who wins and who loses when the economic resources of civil society are diverted toward global corporatization, war, and the furtherance of a national security state.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
