Biography:
While Janne Da Arc fans were disappointed in January 2007 because the group took a break and its members decided to focus on their solo careers, they could feel a little thrill when vocalist of Janne Da Arc, started yasu with his solo project. He had not yet made an official announcement, but that does not appear intimidated yasu of secret and during May and early June, conducted several live events around the country.
In June, there was the announcement of the beginning of Acid Black Cherry to appear on the official website of Janne Da Arc. this was not the only warning, however, the group's first single, "SPELL MAGIC" will be released in July.
The single announced in advance was very well received, and for recording yasu was working with several well known artists, such as SUGIZO (SKIN, ex Luna Sea) and SHUs (ex La'cryma Christi). Live was helped by Chisato (PENICILLIN), YUKI (DUSTAR-3) and many more musicians.
Acid Black Cherry's popularity increased rapidly, yasu appeared in several magazines and many events on the radio, sometimes making appearances on the radio twice a day.
A second single was scheduled for release in September and we look forward to see what Acid Black Cherry will bring for the future!
