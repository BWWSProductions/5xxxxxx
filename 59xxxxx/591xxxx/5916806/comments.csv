,OhMyGuts,2010-10-28T10:42Z,"Three nuns were talking. The first nun said, ""I was cleaning in Father's room the other day and do you know what I found? A bunch of pornographic magazines."" ""What did you do?"" the other nuns asked. ""Well, of course I threw them in the trash."" The second nun said, ""Well, I can top that. I was in Father's room putting away the laundry and I found a bunch of condoms!"" ""Oh my!"" gasped the other nuns. ""What did you do?"" they asked. ""I poked holes in all of them!"" she replied. The third nun fainted."
