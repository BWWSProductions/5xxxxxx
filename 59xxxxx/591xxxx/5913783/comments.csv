,Sattori,2010-10-27T20:44Z,"Thanks!
Hate to say this, but they really screw this series up now. Cannot believe the scriptwriters are out of ideas so soon. No chance for a third season if they go on like that...Let's keep our fingers crossed for a little inspiration. "
,Sattori,2010-10-27T20:50Z,"Thanks!
Hate to say this, but they lost all the great inspiration from the first season. What has happened here? No chance for a third season if they crawl like this."
,Sattori,2010-10-27T20:51Z,Interesting that the comments come and go. Sorry for the double post.
,zoneone,2010-10-28T23:53Z,"@Sattori SGU has been a lot about character development, since the beginning... this ep seems to have deepened a certain relation.
I'd also say this ep is a homage to a certain British sci-fi story that has been filmed at least 2-3 times...
And this ep also attached nicely to previous episodes, and also laid a foundation for some possible story developments. The writers might have a plan... (I hope)."
,pimpmobile,2010-10-30T09:52Z,"this show is like a lame ass soap opera!  There is no action, even the so called actions scenes last 2 whole minutes then more pointless talking I've seen girls at a slumber party talk less than this crappy show.  What is up with all the gay ass pop/country music they keep playing? All the other stargates didn't have this crap.  I fear for the future when morons are entertained by something so redundant. "
,Sattori,2010-10-30T12:44Z,"@zoneone
You are right, this episode is far better than the ones before... There is much improvement when they skip the communication stones, which I really hate and of course the stupid Lucian alliance. I saw no really not the point in bringing this boring bunch of losers on board."
