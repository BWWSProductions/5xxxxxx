,Yamcha67,2010-10-30T17:43Z,Just posting to say that this official mac port is going to be about half as slow as playing it through bootcamp in Windows.. Valve has done a shit job porting this :P

,Shunnabunich,2010-10-31T18:18Z,"@Yamcha67: One might also say that Valve is doing everything they can on their end, and that Apple has done a shit job competing with DirectX (mainly because they couldn't care less about games if they tried)."

Yeah your probably right.."

Ah!  Please forgive me, I was a bit too bold in my previous message.  As for your problem - very strange.  Try deleting the preferences folder."

,natogun,2010-11-18T23:06Z,@Shunnabunich: Apple aren't the ones writing OpenGL. Whine at them if you think OpenGL is lacking and whine at the game companies for not using it.

,margitmayer,2010-11-20T08:50Z,"Hi. Fantastic Upload!
On my iMac, it basically runs very well. Very easy to install.

Small issues I have - if anybody know the answer I'd be happy. There are some annoying gaphic mistakes on the first part, object and ladders are not shown, and some times humans two (i only see the eyes and their teeth) Where at the same time funny, it is a bit annoying. Does anybody know how to fix that?

Great Upload Thank you!"

Anybody out there who know how I can make that stop?"

Actually when you switch on the in-game-console you can see several errors messages coming up.

Did anybody fix that problem yet?"

All of you with problems completing the game:
Open the console(ingame) and type in sv_cheats 1

Did i miss any steps r graphics card?"
,DFET,2011-11-11T11:07Z,"For those of you with the crashing at sequences and not saving prefs/savegames:

Right click the application -> Show Package Contents
Right click folder ""Contents"" -> Get Info
In the ""permissions"" section, choose R/W for current user/owner, R/W for group and R/W for everyone. Below, click on ""Apply to enclosed items..."" (Snow Leopard: click on the cogwheel. All versions: you may have to click the lock and enter admin credentials to unlock that function). Wait for progress bar to disappear, close all windows, start game, enjoy.

It may work with fewer rights too, maybe there was just one file inside with the wrong permissions, but that solution worked for me, and I can't see a security problem with R/W for everyone.

Feedback appreciated!"
