,DSIN,2010-10-29T13:49Z,"@mzk : dude... a movie or tv show is best wen watched in its original language...
iam watchin subbed anime for ages now...
its japanese .. yeah japanese...spanish is far too easy to understand.
i started with Dub & i thought the same thing like u...
but wen i watched same thing subbed...it was much better experience..
now i prefer watching anything in its original language... (dubs r annoying, they most likely say something which is not actually said, & some of the gr8est movies like this r not available in english)
i think these reasons r enuff ;)  

@prashant: thanx a lot dude... 
its gonna be a gr8 saturday for me ;)"
,kanha,2010-10-29T15:45Z,"@DSIN
i agree with u buddy....
original is best!"
[V],prashant22,2010-10-29T15:48Z,"@mzk
i too hv no idea this will be my first too..

@kanha,smasudi,Dev
welcome..."
,i_am_sid,2010-10-29T16:15Z,"@DSIN
You are right. A movie or video is best watched in its original language. 
I also love Japanese anime movies. Would you like to suggest some to me?"
,DSIN,2010-10-29T16:57Z,"@sid : i don't know how many anime movies u hav seen....
so here r some of my fav's...
princess mononoke (prashant will be doin it )
Spirited away
perfect blue (psychological thriller)
Paprika (inception got their idea from this)
grave of fireflies (tearjerking classic)
ninja scroll 
summer wars 
...
man it'll be a long list if i keep up...
which genre u like...??
& yeah ... if u r up for anime series... then do try DEATH NOTE.. its certainly one of the best plot i've ever seen (movie, tv show or anime)..
XD"
,jarman007,2010-10-29T17:02Z,"downloading now

sample looks great

acc. to me watching with subs is not as entertaining
watched city of god recently .it was a great movie but watching with subs is frustrating...watch down to read subs and see movie at same time.."

i got 2-3 requests for back to the future..so i'll do it...it was already in my list..

@mitzep
will think abt up..will tell u later after 10th nov.."
[V],prashant22,2010-10-30T09:54Z,"@mkz
he is famous because he is a very old uploader older than riddlera & kickass...so its obvious that he is famous...
he was the lone uploader(using mkv) back at that time and his size attracted people...

resolution make some difference...because when KA used to upload in 720x304 his quality wa nt that gr8 as it is now while using 720p...
bt main thing of all is bitrate...more the bitrate more the quality..."
,DSIN,2010-10-30T10:27Z,"@mzk : as prashant said... its not all abt resolution... video bitrate is the key factor in encoding... 
even mkvguy's rips r of good quality... but they r meant for pc viewing only... the quality is same(if not better) as axxo ones...in half the size... his 300 mb brrips r way better than 700 mb dvdrips... 
... dunno y he left :(
"
,kanha,2010-10-30T10:43Z,i  guess he is busy in lyfe now......
