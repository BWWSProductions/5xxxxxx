from original site:

"I've recently gone through all of my VHS collection and transferred them to my hard drive while my VHS player still works.

I came across a tape with the words "Get Up Kids, Sept '99" on it. After further review I have come to the conclusion that it's a bootleg show from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida from September 1999 that I most likely went to.


I got the idea to share this fromwho knew people still cared about them? Clearly I did the night I found myself googling whilst listening to all of my old emo (post and pre) records. Too bad I don't have a Braid bootleg. That would make me uber-alt."
