Pilot :
Icarus - there were some who called it Icarus (Dolph Lundgren). Everyone knew him as a divorced father working in the investment. However, they did not know about his dark side - Icarus is a professional, a Soviet assassin. Over the years he worked as an undercover agent in America when the Soviet Union disintegrated, while in exile he had no one to trust. He decided to break with the past by changing your identity. However, this art has failed him for a long time - being in Hong Kong has been recognized and has become a target for other killers ...
