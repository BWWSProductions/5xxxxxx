,Tainan,2010-10-28T00:32Z,"Thanks, as always, JWhitt.

Question:
Does anyone else notice a very pronounced sound fluctuation? (thats a real word Maria & Trickdaddy)
I seem to get a distinct rise & fall of volume with regularity.

Shut UP Maria!"

,Oot-Glit,2010-10-28T02:53Z,"Tainan, I've noticed these sound volume fluctuations for weeks now. Last night's torrent was distorting during the loud parts. Only JWhitt has any control over the recording and I'm not sure he's aware of the problem or not."
,thefizdude,2010-10-28T03:44Z,Thanks muchly J!!
[T],jwhitt62,2010-10-28T06:15Z,"I record these shows over the internet using a program called RedButton by RadioTime. I don't know why the volume fluctuates. I haven't noticed it, but where I work it's quite noisy and I usually have my volume turned all the way up. I don't know why the volume is fluctuating? Sorry."
