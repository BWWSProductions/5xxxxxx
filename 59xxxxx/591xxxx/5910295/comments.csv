,rusty559,2010-10-26T20:43Z,"someone needs to post a digitaly redone version of this to make it not look like 3d, because for us people with only one eye (like a real pirate) cant see depth, or three demensions, so i cant go to the movies to watch any 3d movies, thus i must resort to pirating"

it's kinda watchable, but the intro appears to be in 3D so the intro is kinda messed up, but for the rest it was perfectly watchable.

Had a good laugh :D"
,bungchow7,2010-10-27T02:46Z,its almost unwatchable as its a 3d movie and is out of focus the whole way thru.......
,shortyhoward,2010-10-27T20:00Z,not so great for a cam because its 3d
,lupeguill,2010-10-27T20:26Z,"Just in case, there is a some cut-off of a scene near 50 minutes mark.  Not sure if there was suppose to be something there or scenes were removed."

And no, it was not from any other file on there, it was from this file because it was specified on the paper. DO NOT TRUST THIS DOWNLOAD."

,flextm71,2011-02-12T21:34Z,"@GTFO1234, kattlauv, pyrocide, werein, and others

If you don't know how to keep your network secure, then you shouldn't be downloading in the first place. How many times do we have to say this... use Peerguardian or a similar program and/or use a proxy if you have to. I've been downloading for years with no problems."
,Torbax,2011-02-15T00:11Z,"Hey all,
Just wondering what all the fuss is about with those so called ""trackers"" ... I am just using bittorrent and I ain't got no trouble with any of this mumbojumbo..
And isn't there some kind of programm going round that makes 3D movies into normal movies ??...and If there is does anyone have a link or sumthin ?"
,nboisvy,2011-02-16T18:18Z,I guess we're going to have to wait till March8th when they release this on DVD to get a good quality torrent .... this is the only torrent I can't find any files worth downloading they're all awful shit.
,Sarkasmi,2011-02-17T09:20Z,"werein, so... where's the link then asshat?"
