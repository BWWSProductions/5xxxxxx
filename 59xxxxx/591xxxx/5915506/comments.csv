,ladderman22,2010-10-28T07:59Z,"hey twentyforty I hate to be one of the people who ask for stuff but have you ever heard of the show ""she spies""? and is there any chance of an upload of the second season?"

[V],twentyforty,2010-10-28T09:50Z,"@ladderman22: I am Natasha Henstridge fan and of course, I have watched all seasons on TV back then. But I have only season 1, 20 episodes x 400+ MB - and therefore, I could never do 8 GIGA season pack. Season 2 torrent has existed, but I never found the time (and allowance back then) for download - now, season 2 torrents are dead and no links for direct download can be found. You can try eDk (eMule, aMule) and look for it out there. "
,ladderman22,2010-10-29T08:25Z,"alright thanks anyway 
and yeah i have the 8 gig season one but the only one i found for season 2 is like 14 gigs and i love your small sized uploads so much i just thought i'd ask 
but i'll see what i can find elsewhere"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-29T11:24Z,@ladderman22: Be aware that Season 2 packs and separate episodes could be found - but Fox airing dubbed in Russian. Download just one episode just to be sure.
,ladderman22,2010-10-30T06:42Z,"haha alright i'll check it out
thanks man"
