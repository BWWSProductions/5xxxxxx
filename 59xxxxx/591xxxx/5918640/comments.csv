,ddskill11,2010-11-18T04:00Z,Hey guys im new to the uploading torrent scene and i was just wondering if there is a way to increase my upload speeds as everyone is reporting slow downloads
,Mile9086,2010-11-27T23:06Z,where is the key
,iRshadow,2010-12-09T19:50Z,"ok, 1. Key is Missing, but found other offline keys

2. because you said in the directions to copy over cracked content that included a battle.net file, is it safe to play online?"
,ddskill11,2010-12-12T04:57Z,@iRshadow unfortunately as with most torrented games the online will not work
,dr23,2010-12-16T17:31Z,"Ok, whenever I go to update it using the update.bat after I move it over to the Starcraft II folder, it says ""There is no patch file to apply."" Is there anyway to solve this or get around it so that I can play?"
,jollypop,2010-12-18T03:53Z,where can you find an offline key?
,jollypop,2010-12-18T23:33Z,"@dr23

The same thing happened to me, I don't know if the readme just wasn't specific enough about which folder to actually paste it to, or what."
,accept-ted,2011-01-18T00:51Z,hey thanks for the download. do i need to make a battle.net account?
,gunshotkill,2011-06-10T12:58Z,"works good for me, just follow the instructions in the readme, and preferrably use daemon tools instead of the prepacked software"
