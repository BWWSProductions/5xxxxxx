,oithatguyoi,2010-10-26T23:41Z,AUDIO IS OUT OF SYNC... BUT VIDEO IS PRETTY GOOD FOR A CAM
,Jubbey,2010-10-27T00:25Z,"@oithatguyoi
That's going to annoy the shit out of me... I wonder if it's still worth the download"
,Jubbey,2010-10-27T00:32Z,"Wait, doesn't vlc have an audio lag correction or something?..

Yup, anyone experiencing audio lag with vlc player, goto tools>track synchronization
You'll figure it out from there"
,Maxxax,2010-10-27T00:50Z,"wow wait... how is this letterboxed? its a cam lol

anyway, downloading the sample atm, went to see this in the cinema today, does it have the ending were Katie comes and kills the 2 adults and takes the baby?"
,Maxxax,2010-10-27T01:05Z,"the sample looks good, audio seems good in sample. just sync it up in vlc"
,aphexes,2010-10-27T03:21Z,"wow, thanks alot Maxxax... way to ruin the film fopr everyone else."
,Kayotix,2010-10-27T08:50Z,I can't for the death of me find the right setting to Sync the audio  what did you guys use if you managed to get it right ?
,Maxxax,2010-10-27T16:25Z,"This is an open source illegal download site. expect things to be spoiled.

Also, you can just as easily read it on wikipedia."
,Crunox,2010-10-27T17:11Z,"@maxxax

WTF dude!? You ruined the movie... fucking dipshit."
,micro-sleeps,2010-10-27T17:34Z,"@Maxxax
What a dumbshit comment. Things are only ruined when wankers like you are around. What is your motivation for ruining the film for others? Are you always a miserable piece of shit, or do try your hardest when online?
Asshole."
,Maxxax,2010-10-27T18:00Z,"when i was in the cinema i noticed an ""extended"" ending and it wasnt on another download. so i asked. shouldnt've worder it like that but i was tired. it was 2:50am.

its still good, just forget about the comment and watch it. i only gave a basic info"
,renars132,2010-10-27T18:46Z,will comment on quality after dwnld.
,omar6000,2010-10-27T22:04Z,"@Jubbey I'm really confused at this whole VLC thing, so far I'm on -3100 ms and I think I've gone wrong, anyone know what the setting needs to be??"
,Jubbey,2010-10-28T00:28Z,"@omar6000
I had mine at +1.600s since the audio is behind the video, it has to be delayed. But it seems like the audio jumps forward and back at times, it would eventually un-sync. I suggest waiting for a copy with better audio"
,renars132,2010-10-28T01:30Z,"Audio - 6/7
Video - 7

Good quality audio, actually hearable. even if you do get the audio in sync it goes during the film, so when you get one bit synced up another bit will go, but atleast its the full film.

dunno why this is letterboxed tho, still good"
,MaxMouseG,2010-10-30T22:09Z,Someone get Maxxax banned he's retarded
,BryanD85,2010-10-31T07:06Z,Maxxax- You're inconsiderate. Take a second and think before you post. Most people don't like to read the ending of a movie before they watch it. Fortunately I figured out you're a dipshit before I read your entire post and averted spoiling the movie. I'm cautious when I read because of punk mother fuckers like yourself. I hope you contract AIDS and die.
,Dilzy,2010-10-31T16:01Z,"Bryan, don't hold back. Maxxass deserves that and more. He brags he went to the cinema to see this and deliberately spoils the ending on at least  uploads. He's one of those Anti Pirate wankers."
,r1chee,2010-11-06T06:20Z,@max you son of a bitch!!!!!!
,Hogzor,2010-11-09T04:49Z,"Why??? he is obviusly owning you fucking dumbass thepiratebay commenters for being retarded and falling for his trolly trixx.. all of you are seriusly so damn retarded taht you but a new clash to retardness... i mean seriusly, aphaxxes, MaxMouseG, BryanD85, R1Chee etc etc, you are obviusly teh ones taht are most retarded.. so im happy for trolls like maxx in this case.. cuz i guess idiots like u need ot learn it the hard way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,kennethmilsom,2010-11-09T07:15Z,Iv seen this one.At the end of the movie you will see all these names come up.
,imsharing,2010-11-18T04:25Z,lol ooooh wow max said the ending lol big m.f. deal...
,damienisxcore,2010-12-20T00:05Z,"Stop arguing on the internet. That's all I see on TPB nowdays. I feel like it's turning into another YouTube where people just flame eachother. Grow up. 

It's your faults for not stopping when reading ""does it have the ending were Katie"".

Seriously, why would you continue reading if you didn't want it spoiled? Idiots.."
,teeth09,2011-01-09T09:26Z,"@Maxxax
you ass maggot you ruined it."
