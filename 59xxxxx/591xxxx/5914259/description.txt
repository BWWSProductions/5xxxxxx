This set contains all the available versions of the propaganda movie "9|11" by the Naudet Brothers.

1) a VHS recording of the first time the movie was aired by CBS in 2002;
2) the DVD version;
3) the 2006 "revised" version, with some extra content on the side.

Included are rough clips of the 1st and 2nd hits from the three versions, that can be perhaps usefully compared for differences in audio or video.
