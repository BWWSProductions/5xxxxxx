Thank You!"
,wickedpringles1989,2010-11-26T08:33Z,"Great torrent, btw.  Only thing it's missing is a nice readme with the description of each app."
,Fotrast144,2010-12-06T23:05Z,yeah great upload!!
,Darklord1990,2010-12-13T10:01Z,"This is a really awesome upload. Thanks for all the OCRs. Also, I didn't know of quite a few apps which are really useful! Thanks a lot!"

,TruPinoyFNG,2011-01-04T10:19Z,"Hey! Great torrent! Downloaded it last night and overall happy. But some apps require product registration that you did not provide. Folx comes with a reg number and name but it was incorrect. Drive Genius 3 is also only a demo. So is iStat Menus, AppZapper, iMind Map, Cocktail, Xtorrent, and Transmit. Those are all product demos and will expire soon and I did not see any files regarding their serial keys. Would you be able to help on this?"
,Darklord1990,2011-01-13T10:37Z,"I agree with TruPinoyFNG.
I have the same problem.
Can you please provide any files regarding their serial keys or point to where we can get them? I really like iMindMap and would like to use it a bit more.
Thanks."
,Darklord1990,2011-01-17T06:06Z,"A solution to the problem is the following:
Please right-click Buzan's iMindMap V4.app and click 'show package contents'
Navigate to Contents/Resources/Java/lib
Please replace 'Protection.jar' with the one provided in the torrent.
Hope this helps!"

,mac_user777,2011-04-11T06:08Z,"Mac Users beware of installing Parallels, it can create a false ethernet IP and disrupting your wireless,so you continually have Self Assigned IP problems,I had to use terminal and go deep just to remove software from parallels when i discovered what it was doing.Caused me trouble no end you better using Bandcamp or finding native versions of programs trust me,parallels just isn't worth it.If your reading this and you haven't had an issue well good for you but warning others if you have problems with wireless consider removing all of parallels,find the terminal commands on the net."
,flaudus,2011-08-17T17:08Z,Hello all-Thanks for all the work-I found another uncracked application-Xtorrent is not cracked-You still have to have a activation number for it work.
