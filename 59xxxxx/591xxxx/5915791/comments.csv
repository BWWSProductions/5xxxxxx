Lots of people trying to download these collections and then finding they are only 70%, 80%, 99% 
:-(
But, a big thank you to rocketronniederman for the sheer effort this must have taken, some real gems in the material I have been able to download."
,rocketronniederman,2010-11-20T15:03Z,"Totally unaware that anything was wrong and I am addressing the problem as we speak ! I've reseeded some of the offending uploads, but I am at a loss as to why they are showing only 98.23% when others, uploaded in exactly the same way are showing 100%. Any help would be useful and appreciated."
,rocketronniederman,2010-11-21T02:34Z,"I've found out what was wrong, the torrent files weren't write protected and were altered when played, thus causing hash failures, or so I've been told !!!!"
,imunionjack,2011-03-06T01:01Z,Might as well just download my torrents as 90% are on  them
