"Conspiracy Theories and Soft Defenses"

When Dean Pelton (Jim Rash) begins checking 
class schedules, he discovers that Jeff 
(Joel McHale) has listed a class that 
doesn't exist. Just when it appears Jeff 
will be caught in a lie, the mysterious 
"Professor Professorson" (Kevin Corrigan 
"The Departed") emerges from the shadows to 
confirm that Jeff has been taking his 
class, "Conspiracy Theories in U.S. 
History," at night school. When Jeff later 
admits to Annie (Alison Brie) that he's 
never seen Professor Professorson in his 
life, the two decide to find out who the 
professor really is. Meanwhile, Abed (Danny 
Pudi) and Troy (Donald Glover) are busy 
building the most elaborate blanket fort 
that Greendale Community College has ever 
seen.

Enjoy :)
