Runtime...........:1h 55mn
Language..........:ENGLISH

IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO: Social Network R5 DVD9 ..............Thanks
AUDIO: Social Network studio ...............Thanks

Right first off... this is one of the worse r5's we've seen. It was way too dark, colours well off, lifeless, video noise etc... So first thing was to clean it up the best we could and it's came out alot better but still for compared too alot of r5's in our opinion. Now the audio was good ...it just needed shrinking to match runtime and then some fine tunning :)

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
