Lloyd Banks originally stated that his album was called The Hunger for More 2 by using twitter. It was unknown whether the album name was official or not. The title of the album was later confirmed by 50 Cent in a interview with MTV News. The album was thought to be possibly released under Interscope, by a new contract of the label and the rapper; also the Interscope chairman Jimmy Iovine revealed that he wants to sign the rapper to Interscope again, and he asked label mate 50 Cent \"what can I do to sign Lloyd Banks again?\". Banks has said that he is willing to re-sign, but only if Interscope is willing to issue an apology for \"doubting him.\" On August 13, 2010
