"Dash, Flash, Crash"

Everyone is gathering at a restaurant to 
celebrate Manny's birthday, though Manny 
himself is experiencing a mini-life crisis 
about getting older. Meanwhile, on the way to 
the restaurant, Phil and Claire decide to 
engage in a not-so-friendly car race there, 
and Mitch and Cam get sidetracked when they 
stop at the mall to pick up a gift.

Enjoy :)
