In the proto-typical Scandinavian ECM style of modern jazz oriented music,
pianist Tord Gustavsen follows the path of previous progenitors influenced by
Bill Evans, forged by Keith Jarrett, and extended by the likes of Mike
Nock. This is certainly late-night, nocturnal music, completely reserved and
relaxing, ultra-melodic, calm, peaceful, and non-threatening. Rarely does a
tempo move beyond medium, a dynamic merge above mezzo piano, and any mood goes
farther than moderately cool. Well within this consistent timbre, Gustavsen and
his trio show a modicum of diversity and influences. Fellow ECM labelmate Bobo
Stenson's style and technique is most extant during the lilting "Edges of
Happiness," "Twins" is spiritual, calm, and light but not somber, while "Token
of Tango" is perfectly representative of its title. "Curtains Aside" mixes march
rhythm in 6/8 with a regal light funk, the delicate waltz "Being There" is
reminiscent of "The Shadow of Your Smile," while darker ballads "Colours of
Mercy" and "Sentiment" sport undoubtedly religious overtones. Gustavsen, while
playing laid-back, pristine, pretty, and serene music, is far from challenging
convention or pushing the envelope. Conversely, his personal voice is fully
realized. Time will tell whether this style finds a worldwide audience, moves
away from this type of contemporary texture music, or takes the approach he has
established to any more extreme measures, even softer or more forceful.
