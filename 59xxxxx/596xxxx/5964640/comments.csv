,EA872,2010-11-20T00:54Z,"Im having trouble finding a serial code to use.. I ran the files directly without copying to a DVD since I have no DVDs that can hold more than 4.7G, and it went just fine until I had to activate the product. I checked the ""Crack"" Folder but it's empty, and no other serial number is given. Help please? =D"
,EA872,2010-11-22T03:50Z,"@ Dunge
Thanks for that. I did follow the instructions though.. I clicked cancel the first time, and it installed. But to actually play the game, it does need to have a serial, which is where the Crack comes in. Trouble is, the folder labeled ""Crack"" is..empty. Probably just gonna download a different one which is split into two sections to fit DVDs, which I should have done from the start, heh. 
And yeah its funny when things work like magic suddenly."
,MoonGeese,2010-11-29T20:55Z,"@EA872
It's possible that your anti-virus believes that the crack-file is a virus, and therefore deleted it. It has happened to me several times before."
,laggerish,2010-12-11T11:06Z,"Awesome! The best Need for Speed gameplay ever! 
And also a great fast upload! However the Activator doesn't work. I used another crack.
