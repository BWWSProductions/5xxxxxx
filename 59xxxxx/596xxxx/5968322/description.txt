[Spraff]

Critically acclaimed BAFTA-winning star of BBC One's 
Not Going Out and Would I Lie To You? Returns to the 
live stage with a hotly anticipated new show. Lee 
brings his trademark brand of high energy banter, well 
crafted gags and sharp one-liners to venues across the 
country in his national sell-out live show, Going Out - Live.
