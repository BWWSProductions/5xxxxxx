Don Henley - Inside Job  H.264 .m4v/.mp4

Judging from the number of downloads o shows that I've packaged into  H.264 MP4's, there appears to be a large demand for these shows in a modern video container.  AVI's have become obsolete. 

However, to support these and future downloads I ask YOU KEEP SEEDING after your download is complete.  I suggest you set a minimum UL speed of 30 kB/s by right clicking on the torrent in your Bittorrent client and adjusting the Bandwidth Allocation.  This will free up my bandwidth for new torrent uploads.  THANKS!

I took VIDEO TS files of each of the two DVD's and ripped H.264 MP4 files of each movie.  I deliberately kept the file size large as to not suffer with blocky chunks of pixelation in the black backgrounds of the concert.
  The files have a suffix of .m4v as they were ripped using HandBrake 0.9.4 so they can be played on any current iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or in iTunes.  They can also be played on any compliant player but you may need to change the suffix from .m4v to .mp4.

A note about the audio:

The videos indicate a separate channel with Dolby Digital 5.1 when you "Get Info" using iTunes. For a better explanation of this go to:

The second and third paragraphs apply to these rips. But as I understand it, all the suffixes must remain .m4v.

All I really know is I get 5.1 surround sound when I play on my 1st Gen Apple TV

Don Henley - Inside Job  (2000)

After his career ended with The Eagles in 1980, Don Henley began a successful solo career, releasing albums sporadically over the next 20 years. From his debut "I Can't Stand Still" to his latest album "Inside Job," Henley has shown that in an age of teen pop and alternative metal, old-fashioned rock and roll is still alive and kicking. Image Entertainment has released this live concert recorded in Texas from his "Inside Job" tour on DVD.

This live "remarkable" (so speaketh the DVD packaging) concert was filmed at Fair Park Music Hall in Dallas, Texas, during Henley's newest tour. It looks like a nice area to play in, though the curtained backdrop looks like something Stevie Nicks discarded from her wardrobe back in 1987. Henley, sporting a Priest-like shirt and a hairstyle that looks as if he's been licking light sockets, appears somewhat stiff onstage, but we're not watching to see him to do the truffle-shuffle. We're here for the music.

Also included in the beginning of this concert is a quick-edit interview of Henley's thoughts onâ€¦well, everything. He chats about his family and what he's been doing, what he thinks of his music, and what it's like to be onstage in front of an audience. The DVD includes the songs:

â€¢ Dirty Laundry
â€¢ Sunset Grill
â€¢ Workin' It
â€¢ Taking You Home
â€¢ The Boys Of Summer
â€¢ Lilah
â€¢ Everything is Different Now
â€¢ The End Of The Innocence
â€¢ All She Wants To Do Is Dance
â€¢ New York Minute
â€¢ Talking To The Moon
â€¢ They're Not Here, They're Not Coming
â€¢ The Heart Of The Matter
â€¢ Desperado
â€¢ The Long Run
â€¢ My Thanksgiving
â€¢ Hotel California

Don Henley: Live Inside Job is presented in it's original 4:3 full frame aspect ratio, and for a concert recording looks remarkably clear. The picture shows no signs of digital artifacts or shimmer, and the colors are bright with no bleeding. Blacks were solid, and for what this is (a concert show) the image is very strong. A very good job by the people over at Image Entertainment.  Audio is the strongpoint of the DVD package.
