This work covers the advanced topics in main ideas of computing in
general. This material is approved in practice of NRNU MEPhI, MIPT and
several other educational centers of the Russian Federation.
Its 1st part represents an outlook of computations, which is achieved
by adoption of the atomic doctrine for specified reference system of primary
objects. The main attention is given to finding-out of technological features
of computations with objects. Their interaction is considered in applicative
environment that allows finding out internal structure of usual operations
which knowledge allows understanding their properties. The choice of initial
constant entities, considered as primary and referred as combinators is
discussed. These initial entities are used as the basic â€œbuilding blocksâ€,
entering in applicative environment in interaction with each other. This
interaction results in the constructs, giving representative sets of usual
operators and to the embedded computing systems.
The 2nd part gives some supply of environments for educational and
methodical complex of corresponding discipline (EMCD).
This material is suitable both for advanced learners and beginners in
Computing and Information Technologies as well as in Discrete Mathematics
(DM) and Fundamental Basics of Information Technologies (FBIT). It helps
for developing the intuition sufficient for successful navigation across the
dramatically changing world of innovative information processes which occurs
both in nature and technology.
Material is especially useful for the instructor, postgraduate and graduate
students of IT-specialties and is suitable for the system of training and
advancing the qualification of specialists.
