,cryskonig,2011-01-16T00:38Z,"I use a copy of ""ConvertXtoDVD"" that I found on here. You just select the file and convert. It stays in the original format."
,vinax522,2011-01-20T16:42Z,"@dabs139

ey! you can use any dvd ripper. there is an option to what output format you want say .avi, .mpeg, etc... accompanied by the size of frame you want say widescreen at 1280 x 800, etc..."

,PR3CiSiON,2011-02-18T03:24Z,"Hey my internet server picked up that I downloaded this, even with a proxy. Most other videos they dont get tho. watch out, they finally catchin up with us pirates."
,maiacroky,2011-02-27T17:21Z,"""next time make it work on ps3 no sound wtf.. ""

Maybe the PS3 should be updated to work with regular video files ... wtf !

But really, there are some really stupid people. They contribute nothing, they download as they wish and then still complain about compatibility with their nifty platform ... Pathetic ..."
,Daky101,2011-06-06T09:01Z,Thx!
