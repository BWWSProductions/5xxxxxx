Debby Ryan (Disneys The Suite Life on Deck) stars with Jean-Luc Bilodeau (Kyle XY) in this spellbinding comedy about what happens when your most outrageous wishesâ€¦come outrageously true! Abby Jensen has been dreaming about her â€œsweet 16â€ since she was a little girlâ€¦but it starts out anything but sweet. Then she receives a box of mysteriously magical birthday candles. And suddenly, AbbyÃ¢Â€â„¢s every wish is instantly granted: the cherry-red sports car, the way-cool clothes, the uber-popularity at school. But when Abby makes a wish that turns her perfect new life totally upside down, she and her best friend Jay have just one chance to make things right â€“ and to learn you have to be careful what you wish forâ€¦really, really careful!
