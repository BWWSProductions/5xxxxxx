Riese is the Crown Princess of Eleysia, forced to flee into the wilds after her family
was slaughtered. She will soon serve as a catalyst for a disparate group of supposed heretics,
the Resistance,launching them into civil war.

Riese (Christine Chatelain), a wanderer, travels across the decaying lands of Eleysia 
with her wolf, Fenrir. Marked as a heretic by religious group The Sect and the new 
Empress, Amara, Riese must evade their assassins and discover their true intentions for Eleysia.

Eleysia is a dying kingdom where resources are dwindling and compassion is fading. 
Distrust and anxiety have clouded peopleâ€™s minds, causing a regression into primitive 
ways of thinking. People have grown restless, almost feral. Rituals and mythology have 
resurged, and the darker side of mankind has begun to reveal itself.
