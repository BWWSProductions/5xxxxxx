Dr. Fell's Cabinet of Smells

From BBC Radio 7. Written by Susan Gates; Read by Jonathan Bailey. Abridged.


Meet Juniper, a girl with no smell prejudice - she even likes sniffing Kit's armpits! Using an E-nose (the latest in smell technology) she duplicates people whose essences were in an old cabinet, among them an evil doctor whose nose keeps falling off. Can the children foil his plans?
