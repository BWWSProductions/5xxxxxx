Boomshakalaka! EA Sports NBA Jam revives the classic franchise with
vintage NBA Jam gameplay, all-new features, and, for the first time

play. Shoves, spins and, of course, backboard smashing dunks take center
stage with Classic 2 vs. 2 gameplay that lies at the core of NBA Jam.
Play with a roster of current NBA players, NBA legends and a few special
appearances on the hardwood.

For the first time ever play the arcade classic online. Gamers can take
on all rivals playing Classic 2-on-2 online, measuring their success on
Friends and Global Leaderboards. Connected fans will be able to team-up
locally to compete online in Remix Games, including Backboard Smash,
Domination Free-for-All, Elimination, and 21. Fans will also be able to
make it a Jam Party online by inviting up to 3 friends on separate
consoles to play. Plus, gamers will be able to take on the world in
Online Progression, leveling up through a series of challengers and
secret online JAM Challenges to unlock online exclusive rewards and
hidden content in the ultimate quest for global bragging rights.
