The second volume begins with a depiction of the events leading up to the wedding chapel massacre. The Bride is at her wedding rehearsal, along with her groom-to-be, Tommy Plympton (Chris Nelson), and a number of others. Bill arrives at the chapel, much to The Brideâ€™s surprise (with her asking: â€œHow did you find me?â€). Through the ensuing conversation it transpires that The Bride has decided to leave the life of an assassin (as well as Bill, her former lover), in order to settle down with her as-yet unborn daughter and soon-to-be husband. Shortly after this conversation, the Deadly Vipers enter the chapel (at the behest of Bill), opening fire on those assembled inside.
