,S!R3,2011-04-10T03:14Z,"The audio was weird, and so was the aspect ratio.. Your up of vol 1 was great though, but I would go with another rip for vol 2."
,elcapizzo,2011-04-13T04:45Z,Aspect ratio and audio fine for me.. playing on a 19:10 screen and VLC.
,elcapizzo,2011-04-13T04:47Z,416x720 resolution
,jkeller80,2011-07-15T23:51Z,"Agreed on the aspect ratio.  The same settings weren't used to rip both.  Probably did them on different days and one got default settings as opposed to optimal.  

A for effort but I'll pass on #2."
