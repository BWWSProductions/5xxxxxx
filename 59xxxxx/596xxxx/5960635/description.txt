Jenn's guitar style really stands out. She combines all aspects of her musical upraising -- from folk to jazz. Jenn doesn't use picks, she uses her fingers -- "giving a warmer, softer tone" -- and one I find to be a bit deeper, more meaningful in its sound. It is obvious she has a deep and abiding love for music, it carries across to the listener in every note, every nuance. This is great music!
