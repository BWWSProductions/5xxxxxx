4/10 Biggest disappointment of the year."

,skullos,2010-12-23T10:35Z,"@tronsolo The difference between the wii version and the ps3 version is huge. I've got both and I must say that NFS Hot Pursuit on the PS is the best NFS since the beginning. This version was just handed to another company with the words: ""Make something from it and put our name on the box, it will sell anyway."""

somithing or whatever? ^^"
,flakmoppe,2011-06-24T10:26Z,"r1ntse: I don't now if it will work that easy (but i hope so, for your sake).
Otherwise i recommend buying a usb-hdd and softmodding it :)
