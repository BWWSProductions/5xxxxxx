Star showed up in our dungeon with this assumption that suffering would earn her something. We do not know if she was expecting brownie points or a pat on the back but whatever it was she was definitely mistaken. Suffering is not some kind of currency that you trade in for favors. When Cyd Black wants to make her cry it will not be as some sort of foreplay for a romantic evening. It is a cold and well rehearsed dance to him.
