dank je voor je hulp vanuit Thailand...."
,importford,2010-11-18T22:16Z,"thanks delicious,
it worked perfect.
I cleaned everything and my computer is running much faster now,
Delicious, an other question,
I noticed that registry booster has an other program that i can download: ""driverscanner""
This will scan and update my drivers.
If I download this, will it run with the serial keys that you gave me?

,some-young-guy,2010-11-20T07:30Z,"I just installed Vista SP2 and it (unbeknown to me) formatted my drive on me.  after reinstalling all my torrents, I come to find the Device Manager and other Snap-In based features are blocked by MMC.  this is a registry issue that and I cannot figure which file to alter, and what the end value is to be.  Is there a tool that will do all that for me, or do I need to reboot the entire system again and install each torrent very carefully?

This is not an attempt to hijack a torrent thread, just am at whits end."
