,subestrenos9,2010-12-28T13:54Z,"COMMENT TO THE UPLOADER:

This is a crapy upload. Why do you use dual audio JAPANESE / ENGLISH?
Do you really think someone is interested in Japanese? Come on!! They probably have their own download sites.
There are about 10 million Japanese and more than 1 billion people that speak English in this world!

It took my several hours to convert this stupid .ogm file format to .avi format with only the English voices. I used ""Super 2010 conversion tool"" (freeware). 
Nevertheless I think you should offer ready to use things and not stuff that causes the user some extra effort. Think about the user as customer!! Do it good, do it right next time!"

Don't blame the uploader if you dont know how to watch it, its not that hard to figure out. try Media player classic or VLC will play most files no problem. some of us like to watch anime in japanese as well as english. (usually its better). maybe you should learn the ropes before complaining about how its done.

tehlastblade - thanks for the upload. great copy! keep it up"

A lot of English speaking people prefer to watch anime subbed, mostly because the dubs are often low-quality and cheesy. Why did you need to convert it to .avi, and not just watch the .ogm with your player set to default to the English track? You did not need to convert anything.

Also, nobody owes you anything, I'm just reseeding this torrent, it is not my release. Why don't you upload a torrent with your fresh .avi files if you think anybody needs it? "
