,fakebest,2010-11-18T04:31Z,I am seeding this regardless of what the stats say I know it says zero seeders but I am seeding this and will be for a long time.
,wroth91,2010-12-22T02:44Z,"truthfully I'd rather have the iso files, but since I can't find all of them properly seeded I'll see what I can do with this ;p thanks ^..^ and I would love to see vol 7 when u can"
,fakebest,2010-12-27T23:18Z,"@wroth91 I got all the iso's from here and that is how these were made and they are still here and seeded http://thepiratebay.org/user/vodkajcl/ the earlier volumes don't have tags so that is why they don't come up in the search.  I dont understand why you want the iso's they are way bigger and less user friendly. These encodes are dvd quality with h.264 codec you can still burn these to dis if you want and nothing is missing from iso's except the main menu, trailers, and other useless stuff.  all episodes are intact in one file per volume."
,Dracamus,2011-07-05T04:14Z,do you have vol 7 or 8 yet?
,fakebest,2011-10-15T12:32Z,@Dracamus if thepiratebay has it then I will too but I just searched and this torrent is the most recent so hopefully someone uploads the new volumes and I will make mini versions of them
,Dajuggalo,2011-10-21T16:58Z,Doesnt work..i downloaded and it says no files are there
,fakebest,2011-12-13T15:33Z,"@Dajuggalo so I guess you have some sort of advanced operating system that talks to you in layman's terms.  It told you something doesn't work and nothing was there?  You are such a moron... First of all the torrent works, secondly there are six files that it will make into a folder and they are .mkv which require vlc or media player classic to play or whatever other video player capable of such a format.  If your too dumb to figure any of this out, such as torrenting or playing videos then you should not be commenting and you should be googling."
,fakebest,2011-12-13T15:38Z,too all if you need seeders let me know at thefakebest@live.com this email is only for communication of torrents so all other messages are ignored
,tommytomthms5,2012-01-11T10:32Z,Thanks! :) and I think I'll be better off buying volumes 7+ just out of support for the show :D
,vodkajcl,2012-05-08T14:59Z,"I have been meaning to buy the next few volumes and get them uploaded, but I guess time has gotten away from me. Never Fear though, I will eventurally do it, I just can't say when....."
