Date: August 30,1996
Venue: Rose Garden
=====================================================

Recording: AUD

=====================================================

Comments: One camera stage left. Shaky and with focus problems. 
There's also some tape interference and warbling. 
Just about every single song has cuts or audio dropouts so 
although all the songs are there this is a very partial show.
Audio is distant and muffled.
