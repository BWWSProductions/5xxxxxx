Loreena McKennitt goes back to the traditional Celtic and English folk music that launched her career with the release of The Wind That Shakes the Barley  on November 16 via her own Quinlan Road label. An international, Grammy-winning success story who has sold nearly fifteen million albums worldwide (including five million in the U.S.), McKennitt has expanded her original Celtic harp-focused sound to include a variety of world music styles, most notably the Spanish Basque and rhythmic middle eastern music influences.

The Wind That Shakes the Barley, recorded at the historic 1832 Sharon Temple outside of Toronto, finds the multi-instrumentalist McKennitt in a slightly more spare folk setting than her more recent expansively produced works. There's a certain fragility at the heart of Barley's most tender ballads -- "On a Bright May Morning", "The Parting Glass" -- an intimacy that extends throughout what is easily one of McKennitt's most personal albums. "Every once and again there is a pull to return to one's own roots or beginnings," says McKennitt, "with the perspective of time and experience, to feel the familiar things you once loved and love still."
