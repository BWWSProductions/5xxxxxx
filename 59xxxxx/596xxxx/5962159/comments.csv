My dear peater...

Is that so....
Then you should ask your money back! I do feel strongly about this, it's your right!

and

If you like the music from Loreena McKennitt, you should buy the CD to support the artist.

But since yourself never shared anything with others (Your search did not match any torrents.)
you are one of the persons if they get anything for free, they still ask for a discount...

,skymning84,2010-11-19T14:47Z,Same problem as peater. 
,peater,2010-11-19T15:56Z,"If all uploads were as crappy as this one, i'd rather see tpb go under :-) "
,mhack_52,2010-12-30T13:37Z,I really wish someone would post this as a FLAC download.  How about it?
,vandergraaf1000,2011-02-24T19:50Z,Dont know what the problem is with peater but I just downed it (In about 45 secs!!) and all tracks are fine! Many thanks reichert and as usual with Loreenas music I WILL be buying the CD!
,bychance,2011-03-13T09:28Z,"vandergraaf1000, your making me jealous with your download speed, it took me over 16
 minutes. Burned to CD using Nero Burning ROM v10.5 (thanks ChattChitto RG. ). Plays
 back perfect. Good job reichert, you have my vote for a pink skull for this one.
