,Pliskin.s,2010-11-17T00:08Z,"I Never tried a PS3 game torrent ,could you recommend the hardware and software needed to get these to work,I would appreciate it greatly.

I'm experienced with PC game torrents only.

Thanks if anyone bothers to help a guy out."
,Krock0,2010-11-17T00:59Z,Works? Or not?
,Tevynn,2010-11-17T14:07Z,"Thanks for uploading mate!
Unfortunately im getting this error:
(80029567) when installing the update.. :/
I got an original PSJailbreak dongle, you know whatÂ´s wrong?
Thanks!"
,Kevin925,2010-11-17T22:28Z,"@Tevyn. Make sure you have the most recent payloads. Since this game is new, it may even be manufactured with Sony's 3.50 SDK, in which case we'd all be screwed. 

Make sure you try both patching the PSRAM file, or try getting a payload that spoofs your fw to 3.50."
,carbine7,2010-11-18T01:23Z,"Looked at the files, looks legit enough..... gonna take a while, but I'll report if it works.

@pliskin.s: try ps3hax.com, they have lots of good info for beginners"
,Krock0,2010-11-20T01:39Z,"Attention ! You may lose your PS3 playing this one.Freeze, then  big problems. Recovery menu as save me. Ouff ! "
,carbine7,2010-11-20T10:12Z,"I get that same error code too, making this unloadable. The issue is with the ATAX update .pkg file, not the game."
,supertommie,2010-11-23T17:43Z,"Hello,

,supertommie,2010-11-27T14:59Z,I installed a other patch and it worked but now i am getting error 8001003E No disk insert assassins creed brotherhood :S i dont know what to do
,Esto123,2010-12-04T09:40Z,where i can find pc version ? 
,mevel_x,2010-12-07T16:26Z,''Zemerdas'' same thing has happen to me as well! my system was freezing every time i started my ps3 and recovery did not work for me:( But i managed to fix the problem by removing my ''hdd'' from the ps3 and formatting it on my PC!! Guys the game will work on ur ps3 with no sound for few minutes then it will freeze on u! then u reboot ur ps3 by force it will freeze on the start menu!!! so make sure u backup all of ur data on a 'USB' before trying this game!! Cheers:)
,radical-d,2010-12-10T16:28Z,"i have been using the pirate bay for years and noticed no good solid comments or explanation, so time to give back a little...

firstly... backup all your PS save fies just incase anything goes wrong( but it wont ^^)


1.upload the game to the new directory in which ever manager you prefer(i used om2.1) and forget about the separate ATAX directory, so just install the game in the new directory BLES-00909 .

2. restart ps3 jailbroken etc. and start up FTP and head over to brewology and search for the 2.01 update for AC-brotherhood and download to ps3


3. restart ps3 and install update


4. open manager of choice and make sure to check ' disk needed ' 

5. launch game and make sure to start up from whatever disc u have inserted


6. Walla the game starts up properly and it will begin installing some data to the hd (over 3000mb so about 10 mins)

7. your gd to go ^_~

,joskobalboa,2010-12-20T13:31Z,"WORKS PERFECT!
Great Torrent!
I jailbroke my ps3 with my iphone 3g, used the PL3 payload, that is compatible with GAIA manager. Transfered the game via ftp to my internal ps3 hdd in the folder BDRIPS. Then i ran the updatefile via usb and was ready to play. My first JB game that i have tried. No lagg everything works, better than I expected =)"
,sonoreo,2010-12-25T11:58Z,"Question: In order to play this game you need to have it on a disc so that you can slide it into the PS3, and since I am a bit of a noob at these things, do need a special disc, BluRay perhaps? Not sure, if someone could help me out, that would be great. "
,Omis_oz,2010-12-26T11:14Z,"This game works. Steps I did =>

(1) Ftp's files over to PS3 
(2) named the directory BLES-00909
(3) Installed the pkg file included under Ajax directory fro usb stick.
(4) Ran the game via the disk, with another different ORIGINAL in the drive with gaia.
(5) Could not really work out where to get the 2.01 patch or how to apply... but for single offline play, this is not needed.

Cheers."

- Hope you are on Some Custom Firmware i.e. Waninkoko / Kmeaw / There are many now of 3.55. If not, get to that.
- Just DL this thing
- UnRAR it
- Put it on ur External HDD
- Connect HDD to ur PS3
- Start Rogero / Multiman any backup manager u use. 
- Play ze game !! 

Works fine, Thanks a ton to the ULer"

Follow the steps given by the Uploader- IT WORKS

1- Copy the game to ps3 Internal Disk
2- install the update ATAX-ASCB-UPDATE.pkg
3- On you manager - activate the option "" DISC NEEDED"", put on YES
4 - Insert a Original game disk
5 - run the game

Some people on this forum says that it is not necessary to install the update, could be, but I use Om 2.1 I, and it was necessary to do it, on other software don't know.
