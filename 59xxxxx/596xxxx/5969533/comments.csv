[V],prashant22,2010-11-20T11:42Z,"@jarman...
ya i will do abt 50% movies in 5.1 and 50% in stereo..."
,_Dux,2010-11-20T13:05Z,"V: 10
A: 10

About 5.1 - I myself don't have 5.1 speakers, but I'd say go for it IF it's no more than 60-70 MB!

Btw, I see that the size of this release is increased compared to your other ones (even if we subtract those 50 additional MB), but I'm sure it's because you increased the quality..."
[T],MitZep,2010-11-20T13:07Z,stereo is better as most people have stereo only those who have surround sound and lcd tvs dwload those big 4gb 8gb files to watch movies at this file size is gud for people lyk us who watch it on pc...
[V],prashant22,2010-11-20T13:30Z,"@dux & mitzep
i'll stick to stereo only  for most of the releases..i'll only use 5.1 for some nt every...

and Dux if u subtract those 50 if i say more specifically then 60...then the size would have been 650...which i was planning previously for this movie(with stereo)...
bt really u guys wont mind a 700mb file i think so..compared to a 4gb its still small..."

thanx for it
please do transformers-2.......please"
,DSIN,2010-11-20T13:49Z,"@prashant : i agree wid mitzep...  my bravia is equipped with 5.1 dolby digital .. & has 6 speakers setup... but i usually watch these small sized m720p on my pc monitor..& stereo is good for that..
for bravia... i go for kingdom releases/hdlite 720p or 1080p now .. 
u shld use 5.1 on few movies (highly rated)... do that on avatar... as it has nuthin but effects & sounds.. etc.. for others 2 channels stereo is fine... ;)"

,muthineni,2010-11-21T09:39Z,"yeah buddy.
tranformers 2 of pluto was nowhwhere near ur rips..
thats why i rarely download other than kickass or urself.
i skipped n thought ok but it was all blurry in few scenes. so much for 'pluto s very good rip' i think ill delete it n download urs again.
learnt my lession. never believe the asses that like anything given for free.
keep rockin"
,DSIN,2010-11-21T10:22Z,"@prashant : ur inception print rocked on my bravia... 5.1 was a good change.. ty XD
@animefann aka muthineni:so the pluto rip of tr2 which was encoded at 945k video bitrate was blurry... i don't buy that for a sec.. how large is ur screen anyways..?? 40""?? 
its the second time u r insulting another gr8 uploader's upload... if u r such a quality freak that u find small brrips blurry ...get kingdom releases...but i know u can't do that since u have such a low bandwidth connection :P
so either start respecting uploaders who giv u free movies instead of criticizing becuz noone gives a damn to wat u think of their upload .. & i don't think u even dloaded pluto's rip... giv us some screens & we might believe. . :D
p.s : don't bother commenting or the next time i won't be playing the nice guy... peace ^^"
[V],prashant22,2010-11-21T10:46Z,"@muthineni
buddy its always good to here that u like my work..
bt i hv a advice for u and i m giving it as a frnd...plz learn to respect other uploaders because they work as hard as i do or who knows may be more than me...u r nt a uploader bt i am so i know how much it takes to rip a single movie...its nt a joke really...
if u give respect u will automatically earn it...

@DSIN
thanks for the info..i knew it will work fine..

and dont know bt DSIN and muthineni i sence there is a cold war going on b/w u 2..plz stop it.."
,DSIN,2010-11-21T12:22Z,@prashant : no dude.. i don't like calling it cold war..its more of like he pisses me off with his insults to uploaders ..  i respect all the uploaders ... cuz i'll be one of u guys soon & i know its a lot of hardwork .. i hope he starts behaving now that u told him the same thing.. XD
,muthineni,2010-11-21T12:25Z,"@ prashanth and everyone
before more people get hurt i have to say that i did not mean to insult pluto . its just that i have been recommended that rip as his best rip by few others i dont even remember but it turned out blurry even at 1gig. so i was kind of getting back at the guys by saying they love anything they get for free. thats wat my comment meant.why so much confusion

An uploader is someone who is doing so much work into every encode for a movie for free and i surely respect that. downloading or not is our choice. i was frustated that i was already running out of space and now wasted a gig more.i also burnt my hands at ' the thin red line ' rip by other uploader who also came highly recommended.once again no offence to uploader .hey  he's doing it for free.

@dsin- buddy i know wat to expect from small size encodes. i have hundreds of them from scorp kickass goku. i love evry one of them.
950 bitrate .it should be good? well it isnt . how do u explain that? i have a 23 inch lg flatron moniter for desktop. im not attacking u but really explaining that encode did go wrong somewhere.someone else was unhappy with same too. peace brother."
,muthineni,2010-11-21T12:32Z,"@ prashanth
i hope i made myself clear.. i was unhappy with the followers not the uploader>>>
And trust me buddy i know wat i am talking about. no taking back anything i said. 

sorry if u felt offended anyhow. u r one of the best uploaders ive followed."
[V],prashant22,2010-11-21T13:06Z,"@muthineni
ok buddy i m nt geeting much into this...just one more thing to say idownload everyday 4-6gb of movie rip it to 700mb and delete that 4-6gb one...u can also delete that 1 gb...

u know for inception i downloaded 6.5gb version and due to no knowledge abt 5.1 for first time i made some silly mistakes and downloaded another 2gb just to take its 6ch audio...and i to have a 512kbps connection...

bt leave all that just enjoy my uploads...and DSIN and muthineni u guys better be frnds..i would love to see that..."
,DSIN,2010-11-21T13:09Z,"@muthineni : ok dude ... u made urself perfectly clear & iam sure u can justify why u called riddlerA a ""fag"" last time.. right ..anyways.. lets just try to keep our fingers in control :D "
,muthineni,2010-11-21T13:31Z,"@dsin
of course there is a reason for everything. but thats a different download mess like tr 2 n the frustration against him but nobody cares about my sob story. so

why dont we surprise prashanth by staying cool for a while. n good luck on the uploading. peace"

p.s to z-warrior perfect picture and sound thank you :)"
[V],prashant22,2010-11-22T12:48Z,"@attackedbullet 
if u dont know how to download then first u hv to download a torrent client like ""utorrent"" or ""bittorrent"" search on google and u'll find it...
install it and u r ready to begain..
download the torrent file from here...now drag the torrent file to ur client or right click on the torrent file go in open with choose utorrent or bittorrent...
select the destination where u want to save the file and click ok...ur downloading will start...

directors cut is usually the one with greater runtime then the theatrical version...

u dont need to add the subs if u have the subs just make sure that it has the same name as the other file(movie one) has..play with vlc or kn player and the subs will appear....

in this release of mine the subs name is nt the same as the file name so u rename it same as the file name(the mp4 file)...

now i need to know one thing from u badly...i use seetings so that my rips can work on ps3 bt i dont have ps3 so i dont know...so plz can u confirm and tell me that does my rips work on ps3..."
