,ro4eva,2011-02-13T05:08Z,"You're welcome by the way, it took me awhile to make proper subs for this film.

I made 2 versions (if one isn't synced try the other):

25fps version - http://subscene.com/english/The-Human-Centipede-First-Sequence/subtitle-395134.aspx

24fps version - http://subscene.com/english/The-Human-Centipede-First-Sequence/subtitle-395133.aspx"
,jimmychamp,2011-03-16T02:34Z,"hey ro4eva, is it possiable if you can take out the english parts and just have the foreign bits only?? "

,Mayuri,2011-04-14T02:19Z,"I don't care what other people here think about the movie... it totally rocked! Dieter Leser did a hell of a great job playing as Heiter. Great movie! I really enjoyed watching this movie when it was on direct TV on demand. I still have it on my download list.  The quality of this rip is good, however theirs no subtitles for the none English parts. I went to ro4eva's URLs to download the subtitles to find out  that some of the words are missing so it's unreliable."
,ro4eva,2011-04-14T19:00Z,"@ Mayuri

Where are there parts missing?  Nothing was not translated except for a couple of one-word sentences in Japanese which are repeatedly said over and over which were translated earlier in the movie."
,ro4eva,2011-04-14T21:06Z,"For anyone who cares,

I've decided to work on editing/fixing (spelling errors, grammar, timing, etc.) my subs because after taking a close look at them, I feel they need some more work.  It's gonna take me a few days.  I'll also make a version for only the foreign dialogue.  Once I'm done I'll post links again to the new subs."
,ro4eva,2011-05-02T22:04Z,Update - Subs should be done and available for DL by the latest the end of this week.  Unfortunately I was very sick for the past 2 weeks and couldn't do anything let alone editing/fixing/creating subs.  There's been A LOT of changes thus far to the subs and revision 2 will be almost unrecognizable compared to the subs currently available.
,ro4eva,2011-05-05T03:35Z,"New and much improved subs are finally completed.

There are 4 versions.  

If you're not sure which one to download, download #2 if you want full English & Foreign subs or #4 if you want just Foreign subs.

Version #1 and #3 have been created for users who have converted the film back to its native 24FPS framerate.
