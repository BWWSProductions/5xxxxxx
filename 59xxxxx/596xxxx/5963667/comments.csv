So I got the .aex file thats shaped like a little lego, and put it into the plug-in folder for both premiere and after effects, with the correct premiere and after effect plug-in file.

Now I can't find the file inside the program. I searched for neat video and noise and couldn't find it. What am I doing wrong?"
[V],DeGun,2010-11-20T01:23Z,"In case the Plugins don't show up in your lugins list
 Google for Microsoft's free Visual C++ Runtimes:

                                  vcredist 2005 sp1

                                         and

                                  vcredist 2008 sp1

Install these runtimes, reboot and rescan your plugs 

Still not working ? you miss something else ina same kind than above ."

,Yurimpala,2011-04-14T00:14Z,"First of all, thank you very much for the upload.

I have downloaded the DVD1.43 Josh, but when I try to extract the content, Winrar ask me a password. How can I get this password?"

,duttyghos,2011-06-03T16:03Z,Hey Degun.. I'm a fan.. Just wondering if the Neat video you posted for mac is the pro version and also the extra bits for download.. what exactly are those dlc files???. Thanks
,WENKERBOY,2011-06-16T09:47Z,After Effects Mac version Neat Image or Neat Video available? Can't seem to find it anywhere although it is a widely used program..
,Nchamow,2011-06-29T09:32Z,"I cant for the life of me get this to work. I really need neat video for final cut pro, does anyone know where to get a fully working version?"
,Hackerpcs,2011-07-08T04:38Z,"Hi DeGun, can you upload the VirtualDub version? It's very small (I think) and I can support seeding it.
Thanks in advance."
,jehhgo,2011-07-28T18:46Z,Hi DeGun. I couldn't find the Neat Video effect in Premiere Pro after I installed it. I tried installing the runtimes you suggested and still the same result. What else do I need to do?
,JayArgo,2011-09-21T02:36Z,"The VirtaulDub patch doesn't work, you're still limited to the demo mode of 30 minutes processing. Unless I've missed something..."
,GJSN7,2011-10-06T03:01Z,"Oh masters of cracking, please suport us with the NEAT VIDEO PRO for MAC on PREMIERE with serial, or cracked or patched. I cant find it anywhereelse!"
,Ozgur7,2011-10-13T21:07Z,"Hey a question? no matter i did i couldn't get this work on CS5.. is it Windows 7 64bit, Adobe CS5 compatible at all or am i just wasting time? Thnx"
,Muianescu,2011-10-26T23:24Z," For those having problem with the install.
First execute the program NeatPNSetup_ Demo_2.21.exe (the one coresponding with your editing software) in the default folder, then execute the patch Patch_NeatVideo_2.21_PN. exe, if it's unable to find the path by itself, then browse for C:\Program Files (x86)\ Neat Video for  Pinnacle Studio (I have Windows 7 x64 and Pinnacle 14 HD) where it will overwrite the file NeatVideoPN.dll.
   After this to be sure that Pinnacle will find the filter you must copy the NeatVideoPN.fex and NeatVideoPN.xml files from the Neat Video installation folder (typically, C:\Program Files (x86)\Neat Video for Pinnacle Studio\) into the \Plugins\RTFx\NeatVideo\ subfolder inside the Pinnacle Studio folder. If in the Pinnacle subfolders is not a NeatVideo folder you must create it and copy the two files inside this folder. For me it was working so I presume is a good one. Thanks for the upload, is a very rare program, the demo version is not worthing!"
,Muianescu,2011-10-27T20:42Z,"  The problem is with this one that is working only in demo or home mode, which mean is usable only on resolutions of maximum 1280x720, so is not working on HDV (1440x1080). I have applied the patch but I can only make half screen without noise, not very good situation."
,silentwarior,2011-11-09T23:42Z,"Hi DeGun
