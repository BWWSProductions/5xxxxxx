Prof. Stone teaches an ESL class at the local community college. Gigi comes after the first day to pick up the notes that she missed, but when Evan asks her some basic questions in Spanish, she just stares at him. It seems she doesn't speak Spanish at all, and just wanted to get an easy A by "relearning" English. Prof. Stone isn't going to allow this to happen on his watch, but there definitely IS a way for her to earn that A in his class. With a different kind of "oral" skill.
