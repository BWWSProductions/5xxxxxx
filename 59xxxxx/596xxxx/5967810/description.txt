In this episode, Stossel investigates the controversy over modern vs. organic foods, the use of modern agricultural and agribusiness food production technologies, the chemicals in our food, and whether we should be worried about genetically modified foods. Stossel also challenges the assumed notions about organic foods: that it's more environmentally friendly, that it produces a better, more sustainable, and cleaner product (not to mention better tasting). Does it really?

(Uploader's note: Not addressed is the idea that a hefty dose of plain fraud may exist in the organic/natural foods industry, where "green" marketing takes center-stage while the true nature of the product getting the organic or enviro-special labeling may not be much more than repackaged foodstuffs from mainstream supply chains.)
