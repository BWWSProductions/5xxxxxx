,peer8ship,2011-08-24T02:58Z,"typical hong-kung-phooey garbage, stupid impractical idiotic kicks, dumbass punching bags on legs for enemies, and of course the evil japanese who have a work ethic and a creative culture that dwarfs anything these cantonese imbeciles could ever hope to possibly match much less fathom. no mention of the stinking british empire who poisoned china with opium backed by their corrupt navy, then practically took hk by force...no mention of the idiot japanese who were played like a t00l by these manipulative brit/american white anglos. goaded (or even conspired) to attack pearl harbor to give those british-american assholes all the justification they needed to rescind their isolationist policies so that they would be looked upon as the liberators of mankind and not the aggressors who as we speak are establishing a military presence throughout all of asia, europe and the americas (NAU anybody?). pop quiz! what exactly did these idiot japs get in return? oh yes 2 fucking nukes up their ass and a promise that they'd get 1st dibs on some of the latest tech. i wonder what the mainland chinese and these singsong cantonese retard stooges were promised and in what form was that payment rendered. if u were paying attention, the answer should be obvious amirite.

tell you what ray.cc, u keep ur light love joy peace and all that shit, i'll take knowledge and wisdom..and strength...and resilience anyday of the week or month or year. okay u green monkey. back on topic..just another subpar hk script by an equally subpar people...bla bla *yawn* think i'll pass up on this garbage. never seen nothing worth reminiscing from these cantonese morons. FACT! don't need to see this crap (yes! these idiots are that predictable and this stupid theme will repeat indefinitely because they're just too stupid to do anything else). rating : 1/100. FAIL! (a 1 cos if u wasted your money on this garbage, that dvd would make a great coaster). :\

@mathx (yeah u retard) : CN = China. ZH = Mandarin (zhong-guo). u will notice that zhongguo is actually 'chinese' so there is no equivalent to ur singsong cantonese dialect since u cantonese-speaking idiots are chinese e.g., Mandarin - Ni Hao Ma, cantonese - nei ho ma, if u want to create a language code that is consistent with ZH then cantonese would have to be KT = cantonese (kwang-tong) think of a [K]un[T] and you'll remember this code for life. likewise Mandarin would have to be changed to PT = Pu-Tong. and no u can't use CA because that stands for CAnada where u cantonese hav been flooding to making a nuisance of urselves as usual."
