,DontPissMeOff,2011-10-08T16:41Z,"The newest MBL Suite downloaded as a trial from Red Giant website does work in Vegas 64 bit actually, but there is no key/serial that I could find.
If anyone could help I'd be forever grateful - I can't afford to buy this software. "
,LikUranus,2011-11-01T20:35Z,"Hey, ""information"" in English is not a countable noun.  Like water.  You don't say ""I have infos (informations)"".  You say ""I have info (or information)"".  Likewise, a folder would be called an info folder, not an infos folder, and not an info's folder.  

INFO FOLDER is correct."
,luminatx,2012-01-23T22:01Z,"It's a shame this doesn't work anymore.
I tried installing with internet off, used the serial provided, installed fine.
but when I go to open Premiere Pro CS5, I get can error message.
""Magic Bullet Looks is unauthorized - please register or re-install"""
,Synthesist,2012-06-03T22:43Z,"""...to record/steal your personal information. Makes me a tad paranoid ""

Says the guy stealing software."
