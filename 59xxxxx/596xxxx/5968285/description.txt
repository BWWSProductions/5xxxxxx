Tim Vine is here partners. Riding in on a sand storm of 
laughter. All puns blazing. Tell your kinsfolk. Youre about 
to be captured by a posse of jokes.

Star of BBC1 'Not Going Out' comes back to what he does 
cotton pickin best.

"No one else will give you as many gags for your money. Vine 
is superb, as clever as anything being done today"
Guardian

N.B. This is not a show about cowboys; its just a bloke 
doing a lot of jokes.
