Release Notes:
 
Alien Breed 3: Descent is the final explosive chapter in the Alien       
Breed series, and is a science fiction arcade-shooter with an epic       
story, swarms of highly intelligent alien enemies, high-impact weapons   
and stunning environments, developed using Epic Games' UnrealÂ« Engine    
3. Descend into hell and once again take control of the hero, Conrad,    
the shipÄºs Chief Engineer, in his last stand against the savage alien    
horde. While the doomed vessel, the Leopold, and the alien space craft   
plunge deeper into the planetÄºs atmosphere, with an icy ocean            
promising a watery grave, you have just hours to defy a grisly death     
and survive the alien onslaught for the final time. As you struggle      
deeper into the sinking alien ship, through the freezing waters          
flooding every corridor, the horrifying truth surrounding the            
existence of the Breed is finally uncovered! In addition to the          
thrilling conclusion to the single-player campaign and the relentless    
and competitive "Survivor" modes, the game offers action-packed,         
two-player online co-operative battle modes.
