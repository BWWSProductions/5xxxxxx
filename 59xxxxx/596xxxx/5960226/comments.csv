Depeche Mode Tour of the Universe - Live in Barcelona 1080p DTS
File size                        : 4.44 GiB

Read description. If you have no issues with playing back 1080p this will do.

The clips are 720p."

,01soccer,2011-04-13T16:44Z,"I'm having a real hard time making this work on my ps3. I can watch it on my computer with no trouble at all, but the damn thing just won't work on the ps3. Any ideas?"
,baltik33,2011-06-29T16:37Z,merci beaucoup
,SR4T9US,2011-12-16T02:57Z,"01soccer, It might be because it's DTS audio. Try demuxing to aac or some kind of mpeg. My issues were that i like to use a flashdrive in my tv, but DTS can't stream over USB. A converter called mkv2ac3 works great, it either adds ac3 audio or converts the DTS."
