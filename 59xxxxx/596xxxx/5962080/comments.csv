After the 11111-11111 code failed, I selected the Trial Code option and clicked next, got the error code and the following window had the option to Browse.  The key I entered only has 355 days left, so I got burnt for a day =("
,some-young-guy,2010-11-18T02:11Z,I think the key element to my success was being offline.  Had I been online it would've processed the 30 day trial Key and gave me that many days or less.
