PLOT:


Mac Mckussic (Gibson) is an unlikely drug dealer who wants to go straight. His old and best friend Nick Frescia (Russell) is now a cop who is assigned to investigate and bring him to justice. Mac is very attracted to Jo Ann(Pfeiffer), the owner of a stylish restaurant. Nick gets close to Jo Ann attempting to know more about Mac's drug dealing plans and his connections with the Mexican dealer Carlos(Julia), who the police believe is coming to town to meet with him. Nick also falls for Jo Ann's charms and his friendship with Mac is in danger.


Mac McKussic may have quit the business of drug dealing. But-inside and outside the law-the business won't quit him. In this high-gloss, high-stakes thriller Russel is Mac's pal Nick, a cop under pressure to bring Mac down. Pfieffer is a cool restauranteur torn between feeling for Nick and Mac and Julia plays a Mexican lawman with shady intentions.


TAGLINE:


A dangerous mix.   A business on the line. A friendship on the edge. A woman caught in the middle.
