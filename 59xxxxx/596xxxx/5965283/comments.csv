[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-14T05:26Z,@craqt - I can only suggest that you read a torrent's release notes before you post inaccurate comments in the future - you have also wasted your own time by not doing so.
,EvilCorporateWhore,2011-01-01T16:10Z,"Since HD-R-US has so many uploads, with little-to-no issues, i doubt this one has any either.

I haven't downloaded this one(yet), but the BTTF trilogy is probably my fave series of all time, right up there with the original Star Wars and Indiana Jones... so thanks for these."

sudo mount -o loop -t udf pathtobluray.iso /media/cdrom"
