Being saddled with a terrible supervisor can turn even the best job into a nightmare. Unfortunately, not every boss is the great symbol of managerial perfection one would hope for. In fact, more people than not consider themselves stuck with a "bad boss." But short of remaining miserable or quitting a job, what can be done about it?
A Survival Guide for Working with Bad Bosses provides readers with savvy, practical advice for coping with managers and supervisors who are mean, incompetent, unethical, and worse.
The book includes powerful strategies for not only working with -- but thriving under -- such bad boss types as:

* The Great Betrayers -- how to defend yourself against a corporate backstabber

* The Know-Nothing Bosses -- what to do when a boss is clueless

* The Bad Communicators -- how to respond when a boss is consistently unclear

Whether a boss is high-strung, incompetent, or a power-mad tyrant, this book has the solution...........
