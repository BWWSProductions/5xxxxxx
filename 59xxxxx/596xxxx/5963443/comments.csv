,gpcgamer98,2011-06-20T02:04Z,"yeah love the torrent, but i'd like to know if somebody can tell me how to put the game into my xbox360?"
,chrisdimi,2012-01-06T22:06Z,There has to be something wrong with the iso! I tried to unrar it to many places and it says that there is not enough disk space !!!!!! There is definitely something wrong because in the rar menu it has an arrow that indicates that a file is missing!! Anyone some problem?
,chrisdimi,2012-01-09T10:20Z,"Yeah I must have shit in my brain, although an engineer, my temp space c: had only 5Gb free so it didn't extract well!!
 Game works great!!"
