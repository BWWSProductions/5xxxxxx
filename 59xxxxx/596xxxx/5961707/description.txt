Okay we decided to use the spanish ts for video source its better then german source in some scenes was a little over colored so fixed that ran a denoiser few other flters

video is decent,Now on to audio our own and it is very good could pass for line just cleaned it up a bit and muxed with spanish ts.Also about an hour in the spanish TS was missing a scene for 6 seconds so we muxed our cam with it

All in all very watchable
