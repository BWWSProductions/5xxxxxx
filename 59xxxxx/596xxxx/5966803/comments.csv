,Stuntmanner,2011-05-24T19:38Z,"I wouldn't bother downloading. Just finished it, but I can't seem to find anywhere to install it. There's no .exe file nor is there anything to mount. (Tried unpacking everything without finding anything).

Some instructions would be neat. For now I'll just go with the 30 days trial and see if the crack at least will work."
,Stuntmanner,2011-05-24T19:42Z,Ooh I can't even extract the crack as some rars are missing -.-' It's sad.. I used to love this.
