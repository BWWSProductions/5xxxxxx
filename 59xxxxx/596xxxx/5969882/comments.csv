,RichterEX2,2011-08-13T05:39Z,Excellent quality! :D
,DeeJayVZ,2011-11-22T22:00Z,"Guys! Whatever rivalry there is between you, can you settle it off-public? I suspect 99% of the downloaders couldn't care less and most often don't appreciate the effort you have gone through to make movies like this accessible.

And on that bombshell...

Thanks for your work!!!"
,MOVNGFWD,2012-04-05T16:57Z,"Thanks, Bozx!  Always trust any torrent when ""BOYZ"" is on the title!  

jonny, life is way too serious in your world...!!!  Chill, buddy!  "
