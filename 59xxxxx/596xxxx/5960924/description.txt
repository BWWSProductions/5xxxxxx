In his new album, Slice, Ondrasik takes stories of friends, family and even American servicemen, and sets them to music. You can sense the passion he puts into each one of his songs.
Slice â€“ The title track, featuring Ondrasikâ€™s soaring falsetto, comes from a daydream that weâ€™ve all had at some point in our livesâ€”that moment when we long for a simpler time when life seemed better and the songs were bigger. Itâ€™s a sly play on one of those grand songs, Don McCleanâ€™s â€œAmerican Pieâ€: â€œThere was a time a long, long time ago/Chevies and levies played on the radio/No cell phones just 20,000 lights, swaying on a Saturday night.â€
