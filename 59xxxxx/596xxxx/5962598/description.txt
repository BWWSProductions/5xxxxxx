Not Just Pretty Faces; They Can Play, 27 February 2007 

This is different, and a nice treat for the eyes and the ears, particularly if you are a man who enjoys a pretty woman's face. "Bond" is a group of four attractive& Australian female violinists who are talented enough to give a performance at the prestigious Royal Albert Hall in London. This was filmed in a September, 2000, concert.

The girls play up their looks by wearing skimpy clothes, which is a little odd for violin and viola players, but who's complaining? One plays the cello, too. As colorful as the women and the sets are, the attraction is still what it should be: the music. These women may be young - and sound a bit immature when they talk, being nervous in their first big concert, but they can play!

I don't think this group ever recorded any followup concerts for DVD, and I'd like to see how they've progressed.
