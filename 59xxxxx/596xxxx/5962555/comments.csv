Full codex, no missig pages or problems, its all in colour and very good quality scans so each page is fully readable.

Giving this torrent a +1 on the quality tab.

Remember to seed and as always if you like the codex and plan to start a real dark eldar army buy the real codex as support the work that went into it."
