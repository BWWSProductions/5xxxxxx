The Dark Eldar are pure evil in its most sickening and elemental sense. Sadists and murderers all, they infest the hidden city of Commorragh, a hellish realm far from the eyes of mortal men. The Dark Eldar have steeped themselves in depravity for so long that they can only ensure their continual survival by inflicting pain and suffering upon the material dimension. Their lightning-fast terror attacks upon realspace are legendary, for the act of waging war gives them literal sustenance, prolonging their lives and filling their slender frames with stolen energies until they can move like quicksilver and shrug off bullet wounds with hollow laughter. Even their cold beauty hides a terrible internal ugliness, for Dark Eldar are utterly inhuman, eternally thirsting for the anguish of others so that they might temporarily fill the bottomless void they have in place of their souls.
