The encodes done by this guy before got fairly good reviews so is it any good?
Screens/smaple would also be nice! :)"

Go for it mate! Absolutely perrrrfect! Best thing I have seen so far!

Of course you have perfect ULers/RPers such as 3Li, HDLiTE, SM, IceBane, etc, but this is another category altogether. Not only because of the 1080, but also due to size.

Time for download 18 hrs 25 mins
Average speed 110kb/s (horrible considering I can get 800kb/s on private trackers)
Video 10/10
Audio 10/10
It is crystal clear and amazing! Thnks Ltt_01!"
