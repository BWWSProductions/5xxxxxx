,clownfishrule,2011-02-27T11:31Z,Good stuff! Nice one!
,coololusa,2011-03-05T18:02Z,the key gen is not working. Is it possible that there is any problem with the software running in Windows 7? GetConfID does not bring up any value at all. Any help please? 
,win2011,2011-03-30T23:37Z,"Got to the activation screen, selected 'call us to activate', I called and gave them serial number BPSTU-S1182-TVR28-2322Y but was told the serial number was invalid. Is there another good serial number to use? Thank you 4 your help."
,jaa267,2011-03-31T01:37Z,Worked for me on windows 7!!! Read the readme and take your time.
,win2011,2011-04-01T03:02Z,Thank you jaa267 ... Took your advise about the readme file. It has two different serial numbers listed. Got the correct one in KeyGen and it worked ... Awesome!
,dnbkid303,2011-05-20T22:13Z,"No go for me, used different serial Id's and everything... I keep getting confirmation # you entered is incorrect. Crappy! Thanks for the upload anyway BLACKTROY!"
,dnbkid303,2011-05-20T22:22Z,"Ok it works, but you can't use the serial that he tells you to put in @ the bottom section of the read me file, it must match with the serial that you entered at the beginning... I was wondering why in the hell he would want you to put a different serial # in the key gen than the one you put in the install... lol. must be a typo or some shit. Thanks again for the upload bro you rock!"

,chubbs1002,2011-07-23T10:54Z,"Somehow, I'm still unable to activate this app.

I think I'm confused at step 6 (- when I paste the serial number, I get no activation code. Am I supposed to press a button or some such?

If I select genserID, I get a code of some sort, but the output in the activation box has not worked for me.

Any advice would be helpful."
,MoonDookie,2011-08-27T09:14Z,"Hey, you will need to enter the serial into the keygen without spaces or dashes and will is well,
thanks again!"
,frailejon,2011-08-29T05:01Z,"I have successfully downloaded the program on Windows 7 but can't upload a business plan sample (""Group Publishing"" to be exact). I receive msg: ""Your current security settings do not allow this file to be downloaded"". Any help please?"

,bullma33,2011-09-17T17:06Z,"I there! I have downloaded the file and it works well up til the activation part. The code that i get from Keygen doesn't work...
Anyone got a code that works pls? Thanks for your help!!"
,Robsond76,2011-09-24T14:49Z,"Okay guys, I was having bad trouble with the key generator as well. The readme is horribly written, so I will provide the proper steps here.

1- Run setup.exe (business plan pro.exe)
2 - When you get to the serial number part, insert: BPSTU-S1182-TVR28-2322Y
3 - Install the program.
4 - Launch the program. When it reaches the activation screen, select `Activate by phone `.
5 - On the `activate by phone ` screen of the program, you will see your serial number entered and an activation ID. 
6- Open the Keygen. Where it says serial number, type in the serial number listed on the `activate by phone` screen. Where it says Activation ID, type in the activation ID you see on the `activate by phone ` screen.
7- click generateconfID.
8 - Copy the code generated and place it in the `activate by phone` screen.
9- Click next and youre done.

Hope I helped. I should have because i can`t explain it any simpler.

Thanks Blacktroy for the upload."
,Robsond76,2011-09-24T14:50Z,"As Moondookie said, enter the serialnumber on the `activate by phone` screen into the Key generator without spaces and dashes."
,Robsond76,2011-09-24T15:01Z,"As moondookie said, post the serial into the keygenerator without the dashes and spaces."

,Underride,2011-11-12T20:03Z,Could someone please seed? :)
,jt1221,2012-05-12T05:32Z,"To those having issues... Follow these steps. Major part to also add to these: Do **NOT** include dashes when entering the S/N in the KeyGen. It will NOT work - it will provide you a different confirmation ID than you need to activate the software.

1- Run setup.exe (business plan pro.exe)
 2 - When you get to the serial number part, insert: BPSTU-S1182-TVR28-2322Y
 3 - Install the program.
 4 - Launch the program. When it reaches the activation screen, select `Activate by phone `.
 5 - On the `activate by phone ` screen of the program, you will see your serial number entered and an activation ID. 
6- Open the Keygen. Where it says serial number, type in the serial number listed on the `activate by phone` screen. Where it says Activation ID, type in the activation ID you see on the `activate by phone ` screen.
 7- click generateconfID.
 8 - Copy the code generated and place it in the `activate by phone` screen.
 9- Click next and youre done.

P.S. - Thanks for the awesome upload, and to the commentor who originally posted these instructions! They should be written up in the readme :-)"
