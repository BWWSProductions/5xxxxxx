,tpbloader,2010-12-09T01:08Z,"Kyramas, did you tried PS32, I rendered 10MP photo in no time on PS32- there's no big difference I suppose?"
,zayson,2010-12-09T01:33Z,"Guys, I can always give you PS64., but it's ""too bitter"" and OnOne is extremely difficult now days., 9 of 10 would hate me after that. Also it can cause crash of this fine PS32 installation forcing you to reinstall OS and start again. Forget about!

Drive PS32, it goes fast and hits hard, also. You will not find better fix soon, I know that.

Make money with it and buy this software!
Be Pirates ""with a style"", best regards!

,Einhaller,2010-12-12T14:08Z,"TPB needs this kind of clean and effective stuff, it was easier than to type purchased password. GREAT WORK ZAYSON!

,zayson,2010-12-13T21:14Z,"safc32, of course it works. And if not, you should describe the problem. There's always somebody to help and give advice.."
,zayson,2010-12-13T21:20Z,"I cannot install the software on daily basis, but the last time I checked it was 08.12. and it was working."
,safc32,2010-12-14T01:29Z,"Ok zayson, firstly thanks  for your reply, however maybe I'm not certain on what this file is meant to do, but I D/L'd the trial from onone website as you described, switched the .dll file to both locations yet I'm still running it as a trial version, with watermarks etc...?? "
,safc32,2010-12-14T14:51Z,"Hang on zayson, I think I've figured it out, I wasn't dropping the .dll in all the right places, seems to be working now, thanks very much :-D "
,safc32,2010-12-15T01:26Z,"Only issue I have now is that PhotoTools 2.6 wont install at all, I'm aware this has nothing to do with this fix however I'd be grateful if anyone could possibly explain a reason for this?

Fantastic job on this btw zayson!!! :-D 8-)"
,zayson,2010-12-15T14:50Z,"Safc32., when you open PS under File- Automate you do not have Photo Tools?"

,Harrygohil,2010-12-23T10:20Z,"Hello Zayson, I totally agree with you! You must buy legal copy eventually... I always do. Many thanks for your kind support."
,Harrygohil,2010-12-23T11:25Z,"Zayson, One question... Would this fix work for Mac? Cheers."
,zayson,2010-12-25T01:55Z,"Harrygohil, of course not! That's other architecture.

,zayson,2011-01-03T10:43Z,Unfortunately yes. You must have (x86) installed. Most of the people have Master Collection and PS is installed in both 64/32 Program Files.. Sorry for trouble.

WTF??!

When everybody leaves I'll still seed this life saving fix., but wtf you're trying to say?!

YOU NEED A SINGLE SECOND TO DOWNLOAD THIS WITH A SINGLE SEEDER!!

There is 50 at least.. FY!"

,Einhaller,2011-02-05T21:15Z,"EiNST3iN, this doesn't work for you., but it works for everyone else.

I installed this in whole neighborhood and all are working- XP, Vista and Win 7. The only point (limit) is that you shoot at PS CS5 42 (86) only with a proper installation, of course. 7 computers works fine!"
,zayson,2011-02-06T00:09Z,"I'll confirm (again) that on the 5th February fresh download from the OnOne official website you can successfully apply this fix to get fully activated Perfect Photo Suite 5.5.

Due to the huge number of reasons some few people will not activate., there's also huge number people will not activate using genuine serial too.

One thing is sure, this is a ""trick"" you should trust 101% and try again and again if you care about your safety and you're not willing to spend 500 bucks at the moment."
,chungwa,2011-02-07T15:41Z,"I, for one, am going to wait until there is a properly tested crack for this because REDT has never worked for me, and this is at least the third version of their release that I've tried, including wasting endless time on workarounds. I'm using Win7 x64 and both Photoshop versions (and it doesn't work on either). Not to discourage anyone else from trying, but the fact that it only seems to work sometimes suggests that this is a very shoddy release. It's not all RedT's fault - the demo versions of OnOne plugins don't work on my system either. "
,gillydie,2011-02-08T19:49Z,"Chungwa , what this torrent has to do with RedT? Why are you people destroying your computers before simple copy/paste of this fix in a few proper places on new installation? Of course it's not RedT.

,mysizexxl,2011-02-08T21:03Z,Thanks Zayson will be seeded up to the new version.
,ronjack5,2011-02-13T18:42Z,"zayson, you are the BOMB!!! Thanks!!!"
,Photojunkie,2011-03-10T11:06Z,"Thankyou, this will be great if this works, Ill get bk with if I got it working, but looking at comments I should have no issues as I installed 32 and 64 bit PSCS5,
Seems like I real easy install also.
nice one."
,Mr.mofo,2011-03-18T17:09Z,"Doesn't work for me neither ... error 200

So I reinstalled and ran it without the fix and ... it doesn't fucking work.

So it ain't the fix that's fucked, it's the software ... and I got it from the OnOne site."
,zayson,2011-03-19T09:00Z,"Hi Mr.Mofo!

Last successful installation I know happen several days ago by one of my friends (Windows 7 Ultimate 64 / Photoshop CS5 32 bit). As I said I cannot and I really do not have opportunity to install on everyday base. Either I will throw myself on new fix just because one or two cannot install..

People, I'd like to hear other experiences too- can you please post anything?

I tried to make similar fix for PS 64 bit and I didn't manage it without to ""flag"" here and there on VT. You should know that this was/is the first, most effective and the cleanest/safest solution World wide, parallel with serial number for OnOne and I strongly believe you (Mr.Mofo) should give it another shot somehow once I cannot have your computer a front of me..

It's just that I cannot believe OnOne would dismantle version ""in the middle"" just because of this specific fix. If so, this happened few days ago what I DO NOT believe.

Now I rely on other comments.

Take care: NO- PS 64 bit. 2-nd, I cannot guarantee it will work after someone's else installations, keygens etc..

Regards. "
,Mr.mofo,2011-03-19T12:56Z,"Synopsis ...

I am running Windows7 Ultimate 64 bit.

The full CS5 master suite is installed with both versions of Photoshop.

When the installer runs it tells me I have the two versions of Photoshop (65/32) installed and then gives me a choice of which one I want to use their software with. I can only choose one, not both options so I went for the 64.

It installs and all the new plugins are available from the automate menu as they should be, but when I launch any of them, I get the 200 error.

This happens both with and without the fix. It isn't the fix that is malfunctioning, it is the software.

For some reason, it does not like 64bit Photoshop, even though it does give you the specific choice to install for that particular version.  "
,zayson,2011-03-19T15:16Z,"OK., can you please give me more details??

By default, after install, you'll have OnOne Folders both in Program Files and Program Files (X86)- right?

Same with Photoshop, it will be installed to both versions- right?

If so, the only thing you should do is to copy fix into (x86) folders- both. Then you'll start PSCS5 (x86) and NOT 64 bit.

I'm in remote area right now and I cannot upload 5.5 working version.. However I AM sure it's impossible to bring 200 Error in the case I mention (-200) and I'm 99% percent sure that OnOne has not removed vulnerability by the day present (I have strong reason to believe so).

However this I'll check when I come back home.

Regards."
,rbrown391,2011-03-26T01:53Z,It seems the fix just doesn't like PS 64 bit. I have it installed in both PS 64 bit and PS 32 bit but only the 32 bit version works for me. In the 64 bit version I get the activation library could not be located error.
,mysizexxl,2011-03-28T02:17Z,"FIX IS WORKING!

FIX IS WORKING LIKE ALWAYS., FROM THE DAY ""A""!!  This is NOT for Photoshop 64 but  3 2   B I T!!
"
,zayson,2011-03-29T09:25Z,"It is working with a latest downloaded version..

Win 32 or 64 and PS (any) 32 bit. Just copy file in a proper destinations."
,pakkar9,2011-05-11T06:20Z,"Hi guys,
If you canât find the plug-ins after you've installed them, go to the File > Automate menu or go to Window > Extensions > onOne. Thatâs where the plug-ins all live.
*PLEASE TAKE NOTE AS THIS VERSION OF PHOTOTOOLS IS DIFFERENT AS COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS ONE*"

It possibly cannot work if you played around with other activators, cracks or whatever else and IT CANNOT work if you apply this fix improperly. WILL work on ANY Windows 32 or 64bit and WILL NOT work on Photoshop 64bit but only Photoshop 32bit (any build). "
