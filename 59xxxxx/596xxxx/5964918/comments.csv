comments that globeplus has prooved to be on the top in the list of rippers by his work. 

Words never speak but the work speaks itself. If u guys have the potential to prove urself 

best ripper then stop criticising globeplus and do the damn good work in future. I honestly 

say that I have deleted all TPTB rip from my hard drive because many of them never work for 

me so i just flushed them and downloaded globeplus rips instead.

Google for a appropriate dolphin revision and settings if you run into problems. Sometimes an old build is better than a new one. And last but not least you will get a faster download than with Globe.

,ztech123,2010-11-22T01:23Z,"First of all, globeplus - Thanks for the game.

Second, 
the download size is 1.88 GB
After you unARC, it's 7.7GB
After you globe convert, it's 4.6GB

Third, 
The reason why globeplus' game size is so small is because - audio and cutscene videos have been converted into lower resolution/quality so that file sizes are small. Something has also been done to the graphics as the demo on my PS3 had much better graphics.

If you want the full quality, please download the 7GB torrent. If you are on slow networks on have a crap PC and dont care about the tree textures, please download this by all means."

Globeplus, your rips are pretty good, ive never had any trouble unzipping them and getting the games to run.... but your video conversion is almost 50% reduced in certain games which does kind of effect the game quailty overall but thats just me being picky... you do save me alot of time downloading though... but any torrent thats a rip has been super slow. 

Now TPTB (the power that be) you guys have shown no respect for your fellow uploaders, youve managed to bring your name into the ground!!! why??? Because i love your rips, theres never anything missing accept language files or multiplayer extras that are not needed, your video converstion are untouched which is awsome but it does mean a bigger file to download but it doesnt bother me as im on a fast internet service .... but guys your losing respect and this means no seeders so i guess youve fucked yourself real good...

,ac1d69,2010-12-01T10:27Z,"@subzero

You do realise how pathetic you sound right? your argument is that he wrights wrong info like full game when he ripped languages and other NIT PICKING! And not on the actual quality / playability of the rip. 

(Makes you look like a wanker, troll and a retard).

I was always a fan of TPTB but you an shroo coming to Globe@'s torrents all the time and saying the SAME bullshit in every torrent is making me (and many others I'm sure) stop downloading and seeding your rips. He don't go to your torrents an trolling them.

With that said. A lot of globe@'s rips were crap an a lot didn't work for me an you can fuck right off if I'm gonna download 10+ fixes to a rip (some of Globe@'s rips are like this -LAME-)
^
Main reason I stuck with TPTB but all your BS lately made me give Globe@ another chance. Downloaded MOH and worked fine, now ima try this.

+ his rips are always smaller than TPTB and when he gets a bit better TBTB will be no more imo. + he pumps out WAY more rips (of games we actually want to play lol than TPTB)

When you are missing a DLL file, you can simply download the one you missing!

,crazyman1,2011-03-09T17:47Z,"the prob is that it is not extracting completely so what i did is:
1. i extracted using peazip instead of freearc
2. then rebooted and got into safe mode or alternatively u can disable unwanted startups and processes using msconfig and then restart coz the prob is i think some background processes are interfering with the extraction and therefore not extracting completely.
3. then run the globe converter

it worked for me when i did this in safe mode after unsuccessfully installing 2 or 3 times without safe mode.."

,Aniketwww,2011-04-06T10:24Z,hey thanks globeplus:) game is working but i have only 1 question-after installation-Need for Speed(TM) Hot Pursuit folder is only 4.63GB? is it true or only me? plz comment thanks again!
,Aniketwww,2011-04-06T10:29Z,thanks man game is working fine but it is only 4.63GB after installation! why ?
,Loading..,2011-04-11T10:11Z,"Wow great torrent. Game works fine on my Windows 7 ultimate 64bit no problem at all. Its just 1.88 gb, amazing and on top of it no installation no crack nothing.
         It extracts to 10 gb and after running Globe converter.exe its about 4.6gb which is amazing. I think everyone who make torrents should compress the game using this ARC format. It becomes easy for people to download.
     Thanks to 'globeplus' for this awesome torrent. Please can you make torrents for games like Gta4 and Dead space 2 :). Torrents of these games are freaking huge. Gta4 is about 13.5gb and dead space 2 is 15-16gb. Although there's one torrent which is about 10gb. But even that is big."

,Pra85,2011-04-14T08:36Z,"thanks a lot,there is no problem in running this game. I have also found the way to patch this game with the latest patch version1.0.4.0 

Steps
1-Download the Patch #4 from http://www.needforspeed.com/downloads

2-also download this torrent
http://www.kickasstorrents.com/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-reloaded-crack-only-t4689984.html

3-now for easy installation of the patch,put the game directory to the Program Files folder 

4-now after successful installation of the patch ,replace the crack file from the torrent above

5-now u r ready to play but dont let it connect to the internet 

(worked for me ,even though i did the version 1.0.4.0 ,at the installation time it showed that it was updating to ver 1.0.3.0 from 1.0.1.0) "
