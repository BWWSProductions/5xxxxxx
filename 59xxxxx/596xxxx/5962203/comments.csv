,Choebee,2010-11-22T17:38Z,"unsuccessful with ios 222, 249, 250 using usb loader GX"
,TheColonel19,2010-11-26T00:42Z,Works great on wiiflow and cfg loader thanks uploader. btw this game is alot better than worms - a space oddity!!!!!!
,MoviemMRZ,2010-11-26T22:39Z,"Dont work with WBFS =(

Can someone make an install info for me?"
,ezwider,2010-11-28T22:54Z,"It works, you need to set the IOS to 223 (not 222), also make sure that the VIDTV patch is set to ""ON"".  I am using USB loader GX so I dont know about Wii Flow.  And it worked with my WBFS just fine, I thought it was weird that the scrubbed file size ended up being .06 GB, but thats just how small it is :) .

WAY better than worms a space oddity, that game was a turd.  This uses a power bar instead of flinging the remote, and moving around is easier, and there are more weapons."
,cyberdog54,2010-11-30T22:03Z,"Wii 4.2E
with wiiflow 2.2

ios 223 with video patch on

,MoviemMRZ,2010-11-30T23:14Z,"ezwider, 
I tried IOS to 223 (not 222) and VIDTV patch is set to ""ON"". Still just freeze on the loading screen. :( So far all other games works. I also think it's wird that the scrubbed file size ended up being .06 GB."

,magicsi,2010-12-04T23:35Z,"for all those that carnt get this to work, search torrentz for Black Ops Files For Wii USB Loader GX. it works for all new games"
,MoviemMRZ,2010-12-11T14:47Z,"Will give this game a new try today. If it fail I will see what the Black Ops files are and type a guide if it works for me,"
,MoviemMRZ,2010-12-13T07:23Z,Worked when I tried IOS 222.
,tlong2828,2011-01-05T17:52Z,"I use CFG 62-222 with 223 w/o VIDTV
