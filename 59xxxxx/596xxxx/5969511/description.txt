Nirinjan`s first Spirit Voyage release is a masterful
production by Hans Christian. Nirinjan Kaur has created
an incredible collection of rich, powerful and deeply
moving Kundalini chants, Gurbani kirtan and devotional
songs wrapped in layers of cello, acoustic guitar,
bansuri flute, sarangi, sitara, nyckelharpa, tablas and
more.

With a stellar cast of musicians including GuruGanesha
Singh, Manish Vyas, Hans Christian, John Wubbenhorst and
Victor DeLorenzo, this album is not only a sacred journey
but also a musical masterpiece.
