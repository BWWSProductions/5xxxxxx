Storyline:

Four Iraq war veterans, led by Col. John 'Hannibal' Smith, on the run from the US military who suspect them of committing a crime, set about trying to clear their names.
Becoming mercenaries and employing a wide range of uniquely offensive skills mixed in with a healthy dose of eccentric behavior,
Smith and his cohorts, 'Faceman' Peck, 'Howling Mad' Murdock and 'B.A.' Baracus,
set out to right the wrong done to them by any means necessary - and some that aren't.
