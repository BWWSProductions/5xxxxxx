Windows XP Pro Performance Edition SP3 November 2010

Original Size: 595 mb
New Size: 358 mb (Difference of 237 mb)
(This is the Size of the ISO)

BEFORE COMMENTING OR ASKING ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS THOROUGHLY!

This supports ALL Languages and ALL Keyboard Layouts.

This is a FULL Install. You CANNOT Upgrade from previous versions of Windows.
There is no validation required. This PASSES WGA. This works 100% with Windows Update.
I have included the CD-Key already in the install process. This means at no point will you have to enter it.
Some people using Macs or Virtual Machines might need the serial. See Serial.txt if you do need it.
Serial.txt is located in the download folder and in a folder on the disc/iso.
This has all windows updates through November 2010. This is has been tested numerous times with no errors.
This has minimalist Internet Explorer 6. (Use It To Download Firefox, Opera, Safari, Chrome, Etc)
This is the x86 version (32Bit).

Almost all drivers have been stripped from this release. You must install all necessary drivers on your own.

Updates currently work fine and this also currently passes WGA.

This is set to automatically log you in each time you start up. If you want to be prompted for a username and password
please see the "TJ" folder on the disc. It contains a registry patch that you can run to have it prompt for username and password again.
This folder on the disc also contains numerous other little tweak applications, registry patches & More.

I have integrated the latest DirectX & System runtimes. I have removed the original Net Framework that ships with XP. It's super old and outdated.
You can still download and use a newer version however. Just download the latest version from Microsoft.com or Windows Update.

This CANNOT be installed via a USB Drive. Sorry, Critical files needed for a USB install have been removed to keep size very small.

I have disabled and deleted the Classic Windows XP Install Screens with the info about XP and the blue Background.
You will just see a black background now and the install will look similar to 2000. This saves Space and gives more
info while installing.

The Minimum HD and RAM Requirements have been lifted. You can try and install this on whatever machine you like now.
High ISO Compression has been enabled to save space.

Patches:
TCP/IP Half-Open Connections = 1000 (Default 10)
UXTheme Patch (Allows Unsigned Themes to be applied to XP)
Windows System File Checker Disabled (SFC)

Install Notes:
1. Unrar the Archive(s) using WinRAR or 7Zip. This will produce an ISO file.
2. Burn the ISO using a program such as IMGBurn, Nero, Alcohol 120, Blindwrite, ect... (Burn at a slow Speed to ensure no errors, 1x-4x)
3. Change Bios Priority settings so it boots from the CD-ROM Drive First. (You may be able to skip this step)
4. Insert Disc and Reboot PC, Follow the on screen prompts and enjoy.

Notes:
If you are getting errors while copying files. It's your CD, not the release. Try burning it to different brand of cd/media and try burning at the slowest speed possible.
I just tested this in VMWare and it works flawless. You should get between 16-19 Processes and under 100mb of ram usage when using the computer initially.
Everything you install/use will obviously increase this, however its the leanest XP Copy around.
