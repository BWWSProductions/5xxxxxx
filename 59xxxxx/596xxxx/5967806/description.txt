Hey kids, I'm making Taryn's Transcripts available in perpetuity since the bots kept harassing everyone who posted it on their site. (This is the complete set for Pimsleur Mandarin One.)

**********
INTRODUCTION


You will find this transcript helpful if:
1. You are a visual learner.
2. Learning to read Chinese is just as important to you as learning to speak it.
3. You don't want to rely on pinyin.
4. You prefer a syllable-for-syllable transcript of what you're hearing.

These transcripts include the English narrator (12pt Times New Roman) and all of the spoken Chinese in simplified text (18pt Sim-Sun). 

If you choose to print out the pages double-sided, you'll notice that the page numbers and lesson numbers are printed on the bottom outside corners. Times for the lessons are indicated at 3-minute intervals on the outside margin next to the corresponding line of dialogue.

Enjoy your studies,
-taryn
