I'm finally starting to catch up. Should be up to date tomorrow, if not, for sure after the weekend.

Thanks again everyone!

,FluxCapacitor,2010-11-19T02:54Z,"Yesssss! thank you very much!

but some of your torrents are lacking seeds ... please make them available and i will re-seed them!"
,xAlkaline13x,2010-11-19T06:16Z,"Flux - Im kinda new to this and have no idea what you mean. 

Ive been seeding since I uploaded. Do I need to do something else?

Thanks!"
,FluxCapacitor,2010-11-19T21:13Z,"Several of your torrents have zero effective seeds.  You may need to re-download your own .torrent files and re-load them in your torrent program (utorrent is best!) and maybe even re-start your torrent program and reboot your computer just to be on the safe side.  You might also add these trackers to your torrents:  http://tracker.publicbt.com/announce, and udp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce."
