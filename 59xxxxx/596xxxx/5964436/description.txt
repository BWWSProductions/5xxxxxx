Christian calls his wife's friend Brooke over to help him cook his wife a special dinner for her birthday. Brooke inspects the ingredients, and when they get started, it seems Christian is more interested in Brooke's body than cooking. After some heavy flirting, Christian makes his move, and Brooke wants to be a good friend, but she just can't help herself.
