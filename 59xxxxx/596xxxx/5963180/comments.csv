This is RUBBISH"
,thecompleteguitarist,2010-11-22T17:22Z,"RE Quality:
In the info it does say
""Source= Megamind 2010 CAM XVID LU""

and the word CAM kind of speaks for itself. Greenskull or not."
,Adolf_Lucifer,2010-12-02T22:02Z,"""In the info it does say
""Source= Megamind 2010 CAM XVID LU""

Yeah, hidden away right at the bottom - but in the title it has ""HQ"" - and why the hell would anyone make a nearly four and a half gig file from a cam? Looks to me like a sheep in wolf's clothing.
Waste of time downloading this when you can get equally bad copies with a fraction of the filesize."
