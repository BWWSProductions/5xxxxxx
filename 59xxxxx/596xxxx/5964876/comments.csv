Can somebody please tell me / others how to do this. Ive been through all the comments on PB relating to Garmin NT and everyone writes yes it works but no info at all"
,kammi,2011-01-01T16:53Z,"@Darko_J:
Ive got a 760, and it can´t find ( on a separate SD-card) the latest map (2011.30 NT) It´s over 2gb. Do U know how to get pass that?
Hopefully it will accept 2010.10 when I reinstalled it.......
