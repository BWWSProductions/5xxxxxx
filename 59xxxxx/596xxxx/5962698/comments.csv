It was just nominated for an Oscar today on Jan, 25, 2011.  I guess the foiking Hollywood Jews are throwing bugs at TPB.
Whatever, I'm sticking it out.  The other foiking ""Winter's Bone"" torrents are dead for some reason today.
I'll be back to confirm if this damn biatche ever loads."

,Rsniper2,2011-11-17T01:19Z,"Great torrent
Decent download speed ~500 mbps +
V: 9/10
A: 10/10
A chilling and dark movie. A dominant sense of hostility, danger, and suspense drives the movie forward. Highly recommended."
