Alien Voices, Inc. was formed in 1996 to create multi-media works of science fiction and fantasy. Its three founding members were actor/director Leonard Nimoy, actor/director/writer John de Lancie, and award-winning writer/producer Nat Segaloff. The first two Alien Voices audio titles were published in the spring of 1997 by industry leader Simon & Schuster Audio: H.G. Wells's THE TIME MACHINE and Jules Verne's JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH. December 1997 heralded the release of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's THE LOST WORLD. May 1998 brought Wells' THE INVISIBLE MAN, and in November 1998, THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON was released. The first of two Star TrekÂ® titles, SPOCK VS. Q, starring Leonard and John in the very first occurrence of these two Star Trek characters meeting, was released in October 1999. The second, SPOCK VS. Q: THE SEQUEL (of course!) appeared in December 2000.

Nimoy and de Lancie headline the dramas. The casts have included actors and actresses from various Star Trek television and feature film series, among them: Susan Bay, Roxann Dawson, Richard Doyle, Robert Ellenstein, Marnie Mosiman, Ethan Phillips, Andrew Robinson, Dwight Schultz, William Shatner, Armin Shimmerman, and Jean Simmons.
