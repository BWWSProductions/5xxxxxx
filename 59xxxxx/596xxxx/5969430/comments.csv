,1TWISTED,2010-11-20T18:24Z,"thanks,.. nice job,.. well done,.. ; )"
[V],globeplus,2010-11-20T18:43Z,"To arulkarthik : You need to run the autorun.exe but if you did anything wrong that it is probable , open the data folder on the app folder and run the reg correspondent to your bits machine , you can run both if you want , it is safe .

This version is 6.0.0.73 (main executable) ."
[V],globeplus,2010-11-20T19:09Z,"6.5 is the latest version , i donÂ´t find yet anywhere , but i can guarantee this one is close to this latest one , so nobody dies , sometimes to really get the latest version of an application you need to hang a while until it will be possible the use , for all the applications it is not immediatly that the more recent one it is available with verything ok for a torrent use but in what it is available and can be used this is the best one ."
,shatru,2010-11-20T21:46Z,thanks. I asked because I already have v6.0

,nightmarechapz,2010-11-21T13:17Z,i cant get it working when i run set up theres no serial number like the one in your video there and i cant get pass that bit 
,jimmjet,2010-12-17T04:09Z,"It's not working either with the video or without... the activation screen is still appearing and i've applied the reg file too.

Avoid downloading..."
,fuzzybuz,2011-01-15T04:16Z,"The uploader's attempt at posting a video was meant with good intentions I'm sure, but failed miserably based on the quality of it. What good is one if it's so small and such low rez? Anyway the install is simple: 1. start keygen. Copy company name and leave open. 2. Start install. Paste company name when prompted. 3. Generate serial from keygen and copy. 3. Paste serial into SS. 4. Continue install.

All of this may be moot anyway because I get a  application error after an encode based on msvcr80.dll I believe and the program closes. Tried on two pc's, same result. So something is buggy somewhere."
,fuzzybuz,2011-01-15T04:59Z,oops had 2 pages open when I added the above comment. The video comment stands. The install comment was in reference to another file. Sorry
