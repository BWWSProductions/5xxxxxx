Ok, so some of the purists will try and find obscure tracks that the masses don't want to listen or moan about the fact that its all been done before and to be honest it has. I love Vienna Calling by Falco and that never appears on a compilation but I have every single remix available, so why worry that it's not on this selection! The idea of this CD is to put it in your CD player and just enjoy the tracks, sing along if you want or even bust a few school disco moves. It's an 80's compilation for the masses and its really good at that.
