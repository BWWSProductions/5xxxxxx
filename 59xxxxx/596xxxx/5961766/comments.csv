,Broz007,2010-11-18T19:44Z,Please seed! PLEASE!!!!!
,christos780,2010-11-19T11:56Z,"0,0%"
,mysteryfancy,2010-11-19T15:42Z,"@ captinjake

Please seed itself. I've run the thing already 3 days without success :-("
,captinjake,2010-11-21T08:38Z,"Ok guys, im seeding for a while."
,FS_Junkie,2010-11-21T12:28Z,"Hey, Captin ... don't want to sound ungrateful and all that, but you need to seed until at least one other person has it complete ... so they can seed on ..."
,mysteryfancy,2010-11-22T19:36Z,"Oh man, I really do not even nervous. But, what is this, from my first message today through 0.0% download rate??"
,FS_Junkie,2010-11-22T23:17Z,"It's captinjake's first torrent, so it looks like he may not fully understand the way things work.
@Jimstalk - did you you manage to grab the archive? If so, could *you* seed it for a while?"
,mysteryfancy,2010-11-23T18:47Z,"ok, I'll let it run again. If it succeeds, then I can help with seeding"
,FS_Junkie,2010-11-25T00:59Z,"This torrent is DEAD, DEFUNCT, DECEASED, PASSED ON, SNUFFED IT. *Don't even bother trying to download it*.

@captinjake - PLEASE LEARN HOW TO UPLOAD TORRENTS so we don't all just WASTE OUR TIME."
,mysteryfancy,2010-11-25T12:14Z,"Ooops, thanks for the information FS_Junkie ...  
...I'm going to bed at last  :-) "
,31k4b0ng,2010-12-06T00:35Z,"Could someone who is familiar with the processing of seeding please re-upload this torrent? There's 17 folks in my swarm who have this queued for download, so this is clearly a popular torrent. I've had this in my queue since November 17, and I haven't received a single bit of it, despite captinjake claiming he was seeding it. 

Jake, if you really want to have a go at this whole torrenting thing, set this torrent to forced seed and then leave that program and your computer on for at least a week. When the torrent has been fully propagated, THEN you can shut things down."
