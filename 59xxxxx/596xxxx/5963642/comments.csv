,07paul,2010-11-22T21:01Z,"Sorry, ""No input file specified."""
,hughesa2002,2010-11-23T06:04Z,"hi there... try the magnet link (the little pik of the magnet), 47 other people are seeding/leeching so it does work :Z"
,07paul,2010-11-23T13:37Z,"Yeah thanks the Magnet link worked. Iv'e never used a Magnet before so i didn't know about that, Thanks! I'll seed for as long as posible!"
,hughesa2002,2010-11-24T07:11Z,"to all the people snatching... FUCK YOU ALL... you're the reason that torrents die, your a disgrace to the sharing community. ive seeded to 15 ratio now and there are now only 3 other people seeding... thanks 07paul, i hope you keep your word and seed. a ratio of 2 would be much appreciated :)"
,hughesa2002,2010-11-25T06:01Z,well.... now up to 30 ratio... 8 full days of continual uploading and still only 4 other seeds. fuck you snatchers.
,edgeyy,2010-12-12T21:33Z,"sucks that seeding died on this, no input file :/

usualy just throw stuff on my HTPC and seed from there, hence pretty much 17hours a day 7 days a week seeding.

really love this guy as a comedian... shame i cannot download and watch again :/"
,hughesa2002,2010-12-26T20:51Z,seeding isnt dead... your a retard...
,jamieguk,2011-03-29T06:39Z,torrent files not working and magnet link dont seem to work for me either what a shame
