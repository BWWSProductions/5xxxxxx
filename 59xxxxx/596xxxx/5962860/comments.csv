The average bit rate on this 720p rip reads 2695 kbps. The 1080p Kingdom release Honchorella rip is 3290 kbps for just 150MB more.
How?"
[V],Team_xRG,2010-11-18T08:42Z,"^ there is not rule how much bitrate should be.. 
each encoder rips in the way he/she feels best..

[V],Team_xRG,2010-11-19T00:57Z,i would sayi  u want to watch movie now go for scene rips if u cant download tht sizes then this rip should be good until hdlite encodes.. imo ..
,falconss,2010-11-19T11:39Z,"Team_xRG it seems that you are anti secret_myth :) You said ""why do i feel quality is not same like beforE"" explain please in technical terms as lots of us here are pretty good in technical teams.

HDLiTE post G8 rips but did you forget from where he started. 

Again please, and that's pretty please, explain to us your knowledge of this movie rip and rate it in comparison to whats out their on the same parameters :)

cheers"
,somedude.1001,2010-11-19T17:52Z,"@SecretMyth

Sound is out of sync in wmplayer, not only this file but all of your recent .mp4 releases that Ive got. They are fine in vlc though."
,anarchore,2010-11-21T02:21Z,More mp4 bullshit!
,Lithium5,2010-11-21T03:35Z,"MP4 > AVI

Just use VLC player, it plays everything"
,somedude.1001,2010-11-21T05:41Z,"I know, I just love the wmplayer+klite codec combination. vlc sometime has problems like screen tearing playing avi, and skipping frames on weak comp (netbook or old pc) while wmplayer does not.

Im downloading HolyRoses release of this anyway. His uploads are always perfect."
,imaddict,2010-11-21T21:46Z,"thanx SM for coming back, was missing your rips.
no matter what people say, i still think this is the best rip available on the net.

,mankardo,2010-12-16T03:21Z,"I'm aware that this may not be the place to ask this, but I feel that many people who comment on these torrents have a great deal of knowledge regarding my situation so here goes. I'm downloaded movies and putting them onto an network storage hard drive to stream to my xbox 360. Now the 360 shouldnt have any problems playing mp4 files, but the xbox claims these files are unreadable. Any suggestions?"
,dak1b,2010-12-18T10:37Z,"v:a 10/10

Great upload! thanks!!!"
,browniecoyote,2010-12-23T11:00Z,Hey m a gr8 fan of secretmyth..i currently have 19 inch lcd..my question is how secretmyth torrents will look on Full hd lcd 32 inch..plz let me know..thxs anyways fr the upload..
,Monster42,2010-12-25T13:08Z,I am downloading it with 600/ 700 kbps. Pretty fast!!!
,zato1,2010-12-26T01:24Z,@mankardo--the xbox doesn't play movie files with surround sound. That's why it's not working. You can re-encode with xilisoft.
,Sit3UserX,2010-12-28T23:19Z,Great quality. A:10 / V:10. Thanks.
,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-01-02T11:42Z,"Secretmyth.... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do a brrip of ""Walk the Line"" 2005 starring Joaquin Phoenix. Please I'm begging you :)"
,ultimagic,2011-01-02T16:55Z,"@zato1
what if you use a digital output for audio and connected to THX speakers?"
,xtorrentaddictx,2011-01-08T23:58Z,"i know secretmyth is good and all but, people, seed, seed, if you actully like secret myth, be it because their torrents are always good quality, theyre always brrips, the brrips are .mp4 instead of .mkv, or any other reason, show this  by SEEDING THIS. people, it's currently taking me 1 day to download, this is impossible. i mean, it's 3 Gb, nothing that should take you ONE F*CKING DAY! on the other hand, i appreciate ur work secretmyth, and will seed this torrent, for atleast what i d/lded.
cheers.
hope to be soon back here commenting on quality."
,Wisely123,2011-01-12T08:46Z,I dont get it. why is this one only 3GB but the other ones 6 GB? they are both 720p o.O?
