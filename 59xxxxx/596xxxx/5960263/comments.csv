,nameless001,2010-12-01T18:26Z,"I'm having some problems with this torrent.
Whenever I open the folder in which the .mkv is located or whenever I play the .mkv file,
my physical memory usage slowly runs from +- 30% to +- 95% and I have to restart my pc..
I'm using media classic player with the k-lite 6.6.0 codec pack to play .mkv files.
Anyone who knows what is causing this problem? I never had problems playing .mkv files before..

Thanks in advance!

And thanks to the uploader anyway!"

Nice upload! Enjoyed it very much."
