,PauloFran,2011-09-07T23:28Z,Wonderful movie !!
,jobbers77,2012-01-16T18:45Z,"MPC wouldn't allow me to turn the subtitles off.  if this happens to you, just use VLC player"
,the_lopan,2012-04-24T01:43Z,"This is the Director's Cut.

Very good encode except for the dozen or so frame skips.

I thought the movie would be better based on all the hype. It looks sci-fi but it's in fact more of a fantasy movie with a few vague sci-fi concepts.

Thanks for the rip YIFI."
