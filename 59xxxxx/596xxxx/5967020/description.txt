Carlos The Jackal

Sought by Western intelligence for over 20 years, his name was synonymous with political terrorism in the 1970s. Mastermind behind the terrorist attack on Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, his most infamous feat was the 1975 kidnapping of 11 OPEC ministers meeting in Vienna. Captured in 1994, The Sudan turned him over to France to face murder and other charges. See how an overweight Venezuelan boy, Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, turned himself into a swaggering, cold-blooded killer.
