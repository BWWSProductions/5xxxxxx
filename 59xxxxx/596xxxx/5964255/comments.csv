Also is sunflower installed with this?"
,SimpleSim0n,2010-11-18T21:52Z,"Oh my fucking god!

Could you be any stupider? You actually posted your real name, a lame website and want donations?

Why don't you just call the cops and ask them to arrest you for pirating software and being a moron!!

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA  !!  !!!!  !!!!"
,rhflem12345,2010-11-18T21:52Z,"I get ""No input file specified."" when I try to get the torrent."
,AngryRedPlanet,2010-11-20T19:44Z,"I got the same ""No input file specified."" when I clicked on the first link -DOWNLOAD THIS -

But succeeded with the (MAGNET LINK). First time I’ve used that option. But it seems to be working fine for me (15% already), using Mac’s Transmission client.

We’ll see later when I try to open this weird “.rar.part” type file. May have to move it over to my PC to extract first. 

It I get this to work, I’ll leave another comment with tips on how I did it."
,AngryRedPlanet,2010-11-20T21:16Z,"IT WORKS! Way to go Adrian, youâ€™re a real torrent pro!

I used Stuffit Expander, followed his instructions, and now itâ€™s up and running, registered and everything!!!!

Except that the torrent includes the updated version (2.0.1), which I ignored, since it didnâ€™t say -[kâ€™ed]- in the title. I clicked on Skip when the program prompted me to download the latest version, since I wanâ€™t sure if Adrian included the 2.0.1 dmg because of a problem of getting it straight from the website if the original is [kâ€™ed].

If it works for you too, donate a few bucks to this guy for his hard earned work on this!!!"
,SimpleSim0n,2010-11-20T23:38Z,"Jesus Christ, you are as stupid as the uploader AngryRedPlanet 

This wasn't this morons works he copied the info from someone else and took credit for the other persons work.
 Look on Demonoid or MSJ or MacBB you fucking newb!"
,ben5240,2010-12-14T23:32Z,"Works well, nice upload. You do not need to purchase a microphone, however, the program recommends that you do, but again it is not needed.

Thanks Adrian!"

,Douggieboy,2011-07-23T04:37Z,"I downloaded this for installation using OSX Lion, and it doesn't work.

The program installs properly, but when I double click on the license agreement and it asks for the English language DMG file, clicking that as per your instructions produces a message pop-up saying ""No mountable content is in the selected package.""

I have the English CD DMG image, but to make a long story alittle shorter, my computer says that it cannot be mounted. Disc Utility was equally useless.

Repeating the steps puts me into a dead loop. I can't get the installation to finish. Please help."

,dlarrym1111,2011-10-24T09:56Z,"@VR: I have owned Apple computer from there beginning. I had an original 1981 APPLE II, then AN APPLE IIe, the APPLE IIc the LISA, The first Mac, all the way up to the Mac Pro i have now and I only mention these things because I have NEVER known an Apple or MAC that had a ""built in Microphone"" (I won't swear that apple has NEVER made a computer with a built in microphone, maybe some lap tops have a built in mic. They do have built in Mic, jack 3 mm INPUT Jack and a 3 mm MIC OUTPUT jack. They do usually have a built in speaker for mono sound OUT for those without a set of speakers for your system. SOOOO, YES, you will most likely need to purchase a microphone. (I suggest a SHURE SM58 with an adapter jack to reduce the 1/4"" jack that the SHURE MIC will come with, down to the HEADPHONE jack size ) and plug that into your INPUT jack. However, most Computer stores (BEST BUYS will have a USB ported microphone that may be easier and less expensive) 
Note: 

I am not sure if sunflower will work or not, I know I do not select that as my music setting when using this program. hope this helps."
,mmkremer,2011-10-28T21:30Z,has anyone got it working on lion? It just keeps crashing on me.
,Grymadin,2011-11-06T01:25Z,"Sheesh, I expect some flaming from this but some people who believe they are so friggin smart sure show how dumb they are when the open their mouths or use their keyboard.

@Simplesim0n aka: dumbass #1 on this thread. You mention that Adrian Dennis uses his name on this thread. Are you so freakin stupid that you can not realize that could be an alias, like yours? Is SimpleSim0n dumbass your real name? I believe the dumbass part is for sure to even post that. 

onto stupid person number 2 in this thread

@diarrym1111 - you mention all the Macs you have seen in your life (because your obviously not smart enough to operate them) when you answer someones question without even doing some research. If I was to list all the computers that I have OWNED in my life, There would not be enough room on a webpage to even list them (sarcasm intended as a webpage can be infinite). Yes, Macbook Pro's have built in Microphones. I use mine almost everyday to either do speech commands to my Mac, use facetime to chat with my daughter or mother, or to dictate emails. I repeat, Macbook Pro's have a built-in MIC and if you were not aware, they have a built-in cameras also. While we're at it, MBP's have built in RAM, LCD Screens, Processors, Keyboards, Wireless Network Adapters, Superdisc DVD burners, and several other components. 

And as for the MIC, I am using it with this Dragon Dictate software to write this comment.

Sorry ppl, I'm off my meds and taking no prisoners (not being understanding of stupid people). I had to post here because my wife was getting tired to being the brunt of my aggression. Thanks for the nice, cool, working torrent Adrian Dennis aka Adrian Dennis. 

Grymadin OUT!"
,jpengwin,2011-11-06T05:15Z,"Is it safe to update?
I want to use the iPod remote microphone but you have to update to version 2.5 for it to be compatible.
As for needing a MIC, I am using the Mac’s built-in microphone at the moment and it’s working fine. It hasn’t made a mistake for this entire comment.
Thanks!"
,alkwef,2011-11-27T05:36Z,"@jpengwin 
If you want the NEWEST version, go to:
<
bit.
ly/uDRSME
>
for the data disk and app (v2.5.1). 

If the app above doesn't work (known problem for some ppl), try:
<
bit.
ly/uDRSME
>
for a different app, but you MUST (again, MUST) use the data disk in the first torrent so don't just skip over it."
,Titans41,2011-12-28T21:31Z,"Please Help; I have tried to use the unachriver and stuffit, neither of these could open the .rar file once it downloaded. So I am redownloading and trying it again. I can't get passed right after the download it just says can't extract or something to that extent. Please help. Thanks."

,GrunnyRiku,2012-04-29T01:56Z,@Grymadin Thank you for proving the point that this software actually works and is a good torrent. and for standing up for macbooks everywhere ^.^
,ellime,2012-06-12T08:33Z,"its so easy you do not need for it to be a DMG file just go to this website: 
http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html

download The Unarchiver then double click on the RAR file or open with The Unarchiver and it will extract the files from the torrent and 
BAM mission accomplish!"
,ellime,2012-06-12T09:16Z,"it works great thanks 

for any microphone set up for mac you just need to: 
STEP 1***system preference > Speech> then select the mic from the drop menu and calibrate the mic

STEP 2***then double click the Dragon dictate icon

STEP 3*** then in the top menu says  ""Tools""  click then go to microphone setup Stop there****

STEP 4 ***now Click on the license key where you opened the DMG extension click OK,
