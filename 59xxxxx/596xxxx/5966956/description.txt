 Album Info..: 
 
 Time Pieces is a good single-disc collection of Eric Clapton's solo hits -- including "I Shot the Sheriff," "After Midnight," "Wonderful Tonight," Derek & the Dominos' "Layla," and "Cocaine" -- that has since been supplanted by the more thorough The Cream of Eric Clapton, which combines his solo work with selections of his Cream and  Blind Faith work. Nevertheless, the compilation still provides a good introduction for neophyte Clapton fans, especially those that just want copies of his '70s hits.
