,mb_webguy,2010-11-18T20:36Z,"Btw, if your download speed seems a bit slow, it's because no one else who's already downloaded the file seems to be seeding it, and this torrent is so small that it only has three pieces.  Larger torrents with more pieces and at least a handful of seeds would result in much faster download speeds.
