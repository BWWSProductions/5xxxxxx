,falconss,2010-11-18T16:53Z,"siddhart - I have downloaded XviD AC3-ViSiON a 3.81GB Video: 1280x536 | 3127Kbps- 
and S.M and I can say is MUCH BETTER even though ViSiON has a very high bitRate but their SOURCE is a 720p.BluRay-CROSSBOW

S.M version is 100% better then ViSiONis.

the honchorella- Kingdom Release, which is BRRip 1080p x264 AAC which has a Resolution: 1920 x 800 and a Min Bitrate of 2972 kbps. And thats a first from him at that resolution. :)

I have downloaded the sample and it looks pretty good.

You should download S.M sample and honchorella sample and see which one you like :) Personally I think they are the best ones on the net for now

Hope this solve your dilemma.
Cheers"

secret_myth rocks...."
,Makaylah,2010-11-19T03:09Z,Does anyone know if this includes DVD commentary?
,falconss,2010-11-19T09:17Z,"Is S.M is really back? Only time will show us.
Remember that S.M is a user at kingdom-kvcd.net. (Just like honchorella and other G8 Ripers) and any of his team can use that user name and rip and post them at the quality they require. The higher the quality the longer it takes to rip. Some movies will take more then a day to rip. But they getting better and better every day. 

in regards to S.M quality it is very high. some people complain or complained previously that S.M movies are a bit dark but they are playing the movie on their PC not on 1080P HD TV which make a lot of difference.

I personally love S.M rips and use others too but he is my first choice.
When S.M was not around a new name came to the seen like HDLiTE (who was a S.M team member). Also when S.M was around their was 3Li too whom was a new comer (G8 rips but he post them very late)

But all of those are putting movies at a resolution of 1280 x 528

what you are looking for is a 1920x1080 which I am sure will be out at one point. but it will be a big files, about 6G+or even +9GB. The question do really need that resolution? Does it make that difference on your TV? 
you are the only one that can answer that question.
I have HQ Home theater and I download movies at resolution of 1280 x 528 and some of my favorite movies i do go for 1920x1080 or 1920x800, but you have to also look at the bit rate the higher it is the better the quality.
G. Luck buddy and hope that answer your question:)

,falconss,2010-11-19T10:47Z,Makaylah is does not include DVD commentary
,falconss,2010-11-19T10:48Z,"Sorry :)

,shasha2333,2010-11-19T20:23Z,"2007 peers and 8 seeds, real nice guys, way to look out for number no one."
,shasha2333,2010-11-19T20:25Z,I think with 8 seeds and over 2000 peers I'm better off downloading the CBGB and encoding a m-HD version myself. The encode process in Xvid4PSP will sure as hell not take 2 days.
,virdicyer,2010-11-20T02:27Z,"Oh, so S.M. is still too dark eh?  Screw it."
,falconss,2010-11-20T06:36Z,"NO S.M is not dark at all, his rips are even better then before virdicyer. But we are all having lots of hit and run downloads. people that don't like share what they take. I will keep seeding until its seeds = peers. 
cheers"

,shaban96,2010-11-24T18:50Z,thnx alot dude & please keep the dream alive
,devilsylar,2010-11-25T21:40Z,"Do not dowload this.
Audio doesnt work with BS PLAYER, and the subtitle doesnt load on other players...waste of time, thanks :D"
,fillinthisspace,2010-11-28T12:52Z,"devilsylar,
There's no subtitles muxed into the MP4, you need to use the srt subtitle files. VLC Media Player happily uses the subtitles inside the ""subtitle folder"", Media Player Classic needs them moved into the same folder as the video.
Neither of those players has trouble with the audio so your problems are with your setup.

Having said that, like 90% of MP4 torrents the audio/video sync isn't right, so as I do with 90% of the MP4 torrents I download I ran this one through MKVToolnix, added the subtitle files while I was at it, delayed the audio by -150ms (I think) and remuxed the lot as an MKV to end up with a properly synced file.

And of course... this movie is about as excruciatingly tedious to endure as two hours of cinema can get. I was silly enough to watch it after downloading it for someone else and had to keep sticking my leg with a fork to distract myself from the pain of sitting through it."
,fillinthisspace,2010-11-28T13:00Z,"I should add, aside from the slight audio sync issue the quality is pretty good. I don't know why others have complained about it being dark as it looks fine on my computer monitor. The posted screenshots seem to be pretty accurate in terms of the picture quality."
