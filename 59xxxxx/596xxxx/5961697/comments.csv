,jubcomha,2010-11-25T19:40Z,"Sorry, Dude, I was too fast. When you install the serial shows. thanks for the upload, works great!"
,ime021,2010-12-19T12:02Z,"-this is some spam shit...there is 10mb mp3 song in it...do not follow instructions from ""Slickinator.txt"".

-do this instead:

1.extract the downloaded file with winrar in the separate folder.

2.A.browse folders to ""AutoPlay / Docs"" folder where you will find
""bsvideojoiner.exe"" which is installation file.

2.B.Just go to their site and download trial version_it still is 6.34...didnt try this.

3.this is serial extracted from ""AutoPlay / Docs"" folder:

,ime021,2010-12-19T12:11Z,"...and the comment to the ""Slickinator""....
I see that you are active member and that you have many uploads...why would you do something that borderlines with spam-ing.
Uncool man....big no,no...because of things like this people will stay away from your uploads forever and ever....you just dont do things like that...
...thanks for the serial no....cheers"
,MoviesR101,2010-12-25T01:30Z,Thanks For The Up!

Thanks Again Slickinator - Another Great Upload!"
,leetwanker,2011-01-03T11:17Z,"This SEEMS to be some sort of fake, when you run the main executable, which I suspect if I had anti-virus software running, some flags would be popping up right now. So that's my next step. But about the torrent: When you open the main executable, it plays some music and has a few buttons, one of them claims to generate a serial number, nothing to stay install the program itself. 

Point is: I'm staying away from this proposed fake. I suggest you do also, for your own sake. "
,leetwanker,2011-01-03T11:50Z,"To add to my last comment: I've found a torrent which I very much recommend. It seems that gone are the days of having to re-encode videos with different variable bit rates for the audio (VBR) in order for videos to be joined. You now have the option to re-encode the audio right in the program. I haven't fully tested this yet, but it's a huge improvement over the last version I was using. 

Here's a link to this much improved version that seems to be 100% legit!

,nicehs,2011-02-08T21:26Z,"this didnt work for me, kept stopping during install failing to copy a .dll file, maybe my antivir blocked it i dont know.  anyway i whent to the official site and downloaded same version 6.34 and just used the serial that came with this, and that worked.. so guess this is somehow different even though its same version?:s
also i get some warning anyway when trying to launch it after install ""EZMerge.exe tried to execute shellcode as a result of a possible buffer overflow attack"" and is stopped from starting :|"
[V],Slickinator,2011-07-23T15:40Z,there is nothing the matter with it i like to add a song to my installer to give it some fun ....the exe compresses its self so that it is like the mp3 never took any room in the first place and there is no spamming or crap i just enjoy having fun with my torrents if u don't like them don't download i am not hiding anything and for those have have problems with AV's acting up some av's don't like the upx compression of the exe and say its suspiscious trust me its safe all it does its extracts to a temp folder in temp and then after install it dels the extracted files enjoy and trust me its safe ........and enjoy the non spamming music as i will not stop adding it
