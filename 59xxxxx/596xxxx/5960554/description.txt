    With his family struggling to survive in late1890s Norway and his        
    father leaving on a ship for America to earn much needed money,          
    10-year-old Yohan devises some plans of his own to help his family.      
    However, his jealous older brother has other ideas, and, unbeknown to    
    their parents, he signs a contract with an agent for Yohan to become     
    a farm laborer. Now consigned to being a child wanderer, Yohan is        
    sent off to work on a faraway farm providing cheap labor. Yohan          
    embarks on a long, rugged journey filled with danger, loneliness and     
    feelings of abandonment. Along the way, he meets up with two other       
    child wanderers, 8 year-old Anna and her younger brother. Together       
    with other child wanderers and led by the menacing boy Aslak, the        
    group makes its way on foot through the countryside with Yohan           
    finally arriving at the farm where he is told to work. He becomes a      
    shepherd boy, protecting the farmer's livestock from wolves and          
    grizzly bears. His boss, Nome, is a harsh disciplinarian and a tough     
    man to please. Following his heart and with good intentions, Yohan       
    makes decisions that are misunderstood by local adults and are           
    sabotaged by other envious children. Unjustly accused, he is punished    
    and beaten by Nome. Events only get worse, with wild animals             
    attacking Nome's herd on Yohan's watch and Yohan's discovery that his    
    friend Anna and her brother have been beaten at a neighboring farm.      
    Using his resourcefulness and ingenuity, a battered Yohan sets out to    
    help his friend Anna and her brother escape from the farm owners.
