,KURACMASAN,2010-11-20T19:08Z,"I know this is a false positive, but the problem is I CANT GET IT TO OPEN AT ALL!!! Turned off the antivirus and everything, and still wont open! It says I dont have a permission to open this file, even though I ran it as admin (and I am admin on my PC), nothing! PLEASE HELP! Same thing happened with the latest CSI"
,thezeros,2010-11-21T12:52Z,"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fix to crashes: If you have ATI (you can try it with nvidia too, i don't know if it works because i have ATI card) then set AA to ""Application Managed"" I had AA 4x, and now it works.

Some say that setting Affinity to 2 or 1 the game will work but for me it works just bye setting AA to aplication managed so with all 4 CPU's the game is working.
!!!!!!!!!!!"
[V],DeGun,2010-11-21T14:16Z,ADD CRACK TO ANTIVIRUS EXCLUSIONS LIST bunch of noobs
[V],DeGun,2010-11-21T14:18Z,Or else: add to antivirus exclusions list the folder WHERE IS THE ISO FILE . then add this folder to your antivirus EXCLUSIONS LIST then EXTRACT ISO TO THAT SAME FOLDER then crack works.
,Dropastone,2010-11-21T19:46Z,"What's up fellas I have two Nvidia 9500 Gt cards and 2.6 duel core processor. So How do I go about setting up AA to application managed. I'm no noob when it comes to installing these games but I am new to this term.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks."
,Dropastone,2010-11-21T19:50Z,"Also I did set the affinity to two cores, it seemed to work for a min but the game crashed before I could get it out on the track."

,Skaffaman,2010-11-23T16:56Z,@so0os false positive maybeĂÂż but why do u think they make cracks they must be getting  something out of it why else would they make them and that green skull doesn`t mean anything they can still upload virusses and spyware malware other crap even when they are trusted

,BigDonJon,2010-12-16T15:08Z,"virus

he has downloaded this from another person and uploaded only the activator from the game. but little did this weasel know. it has a virus."
,Kyle999,2011-03-26T04:30Z,Works with latest patch 2. If your antivirus/firewall blocked the file just exclude it and run the file again then your good to go. Almost all cracks will claim to be virus. But this one is ok don't worry

,brickedmeat123,2011-10-15T14:32Z,"Okay as VT said about the file...

NOD32: a variant of Win32/Packed.VMProtect.AAD

This means it's compiled/packed with VMProtect. VMProtect is a file compiler which is used to compile a bunch of files or one .vbs file into one single file. The reason NOD32 added this is that the cracked version of VMProtect downloads malicious things without your permission/knowledge. I can't think of it, but I think this file is safe. Just try it."
,brickedmeat123,2011-10-15T14:39Z,"UPDATE:

Tried it out, seems to be fine and doesn't add more files than other, but what I'm confused is where is the key. Other problems that seemed to appear that HP seems to load longer than expected, but it still runs. Somehow if you Alt+Tab your game will epicly slow down. Oh wait, that's just my PC.

K, the file is clean - no serious virus here.

BTW tried this with patch #5 (newest one) and it works well!
Thanks!"
