2008 A Funny Little Cross to Bear  680899501620


2008 release from the Southern Gothic Folk singer and songwriter, a six song collection of 'roadside rarities' recorded live at some of the best indie record stores, radio programs and concert halls across the world. Features 'Stranger Candy', 'Plywood Superman' and 'Jailbird'. Luaka Bop. 2008.

The songs on this live EP came from the solo gigs. If you haven't seen Jim White live, this gives a great snapshot of what a Jim White show is like. He's quite the raconteur, and often tells strange stories between songs. When he tours solo, he uses a small array of electronic and old school gadgets (including a kid's toy keyboard), records samples of himself on the fly, then loops them and layers the loops. By the time the song is done, it often sounds like there are more than just one musician on the stage.
