,Phatfish,2010-11-20T11:39Z,"I first thought he did a pretty good character in the office, but then I realized that he is not actually acting.
He really is a genuine giant wanker. Doesn't necessarily make it any less funny but some of the jokes fall flat when you are aware of this.

Thanks 4 the upload!"
