I searched all night and day for this and finally found it, it works perfectly and I played a bunch of levels on my iPhone 4 before making this torrent and sharing with you guys, since the links on apptrackr are complete bullshit

(they lead to filedude, where you download a rar, which after unpacking contains a txt that has a link to alink, then when you download theipa, its a nonworking copy of street fighter 4 for iphone, bleh, I hate d-bag uploaders)

So here you go, lego harry potter years 1-4 for ios devices!  ;D 

It has fast app switching and retina graphics which look awesome, and its universal, although you can't use it on iPad until the new 4.2 update comes out. There's also a great review on toucharcade, here's a link to the review;

The only issue I had was a purple screen for about half a second when it first booted up, but that may have been normal for uncracked versions of the game too

Seed&Enjoy!
