For years, fans craved an all-blues album from Clapton; he waited until 1994 to    
deliver From the Cradle. The album manages to recreate the ambience of stwar       
electric blues, right down to the bottomless thump of the rhythm section. If it   wasn't for Clapton's labored vocals, everything would be perfect. As long as he plays his guitar, he can't fail -- his solos are white-hot and evocative, original and captivating. When he sings, Clapton loses that sense of originality, choosing to mimic the vocals of the original recordings. At times, his over emotive singing is painful; he doesn't have the strength to pull off Howlin' Wolf's growl or the 
confidence to replicate Muddy Waters' assured phrasing. Yet, whenever he plays, it's easier to forget his vocal shortcomings. Even with its faults, From the Cradle is one of Clapton's finest moments.
