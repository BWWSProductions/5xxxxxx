Finally got it burned by extracting the ISO with WinRAR then burning with Nero 9 on an older NEC burner. My new Optiarc would crap out partway through, burning the ISO or the extracted files. The movie ISO burned fine on the Optiarc with Nero."

The supplemental disc doesn't seem to have anything valid in it.  I've tried Daemon Tools and a couple of other things and can't get anything to recognize it as valid.  Am I missing something?"
,russell1nash,2011-03-02T19:18Z,"Thanx, P4RIAH, for the additional info!"
,dYhA85s,2011-03-07T02:48Z,Many thanks for this incredible movie in the best quality yet available - perfect!
,dYhA85s,2011-03-07T02:49Z,"And oh, the supplemental disc works just perfect (got rid of everything outside the VIDEO_TS folder though) - the documentary seems very interesting!"
,ExAzrael,2011-03-19T03:06Z,"Ahh Yes! A torrent with the supplemental disk!

Does this torrent have the commentary working? The last one i downloaded removed the commentary track :\"
,P4RIAH,2011-07-02T03:28Z,This is a direct copy of the DVDs. Everything that was on the DVDs is included. Including the commentary tracks.
