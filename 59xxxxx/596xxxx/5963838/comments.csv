,nerdpox,2010-11-18T01:18Z,Anyone care to verify this? I'm skeptical of an anon upload. 
,nerdpox,2010-11-18T02:27Z,"ClamXav says it's cleanâŚtread carefully, guys. "
,pReStOn_C,2010-11-18T06:15Z,Uh I thought the release date was for the end of November...? yet 53 Seeders and no comments...?
,gkarma,2010-11-18T14:58Z,ItÂ´s OK.... installed and working on SL 10.6.5
,beserke121,2010-11-23T04:41Z,"It says ""Prior to running an installer, press the patch button to patch hosts file to prevent activation or do it manually (see below)."" Where is the patch? I see the keygen and installer, but where is the patch?"
,jigalou24,2010-11-25T18:30Z,"If no one can verify this, than just use ACR 9."
,iherebob,2010-11-26T14:41Z,"FYI: the patch is within the keygen program i guess...theres a button there if u look carefully.
I installed and it works fine just found 1 problem...i can't find the option to change from color printing to grayscale. Anyone can tell me how to print in grayscale in acrobat x?
i didn't have any trouble printing in grayscale with previous versions"
,thewinchester,2010-12-03T18:26Z,"Happy to vouch for this torrent and contents therein.

Have downloaded this evening, run past F-Secure with no reports of viruses or malware to be found. Application installed perfectly, and the provided keygen generated a valid key first time around. Keygen is stored within a second .dmg file (core_keygen.dmg) contained within the torrent.

No faults found within the version of Acrobat X provided. All major and common features tested, and worked a treat. Advanced features such as document signing, timestamp server use and others also tested, no faults or security issues that I could find.

For those who've not updated their /etc/hosts file to prevent software calling home to Adobe's activation servers, the keygen program also includes a button to do this for you. You will be prompted by the OS for your password, after which it will go and add a single line to /etc/hosts to null route activate.adobe.com.

All in all, a solid torrent and the uploader scores my thanks."
,Un-Danged,2010-12-05T05:45Z,Seems to work fine. Only issue I had was the first DL attempt didn't fully DL Core Keygen. I re-DL it and it seems to work great. Thanks!
,conrad1977,2010-12-05T19:22Z,"Thanks for this - works brilliantly. 

FYI the keymaker and activation blocker works will all CS5 and CS4 products!!! "
,GilR,2010-12-12T20:03Z,Excellent - Thanks!
,niarlttep,2010-12-15T17:08Z,"I found the button ""Patch host file"" on ""CORE Keygen"" and that have add exactly
""
# Block Adobe Activation
127.0.0.1	activate.adobe.com""
to ""~/private/etc/hosts""
Good.
BUT
what's about the Changelog ?
I'm waiting the answer to continue.
Thanks for all, it's wonderfull : I learn a lot of things !"
,Likbez,2010-12-15T17:26Z,"Guys, who knows serial number? Thx"

,mikebon111,2011-01-16T08:07Z,Hello OK sorry if this is a dumb question but Im new to this. I downloaded the file but the keygen app wont launch. Im downloading again so once its downloaded am I supposed to launch the CORE keygen app then install acrobat x and the key wont be required?
,geejay2215,2011-04-07T04:55Z,SOMEONE PUT ACTIVATION CODE HERE!!! 
,mclarenx989,2011-04-26T03:30Z,"1118-0497-5921-8734-9742-0242

,apinujam,2011-05-09T04:08Z,"For those who couldn't open the keygen, most likely it is caused by permission problem. Fix it by running this command from Terminal.app on the download directory

chmod a+x CORE\ Keygen.app/Contents/MacOS/CORE\ Keygen

That will set a proper executable permission bit to the file."
,Dannieloco,2011-05-11T09:54Z,"Guys, this torrent works perfect.
There's no need to use little snitch.

steps to follow
1: download this torrent
2: double click setup.dmg and install Acrobat X Pro
3: double click core_keygen.dmg and click the ""generate""  button. 
4: double click the serial number and it will copy the serial to the clipboard
5: hit the button ""Patch hosts file"" - this will mod the host file and prevent acrobat from calling adobe via the web. This is what little snitch would do.
6: open Acrobat X Pro and paste the serial number and hit next.
7: done! make sure to seed!

,elquenuncahabla,2011-06-04T11:31Z,Has someone tried to update the Application? Does it still works afterwards? I find it a bit slow and hope that the update will make it a bit faster :)
,nemosrings,2011-06-08T22:38Z,"Took 10 mins to download, thanks seeders! Glad to see people seed back instead of 'Hit n Run' letting torrents die quickly. Listening?! I see 82 seeders & 17 seeders, that means hopefully 99 seeders within a day. Don't be such mean miserly pricks & not seed back."
,nemosrings,2011-06-08T22:51Z,"Oops I meant I see 82 peers & 17 seeders. lol Now 14. Hopefully 100 seeders within a short time. Right?

Program works a treat. Updated without issue. And Dannieloco's instructions work well. :)"
,nemosrings,2011-06-08T23:14Z,"lol I must be tired, misread the seeds & peers swapped around."
,josefca,2011-06-10T08:21Z,I have installed Acrobat X Pro in my Mac but I cant see the Maker PDF in my Word 2011 toolbar and of course I cant convert doc files directly from Acrobat. There is any solution?
,Capt_Minus,2011-07-29T20:03Z,"@Dannieloco
steps by Dannieloco worked like charm....
thanks a ton..will keep seeding.."
,Dannieloco,2011-08-29T00:53Z,^^ you're welcome..
,telvet,2011-10-12T01:13Z,"Has anyone tried this with the latest updates? -Does the program work after updating to 10.1.1?
Thanks"
,ANDZER,2012-01-29T01:32Z,"Thanks for the instructions Dannieloco, no problems except where do I find the serial no. ?"

,Smitty57,2012-04-01T01:03Z,"Can someone help explain why Acrobat Pro loads and then closes?  I've downloaded and followed all the instructions.  It appears in my Application folder, but won't stay open.  Noob to Mac world, so apologies."
,kmyassin15,2012-04-04T18:34Z,"fast download. faster installation.. and the keygen worked perfectly...
