,jzenman,2010-11-20T03:23Z,Are you kidding me? What a dumb idea. Have you seen the trailer. This movie sucks so bad I don't even want it for free.

Movie: 4

The script was alright but due to budget, a few bad actors and visual effects this movie did not turn out aswell as it could have."

,sammaful,2010-11-20T18:55Z,shocking film completely hahah the trailer says it all
,michaelrwatson,2010-11-20T22:44Z,"VOMIT, usually you release good stuff, but ripping this piece of shit doesn't do anyone any good. This is the worst movie i've ever seen part of. I don't normally add my opinion on content, but.... a 500ft long CGI sperm whale that can bury itself in the sand, fly over mountains, etc..?  This movie must have been produced by 10-year-olds, with a budget to match.  

Pick any 700MB file at random on piratebay, and it will be more worth your while.

,Loxxster,2010-11-22T01:35Z,"Not one good thing about this piece of shit...not one!!! Definitely lost 15-20 minutes of my life and will be suing for damages. ;)

,thesnowdog98,2010-11-22T03:34Z,"is there something i'm missing? i watched the trailer and even seeing that shit made me realize that i just watched 90 seconds of my life watching it. this movie looks terrible and all the comments say the same yet theres over 3400 seeds and 2500 people that are actually willing to waste their time and energy to watch this steaming pile of sh!t? haha i dont get it, but whatever lol"
,shadow1a,2010-11-22T05:46Z,You guys have no appreciation for the classics
,Trexian66,2010-11-22T06:47Z,"Super good flick! thanks for the upload.

Anyone who grew up in the 70's and watched cheesy flicks like godzilla can appreciate a film like this."
,rae30,2010-11-22T10:14Z,Please don't waste your time.  Why they would make one of the greatest stories of all time into the worst cinamtic diarhea I've ever seen is unbelievable.  I will never get that time back...

,dsgjsd2,2010-11-22T17:41Z,The japanese have some strange grudge against whales (kill em`all and let god sort out the innocent). Sponsored by the japanese department of environment and fishing? 
,kobraone,2010-11-23T03:41Z,LOL This movie is so bad its actually worth watching
,orinvee,2010-11-24T02:12Z,"I watched the trailer...looks like an awesome movie! Looks way better than those stupid Harry Potter movies. Jaws was a really stupid movie. I can't believe Asylum is making better movies than Steven Spielberg. Top notch actors, too. How do they do it on such a small budget?

Of course, I am biased as I had my big roll in the movie...I was the stunt dick."
,rae30,2010-11-24T07:50Z,pure crap

,1971jayman,2010-11-26T12:40Z,"Thanks Bone for the upload... but man... i tell you this movie would have be the worst movie i have every seen... really.. i would even say the grease 2 was better then this.. and that is saying something.. Anyone that grew up watching these type of movies in the 70's well if you can appreciate this film. Then it must help being hard of seeing and hearing.. hmmmmm

,checho_0,2010-11-29T12:32Z,wow I'd watch Troll 2 any day over this. Seriously they made this a movie? Who the fuck makes movies like this? This is a movie trying to be in the 'bad movie/cult classic' genre but it will never make it. That's gotta be the stupidest thing I've ever watched and I'll watch anything. 
,rzainaddin,2010-11-30T18:28Z,Any English subtitle
,gbrowerjr,2011-02-14T21:29Z,lol...you guys couldn't tell by the trailer how bad it was? as a general rule anything below a 3 or above an 8 rating on imdb is gonna be awesome! Granted it doesn't compare to the cult classics but great for b-rated fans. Another great newer one is Zombie Strippers...it stars Jenna Jameson the porn star and the acting is sooo horrible its awesome!!
,Robiliam,2011-03-18T12:00Z,"OMG what a load of crap, I got 30 mins in and had to turn it off......"
,ivandzankic,2011-11-23T13:44Z,"@ .BONE.
Could u please try to find this version of the movie? It's highly rated and it's a one man show with the legendary Jack Aranson.
