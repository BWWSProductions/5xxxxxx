Classic japanese anime film "Lensman" from 1984. Directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri (of Ninja Scroll, Wicked City, Vampire Hunter D fame), and based on the novels of E. E. Doc SMith.

This is the Harmoney Gold version, which has the same voice actors as the streamline dub but is re-made, with edited scenes for children's audience, but with a new and amazing electronic score by Peter Davison. 

This file contains a few of the tracks otherwise made by Michael Bradley included in Robotech: The Sentienals, another US Harmony Gold edit. 

I might add that this is also a TV to VHS rip and does not have the best picture or screen format to say the least, but this edition is very rare and has never, I think, been issued on DVD (even original VHS copies would be hard to find...and so it is the only evidence of the great soundtack and I recommend you watch it just for that if you have already seen it). Enjoy.
