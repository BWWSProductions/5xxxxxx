,splatterpanda,2010-11-25T17:59Z,"great audio and visual quality.

however, lack of subtitles means you'll miss out on some of the aliens' conversations."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-25T22:23Z,has subs.

[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-26T23:19Z,me busy
,koujo92,2010-11-29T11:57Z,what is the duration of this movie?
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-03T16:29Z,16 min longer than last one
,zdude555,2010-12-03T18:40Z,"HolyRoses, the Na'vi parts are not hardcoded with the yellow papyrus font?"
,zdude555,2010-12-03T18:47Z,"Judging from the screencaps, I think the picture is not sharp enough for a 720p rip. Its seems as if it has softened a bit. :'("
,screwju,2010-12-04T01:12Z,im confused. how do i activate the subtitles? an explanation would be much appreciated.
,Cr4y0n,2010-12-05T05:39Z,Tysm this is one of my favourite movies. And can you please upload skyline(handheld)?
,zdude555,2010-12-05T19:23Z,"@screwju
In VLC, just drag & drop the subtitle onto the video. Else put the subtitle file in the same folder as that of the video & rename the subtitle file the same as the video file name.
E.g. in this case the following 2 files should be in the same folder
Avatar Extended (HD).mp4
Avatar Extended (HD).srt"
,osriccc,2010-12-06T17:14Z,"I think 4 Gb is GREAT enough for a 720p 3 hour movie, because if you look the 1080p rips from PS3 Team you'll see almost buray quality (actually I didn't see any differences yet) in 4 Gb 2 hour and little more movies. But... Here I'm being a jerk... This rip, as it has another video file as a source, shows too much artifaction and softened borders. You'll see artifaction in fast camera movements and characters' faces blurry in most parts of the movie where wide and normal lenses are used."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-08T23:53Z,@zdude555 don't need to do any of that.
,sharp182,2011-01-25T18:26Z,"hi holyroses

,kevin456,2012-03-07T17:24Z,man I downloaded this twice and both times I ran this through Handbrake the movie stopped at 41 minutes and wouldn't finish anyone know whats up with that? also I use handbrake bcuz I can't figure out how to get these vids too actually work off my Ext. HD plugged into my 360 bcuz they technically dont work on 360 as is oh and i didn't see any hardcoded subs I dont know if this was another error or what
