With an unmanned, half-mile-long freight train barreling toward a city, a veteran engineer and a young conductor race against the clock to prevent a catastrophe.

Runtime...........:1h 32mn

IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO: Spanish and German videos .......Thanks both 
AUDIO: LU ....Thanks M8ty :)

Ok where to start... well both videos had there faults, but in the end we opted for the body of our encode to be from the spanish one. The spanish one had the end credits missing and also around the hr mark the camera man got the shakes and lost the picture so for these parts we've cut, resized and filtered the german video into our encode. We've also did our normal filtering changing the brightness, contrast, colour etc... Also at the end it comes up with subs that weren't in english so we translated them and hardcoded them to the video. The audio we got off LU which needed to be synced and then muxed to our encode.

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
