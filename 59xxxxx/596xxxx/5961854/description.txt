My friend told me about his new subscription to Demonic3D.com and I just had to get it. He told me I should get a subscription to the site, but I knew better than to pay for it. lol so I just swiped the password from his mail account and downloaded all the videos off the awesome site.

I hope you all don't mind that I converted the files from HUGE AVI files to MP4 files.

The quality should be roughly the same with a much smaller file size.
(I mean really it was like 20MB for an 18 second file)
So i figured I would compress it so you could download it faster ;)
(The original size would have been about 1.2GB)

Hope you all enjoy. I know I did ;)
