    Gather round for a spine-tingling adventure (if you have a spine,       
    that is) unlike any youve ever seen before! Hang on as SpongeBob,       
    Patrick, and the rest of their Bikini Bottom friends dive into           
    SpongeBobs Legends of Bikini Bottom. Youll squirm when Patrick and     
    SpongeBob find themselves held prisoner by a backward gang, SpongeBob    
    and pals look for a way out of the Bikini Bottom Triangle, and an        
    evil hag curses the Krusty Krab! Then laugh when Patrick finds he has    
    lots in common with a monster that invades town, join SpongeBob and      
    Patrick on their search for a drain that once destroyed the city, and    
    brace yourself for a volcanic eruption that brings an ancient warrior    
    with dire predictions to Bikini Bottom!
