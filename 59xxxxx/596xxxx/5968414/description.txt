Plot: BEAUTIFUL THING

ItÂ´s long time summer on a housing estate in South London and the temperature is rising!

Jamie is bunking off school, while his mother, Sandra, juggles job promoition and a relationship with her hippy-dippy painter boyfriend Tony. Next door lives the sassy Leah, who has been kicked out of school and now spends her days listening to mama Cass records. 
Meanwhile, JaimeÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s class-mate Ste, although sporty and popuplar at school, is being bullied by his drunken father at home. One night, Ste seeks refuge in SandraÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s flat and ends ups sleeping head to toe with Jamie.

What develops is a delightful and touching romance between the two boys; from the first nervous glances to the ingenious use of Peppermint Foot Lotion!
