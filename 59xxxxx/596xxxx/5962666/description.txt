Happy Thanksgiving

A family tree with Zeke and Camille Braverman, serving as the patriarch and matriarch. After forty six years of marriage, they\'ve managed to keep their foundation in tact, by burying their emotions underneath the surface for the sake of their now, adult children. Adam, the first born, is the ripest apple the tree has to offer. He runs a sneaker corporation, has a beautiful and supportive wife, two children (boy and girl) and a beautiful home to share with them. He\'s a dog short of The American Dream. Not to mention, he comes highly recommended as the \"go to\" guy. His siblings, comprised of good and bad apples, are Sarah, the unstable daughter, returning home at thirty eight years of age, with her two children, to live with Zeke and Camille. Crosby, the happy bachelor living in the now and on a docked boat, but has a girlfriend pressuring him to have a child. And Julia, the baby Braverman and a successful shot calling lawyer, whose reduced her construction worker husband to \"stay at home dad\" status.
