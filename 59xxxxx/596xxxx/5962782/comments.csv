,Otaku1,2010-11-18T07:13Z,Thank you for this murdoc47. I can only recognize a 2ch audio stream with KMPlayer & VLC also this is a 1080i HDTV rip with the channels watermark visible in the bottom right hand corner throughout the movie.
[T],murdoc47,2010-11-18T19:47Z,"the audio is AC3 5.1 surround, VLC player recognizes is. if not, try the settings in your audio driver (if you have a 5.1 system and if it is set as such).
the watermark is indeed visible, i hope it's not a big deal. it's a great movie!"
[T],murdoc47,2010-11-18T20:06Z,it is AC3 5.1 surround sound. check your settings.
