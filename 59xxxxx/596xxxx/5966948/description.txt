This was a digital tv rip I had which was excellent but very large size.

I encoded to x.264. The video is 1328 x 720 @ 24 fps.

The audio has been replaced with high quality CD audio encoded to .ac3 48 KHz @ 224 kbps.

Excellent and proper rip. There is a small logo as seen in the screen shot.

PS3 and XBOX360 compatible.

Enjoy!
