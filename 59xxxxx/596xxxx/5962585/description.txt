"Sinfonietta Riga" is a new beginning with far-reaching opportunities for quality. Progress can be heard on a daily basis even though it takes time to establish a similar view of the orchestra's style and principles. We are gradually establishing our relationship and exploring styles. It is not easy to form a new orchestra from scratch, as everyone has to adapt - nevertheless, the "Sinfonietta Riga" musicians are driven by a desire to play, and that is what is most important. Youth is fascinating, as it compensates for so many other things - and these young musicians are passionate about what they are doing, without being stuck in a routine. Their energy is infectious and I feel much younger as a result. I enjoy working with these musicians and hope that I am able to do some good by encouraging them not to repeat the mistakes I have made in the past - and that is a fantastic feeling.


Peteris Vasks is a composer with ethical and spiritual convictions. The ethical imperative of his works is that mankind must undertake responsibility for life on earth and for human spirituality. The destruction of nature - virtually the single universal problem of mankind - remains one of his essential themes, but has further developed to become transformed into a universal confrontation between good and evil, the spiritual and the material, between nature and culture, solitude and totality as well as between the worldly and the eternal. Vasks is a man of passion and frankness, and the contradictions of incompatible ethical notions are expressed in the emotional features of his music, which gives us an insight into a fantastic world of nature without borders and limitations.
