I tried running in compatibility mode as well, I can't get it to launch, restarted and everything."
,john6425,2010-11-17T03:06Z,"@jadieg57

You need to mount the iso using Power iso or Daemon tools lite, search google for daemon tools there is a free download on their site

then use it to create a virutal drive and mount, then go to your computer from start and you'll see it underneath the ""c:"" icon under your drives

hope this helps"
,john6425,2010-11-17T03:17Z,"****

Copy the crack to the folder PC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


It wouldn't launch for me because I made a careless mistake. Here is the path to copy it to

C:/Program Files/Electronic Arts/Harry Potter and the deathly hallows Part 1/PC


***In the directory there is a shortcut icon, if you're careless you might delete this and put the new icon there, again put the icon in the folder called PC

The file you are replacing will be 3070KB in size"
,jadieg57,2010-11-17T05:02Z,"@john6425
I have done this. I mounted it using daemon tools, when i double click on it in my computer a command prompt window flashes and goes away and then nothing happens.
then when i right click on the drive and go explore, i double click on EASetup.exe and then it says ""Please insert DVD/CD in Drive D""."
,V0dKa99,2010-11-17T17:36Z,"@john6425
THANK YOU!
was wondering why it refused to launch, copied the exe (if you're using Daemon Tools, find the Razor1911 folder by exploring with File Explorer and copy and paste the HP7.exe file into the PC folder (in Program Files x86/EA or w/e) and voila it works!

glad this has controller options, I'm kind of a console whore so I love being able to use my PS3 controller to play PC games, seems more natural to me)

thanks to the release group too!"

**You will need either PowerIso or ""Daemon tools lite"" to mount the "".iso"" file otherwise you will have to burn this on a disc. Search google for Daemon tools and you can DL from their official site for free. Install either before continuing.


1. DL using uTorrent/Bitcomet/etc
2. Double click on the file and extract the folder ""razor1911"" to the desktop. You can drag and drop it to the desktop as well

3. Mount the image, for Power Iso right-click the file, go to ""Power ISO>Set Number of Drives>1""
4. Right-click the same file again, you will see your new virtual drive under Power Iso it will choose some random letter like ""G"" or ""J"". Ok so Right-click ""Power Iso>Mount Image to Drive [X:] 

5. Then go to: Start>Computer. You will see one of the drives say ""HPDH1"" double-click to install it. No need to instal EA download manager at the end. Use the keys provided or use the keygen.
6. Now you need to find the folder the game installed to, here is the path 

C:/Program Files/Electronic Arts/Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows(TM)/pc

7. Scroll down and look for the Harry Potter icon, it's called hp7 and it's about 3,070 KB in size.
8. Delete that icon but keep the window open

9. Now open the folder you extracted earlier to the desktop called ""Razor1911"" You will see the icon called ""hp7"" right click it and ""COPY""
10. Right click in that window you left open where you just deleted the icon and hit paste. Then click that icon to start the game. You might need to restart."

,dgkresge,2010-12-07T13:56Z,"@axayd
try re-downloading the files again. it's possible that one of the rars are corrupt. also try right clicking on the rar with the .001 or .01 (the first one) and hit extract here. if you get the same error then something's wrong on your end.

@ninoverlas
you need to get a mounting program such as deamon tools (google it and download the free lite version, or torrent a daemon tools) you also need an extracting program such as winrar (also google it) when you have both of those programs, right click on the  rzr-hpdh.001 and a menu should pop up. in that menu there are either 3 or 4 selections that say extract with a purpleish stack of books next to it. hit extract here. when winrar finishes open up ur daemon tools and locate the mount button (depending on which version, it could be different) if its a window program (actually on the desktop) then look for a disc shaped button with either a + or a right arrow (like the play button in windows media player) if its in the task bar then just click on the logo and hit mount. viola, the setup should start up and just run through it.
