Copy the crack to the folder PC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


It wouldn't launch for me because I made a careless mistake. Here is the path to copy it to

C:/Program Files/Electronic Arts/Harry Potter and the deathly hallows Part 1/PC


***In the directory there is a shortcut icon, if you're careless you might delete this and put the new icon there, again put the icon in the folder called PC

The file you are replacing will be 3070KB in size"

,pirategaming,2010-11-17T20:54Z,"I never bitch about seeders...but WHAT THE FUCK.

I've been downloading 12+ hours, with only 5 out of 100 seeders, and I've only downloaded about 4gb, yet I've already uploaded 27gb of this game -.-

Stop leeching you fuckers, we want to play the game too."
,john6425,2010-11-18T02:24Z,"****************Instructions*****************

**You will need either PowerIso or ""Daemon tools lite"" to mount the "".iso"" file otherwise you will have to burn this on a disc. Search google for Daemon tools and you can DL from their official site for free. Install either before continuing.


1. DL using uTorrent/Bitcomet/etc
2. Double click on the file and extract the folder ""razor1911"" to the desktop. You can drag and drop it to the desktop as well

3. Mount the image, for Power Iso right-click the file, go to ""Power ISO>Set Number of Drives>1""
4. Right-click the same file again, you will see your new virtual drive under Power Iso it will choose some random letter like ""G"" or ""J"". Ok so Right-click ""Power Iso>Mount Image to Drive [X:] 

5. Then go to: Start>Computer. You will see one of the drives say ""HPDH1"" double-click to install it. No need to instal EA download manager at the end. Use the keys provided or use the keygen.
6. Now you need to find the folder the game installed to, here is the path 

C:/Program Files/Electronic Arts/Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows(TM)/pc

7. Scroll down and look for the Harry Potter icon, it's called hp7 and it's about 3,070 KB in size.
8. Delete that icon but keep the window open

9. Now open the folder you extracted earlier to the desktop called ""Razor1911"" You will see the icon called ""hp7"" right click it and ""COPY""
10. Right click in that window you left open where you just deleted the icon and hit paste. Then click that icon to start the game. You might need to restart."
