For the last few Harry Potter videogames, the fun has been investigating Hogwarts, mixing up potions, and finding the hundreds of collectables hidden in the halls. In fact, if there was one part that always seemed to be â€œso-so,â€ it was the wand-based combat. It seemed like Harry would just plant his feet, hurl a few incantations, and youâ€™d move on to doing something more fun. Knowing all of that, it was a bit shocking to play the latest Chosen One videogame recently.
