,Swanee1,2010-11-19T18:02Z,"Thanks for the up greenbud1969, your quality is always great.

May I put in a request for a movie released in 1973 called '40 Carats'. Its not available anywhere and it is a very good movie. There was a copy on here that now has no seeders and about 10 leechers at present stuck on 43.5%. The quality probably wouldnt have been as good as yours anyway.

If you can get it it would blow me away!

Thanks Greenbud!"
