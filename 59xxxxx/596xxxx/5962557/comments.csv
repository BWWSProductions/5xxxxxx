video = 10/10
perfect!!
works perfectly in my 40"" SONY HDTV after burning to a blank dvd.. 

it should been much perfect if this is XVID, lol!
so i should no longer need to burn it and just place it on my USB then directly plug to my HOME theater HDTV.

ANYWAY, very much thankful to the uploader.. you're the best!!"
