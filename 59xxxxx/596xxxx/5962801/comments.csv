[V],twentyforty,2010-11-17T20:31Z,"@DMVIN: I've done S1 but I'll do first episode of S2 only - as I explained, some serious cleanup must be done - not because I want to, but because it must be done - current ""program"" is too big for me, to be both encoder and uploader as single person - especially terminally ill one.
