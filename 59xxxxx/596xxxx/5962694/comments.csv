[V],GoodFilms,2010-11-21T12:23Z,original audio (as always) which in this case contains many languages

,terryhenry,2011-06-14T22:19Z,hi all cannot get the subs to work in windows mediaplayer or media player home cinema please help
,iltmatic,2011-07-02T04:32Z,The audio is out of sync with the video! What a disappointment. 
,L0xias,2011-07-25T07:03Z,"Thanks for the upload! the quality is excellent.

Small point of critique: the subs only cover the non-english parts and even than they're sometimes missing.

@iltmatic
Nope. Must be you. I just watched the first episode and the audio wasn't out of synch anywhere."
