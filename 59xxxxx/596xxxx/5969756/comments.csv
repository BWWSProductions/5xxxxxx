,liimujx,2010-11-23T23:37Z,what exactly does this torrent do? and how do u use it? sorry i'm kind of a noob at this stuff
,GreyHaven1,2010-11-24T21:25Z,"Ugh, this is soo annoying. I activate it (press insert after zombie map has loaded) and it shows no indication what so ever that the damn thing is even responding to what I'm doing. Then, if I press num key 1 for the unlimited health the program disappears, shuts it's self down. I don't want to go ahead and say this doesn't work, because there is a chance that I might be doing something wrong, but I will say that it's bullshit that I have tried just about everything to get it working and still nothing yet."
,GreyHaven1,2010-11-24T23:41Z,"Well, I got it working some what. Not everything works, in fact the only thing I could mange to get working was num key 6. This does NOT improve the game's performance in anyway. Crashed my shit twice. I stopped using it, no crashing. So, personally I think it's a waste of time, but maybe others have had/will have better luck than I."
