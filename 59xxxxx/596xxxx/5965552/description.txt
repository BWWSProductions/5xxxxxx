As a student of Music, listening to Sleigh Bells I was blown away. Their mixes of House (Club), Hip-Hop, and Pop are amazing. I noticed a few of their songs had spaces with no vocals on them. I thought of the idea on Thursday and finished the EP on Sunday night. Thank You to Sleigh Bells and artists like them that continue to push the envelope and create great music.
