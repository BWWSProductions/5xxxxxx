1.  Introduction

     You have just finished your years as a student  at  the
local  fighter's  guild.   After much practice and sweat you
have finally completed your training and are ready to embark
upon  a  perilous  adventure.  As a test of your skills, the
local guildmasters have sent you into the Dungeons of  Doom.
Your  task  is  to  return  with the Amulet of Yendor.  Your
reward for the completion  of  this  task  will  be  a  full
membership  in the local guild, plus you are allowed to keep
all the loot you bring back from the dungeons.

     In preparation for  your  journey,  you  are  given  an
enchanted  sword, taken from a dragon's hoard in the far off
Dark Mountains.  You are  also  outfitted  with  elf-crafted
armor  and given enough food to reach the dungeons.  You say
goodbye to family and friends for what may be the last  time
and head up the road.

     You set out on your  way  to  the  dungeons  and  after
several days of uneventful travel, you see the ancient ruins
that mark the entrance to the Dungeons of Doom.  It is  late
at  night  so  you  make  camp at the entrance and spend the
night sleeping under the open skies.   In  the  morning  you
gather  your  sword,  put  on your armor, eat what is almost
your last food and enter the dungeons.
