ITS SHITTY JOINT STEREO
g8aso DONT EVER diss my uploads again people like you make me sick all the comments you have left on TPB and Demoniod and you have the nerve to upload a torrent in joint stereo which seems to be something you hate if anybody else uploades it. 

IN FUTURE KEEP IT SHUT. 

You are UNBELIVABLE LOL. PMSL"
[T],seanprince2,2010-12-10T17:48Z,Say something for fucks sake you idiot .
,foty1,2011-01-08T06:49Z,"Thanks for this, saw the BBC2 show she was on, needs a good seeing to!

Take no notice of that dick head, he can't tell the difference between an  audio file and a video!

Any more Beckii? "
[T],seanprince2,2011-01-11T19:12Z,"@ foty1 what are you talking about



Take no notice of that dick head, he can't tell the difference between an audio file and a video!


i do know the difference this is clearly a music video if you downloaded it  you would know that it is a music video with joint stereo sound which is something that  g8aso is not a fan of at all. lol"
,scottsasse,2011-02-02T18:22Z,"g8aso, it looks like you might just be a dumb-ass like ""seanprince2"" indicates in his comments!!!! WHY and WHAT was your point in commenting simply ""1987"" on my Fat Boys torrent yesterday???????? Are you trying to diss me or correct me?? The year 1987 is CLEARLY marked on the CD that I ripped it from (I just re-checked it). If by CHANCE both me and Polygram Records are both wrong then show me PROOF and accept my apology, otherwise FUCK OFF and STOP using TPB!!!!!!!!!!!!  "
[T],seanprince2,2011-03-29T02:52Z,"See no one likes you !!!! just FUCK OFF, ARSE"
