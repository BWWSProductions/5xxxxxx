,xads308,2010-11-18T04:47Z,"so, can i put the video right on a psp, or do i need to convert it in some way (like to MP4)? could i just rename the file extension as .mp4? btw, nice upload. thanks a bunch >:)"
,nhprm,2010-11-18T05:56Z,@xada - Just drag movie to Video folder on PSP when used in USB mode.  Easy peazy.
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-18T06:10Z,you don't need to do anything.  copy the folder as is to your PSP in the /VIDEO folder.

,smasudi,2010-11-19T17:25Z,please upload INCEPTION for PSP also...
,xads308,2010-11-20T03:52Z,"alright, i was watching this on my psp (great quality, by the way) and when they started speaking na'vi, there were no subtitles. how to i put the included .srt files onto the movie?"
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-20T16:06Z,Petition Sony to support soft subs like the ipod touch.  If that fails then you will have to re-encode with an app that supports burning of subtitles into the video stream.
,omegastoo,2010-11-20T18:50Z,"@ HR thanks for the upload, but just an fyi I think that if the subs are softcoded and wont run on psp then you shouldn't put psp in the file title. OOO's upload had the same problem, I saw you'd ul'd AVATER DC and thought ""great one with the navi subs"" but have been disappointed. yes you can re-encode the subs in but then its going against the point of downloading an already psp coded file. you might as well just have just dl an avi and coded them into that."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-21T00:33Z,the file technically runs fine.

Well yes the ENGLISH bits do.

Perhaps the torrent should have been labelled

Avatar Extended (PSP if you can speak Navi, iPod, Zune) "
,squidney2k1,2010-12-21T05:31Z,Subs for the Navi aren't hardcoded??
,wellhellothere13,2011-02-18T04:34Z,lovely :) thanksss
,Dermbet,2011-07-30T01:57Z,thanks dude
,k121op,2011-08-29T20:43Z,pls encode subtitles into videos in future....
