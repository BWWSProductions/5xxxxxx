,xkshitizx,2010-12-12T08:43Z,"hello guys , i have a question for you..
which one is better in terms of quality , this 720p version by aoloffline or 1080p version

i have seen the sample of 1080p and 720p screenshot .. i find 720p version better .. 

please reply this one"

1080p is the best you can get at the moment for any movie but if u see a 720p that looks like its better then the 1080p then the 1080p is probly a fake

1080p movies are usually around 10GB

doesnt matter if who it was uploaded by.

i didnt see any 1080p versions of this (but i just look at the torrents with the most seeds so i probly missed them)

hope this helped

i mean the The.Twilight.Saga.Eclipse.1080p.Bluray.x264-CBGB
