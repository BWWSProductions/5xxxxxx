Dara O Briain This is the Show was recorded in front 
of a sell out crowd on the final date of his record 
breaking nine nights at the world famous Hammersmith 
Apollo.

Dara is on top form as he effortlessly mixes off the 
cuff audience interaction with razor sharp material 
and a star studded finale that almost puts Hollywood 
to shame.
