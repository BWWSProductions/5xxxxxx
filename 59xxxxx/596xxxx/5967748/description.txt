[Chorus]
Im about to lose my mind
Youâ€™ve been gone for so long
Iâ€™m running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Eminem]
I told the World one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I donâ€™t even know if I would leave it when Iâ€™m saying that
Yaâ€™ll start to creep in, everyday its so grey and black
Hope I just need a ray of that
Cause no one seeâ€™s my vision when I play it for em
They just say its wack
Thye donâ€™t know what dope is
And I donâ€™t know if I was awake or asleep
When I wrote this,
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breeding life in me
I owe my life to you
Before the life of me, I dont see why you dont see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
See this light in you, itâ€™s dark. let me turn on the lights and brigthen me and lighten you
I dont think you realise what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick
You gon either wanna fight me when I get off this f-cking mic
Or you gon hug me
But Iâ€™m not an option, theres nothing else I can do causeâ€¦

[Chorus]
Im about to lose my mind
Youâ€™ve been gone for so long
Iâ€™m running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Eminem]
It hurts when I see you struggle
You come to me with ideas
You say there pieces so Iâ€™m puzzled
Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But your either getting lazy or you donâ€™t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Cant make a decision keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and its almost like your begging for my help
Like Iâ€™m your leader
Your susposed to be my f-cking mentor
I can endure no more,
I demand you remember who you are
It was YOU, who believed in me

When everyone was telling you dont sign me
Everyone at the f-cking label, lets tell the truth
You risked your career for me
I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to f-ck with the white boy
Thats why Iâ€™m crying in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe its my time to save yours
But I can never repay you what you did for me is way more
But I aint giving up faith and you aint giving up on me
Get up Dre, Iâ€™m dying I need you, for f-cks sake

[Chorus]
Im about to lose my mind
Youâ€™ve been gone for so long
Iâ€™m running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

(I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life)

[Dr Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit
Whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on
But they just left, they said was riding to a death
But where the f-ck are they now
Now that I need them I dont see none of them
All I see is Slim
F-ck all you fair-weather friends
All I need is him
F-cking backstabbers
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you bout to feel the wrath of aftermath, faggots
You gon see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the f-ck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots and the crackers ass
Little crack a jack beat making wack math,
Backwards producers, Im back bastards
One more CD and then Iâ€™m packing up my bags and as Iâ€™m leaving again
Iâ€™ll guarantee they scream Dre donâ€™t leave us like that man causeâ€¦

[Chorus]
Im about to lose my mind
Youâ€™ve been gone for so long
Iâ€™m running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
