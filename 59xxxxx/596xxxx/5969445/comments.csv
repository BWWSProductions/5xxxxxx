,monkilis,2010-11-21T07:11Z,"Open your eyes and be slightly curious.  You will soon find out that there are 543 files in this torrent.  Look closer and you will see that it is a link to a full listing.

Or you could just dl the torrent itself.  Cannot think of a program that won't let you see the contents of a torrent.

Something tells me you should dl this either way.  Stupidity is a disease that can be cured.  Iacocca once said ""The secret of success is hard work.  That's why it will remain a secret""."
,qwertzo99,2010-11-21T14:36Z,"Did anyone scan this torrent for virii, trojans, worms, etc. I'm usually little sceptic about Anonymous uploaders. "

- the image is 1.5MB. I didn't downloaded any, so I don't know if there's trojans around those files, but the list is here :)

and I'm sorry about my bad English"
