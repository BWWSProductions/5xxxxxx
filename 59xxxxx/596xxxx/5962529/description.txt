Blondie - Hanging on the Telephone [TopPop Golden Years 1978].VOB



HQ rare tv show promo. AVRO's TopPop The Golden Years was a Dutch television program that, between 2008 and 2009, was broadcast via Netherlands 3 NPS. TopPop Golden Years brings back unique archival material from legendary TopPop broadcasts. 

The series consisted of thirty minute episodes with clips from the original TopPop television program from the 70s and 80s. The broadcasts were built around themes from disco to funk, from glasses and mustaches to eroticism and from reggae to rock.

The original TopPop presenter Ad Visser has a very brief cameo beside the clip window. The clips have a few temporary trivia text bars at the bottom of the screen in dutch. There is also a small white "n p s" text to the top left, and a small green box to the top right, both outside of the clip window. 

"Hanging on the Telephone" is a song written by Jack Lee and first performed by Lee's short-lived US West Coast power pop trio The Nerves, who placed it as the lead-off track on their 1976 EP, the band's only release. 

New Wave band Blondie popularised the song when it was released as the second single off Parallel Lines in both the U.S. and the UK, eventually reaching number 5 in the UK in November 1978 as well as inspiring other cover versions.
