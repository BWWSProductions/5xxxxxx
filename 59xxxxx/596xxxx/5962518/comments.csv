,yopepoy,2010-11-17T14:47Z,this is the only twilight i like. thanks mate!
,shasha2333,2010-11-17T16:15Z,"I almost downloaded this, i would if it had a slightly higher video bitrate, like 2000kbps or so instead of 1500kbps, at that bitrate I might as well get the brrip xvid, still searching for a worthy m-HD version."
,yopepoy,2010-11-17T17:19Z,i think 1500kbps h264 is still better than 2000kbps xvid.
,moshster,2010-11-17T18:42Z,"I agree, x264 lower bit rate beats XviD at slightly higher bit rate."
,fakebest,2010-11-17T21:20Z,bitrte is not a good comparison of quality this could be even lower bitrate and look just like the original 720p it all depends on the settings used. Feel-Free usually does a good job in size to quality ratio so unless you actually downloaded this and saw the quality then you shouldn't say such uninformed things.

,dino_chavez,2010-11-20T03:38Z,"WARNING: For all the HD junkies searching for a good copy, do not download this one. The movie looks great in most parts, but in the big battle near the end the movie tends to stutter or looking almost like a slight slow motion maybe due to the fast action. Sorry to the uploader"
