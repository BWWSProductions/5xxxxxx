Made from a DVD source which had great video, but for some reason, had very poor .mp2 160 kbps audio.

So I re-encoded the video while cropping the black areas to .264.

I replaced the audio from CD Audio and that was encoded to .ac3 at 224 kbps 48 KHz.

The video is 700 x 336, 29.97 fps Progressive. (I use my personal and special enhancing de-interlacing tricks.)

All in all, this rip is so much better than the original DVD!

Fully PS3 and XBOX360 compatible.

Enjoy!
