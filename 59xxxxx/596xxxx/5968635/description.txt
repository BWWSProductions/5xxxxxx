Starring
Ryan Reynolds

Set in 2006 in Iraq, Paul Conroy, a US truck driver, awakens buried alive, bound and gagged, with only a Zippo and a mobile phone. [8] Although he initially has no idea as to how he got there, he soon starts to piece together what has happened to him.[9] Gradually, Paul remembers that he and several other convoys were ambushed by insurgents, then all the other truck drivers were killed shortly before he blacked out. After finding the cellphone, Paul attempts to get into contact with his wife and his employers (who gave him a safety number if anything like this should occur) but is able only to leave a message for both of them. Paul is able to get into contact with the FBI, but they cut off before he can explain the situation. However, he is able to determine from the questions the FBI official asked him that he has been kidnapped. The kidnapper contacts him and demands a ransom of $5m to be released alive, but this is then lowered to $1m.
