"Temporary Monsanity"

Todd (Ben Rappaport) begins feeling 
pressure from his family to succeed, so he 
tries to impress them by winning a Black 
Friday sales competition. Fearing defeat, 
Todd works his employees extra hard, only 
to find his efforts thwarted when the 
power goes out due to a torrential 
downpour. Meanwhile, Charlie (Diedrich 
Bader) tries to redeem himself after 
losing to Manmeet (Sacha Dhawan) and Gupta 
(Parvesh Cheena) at the Indian version of 
billiards by challenging them to a game of 
laser tag.

Enjoy :)
