Modern Painters is the definitive international source for analysis of 
contemporary art and culture â€“ from painting and sculpture to photography, 
film, architecture, design and performance. Visually dynamic artwork with 
fresh, incisive writing that is above all accessible.

Enjoy."

We are just providing spilt cargo for the treasure seekers to dive on. But soon even that will be gone. Its a real shame coz a few uploaders have put a hell of a lot of effort in keeping this site going. My hat off to those uploaders and lets hope they get their reward on the darkside. Enjoy while you can people."
