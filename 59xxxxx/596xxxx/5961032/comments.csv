,micnor14,2011-03-01T02:46Z,Thanks for the heads up Alainfigue and JCass3383!!! But wich torrent then...?
,gaaraisgod,2011-03-14T06:21Z,"Thanks alainfigue & JCass3383 :)

For some reason, 256 is a weird bitrate. At least on my system, 192 and then 320 play perfectly but any other bitrate sounds low quality O_o"
,mad_maxine,2011-10-08T21:43Z,"Bitrates should never be trusted. A constant bitrate of 320 is great if the tracks were ripped direct from CD. But what if the original track were already encoded at a lower bitrate, or in a different encoding method? Re-encoding at a higher bitrate will not recover what is already lost, and will actually incur more loss."
