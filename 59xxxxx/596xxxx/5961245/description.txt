"The Spotnicks in Paris was the group's second album, recorded and released in 1963. It became quite successful in those days, and if you look at it today, you'll find a number of further timeless and still demanded tracks on it: 'Just Listen To My Heart', coupled with 'Pony Express' reached No. 23 on thecharts in 1963. 'Le Dernier Train De Lâ€™espace' became a huge success in Japan around 1965 (and was covered by the American guitar-band 'Ventures' in 1979). 'Happy Guitar' went successful in France and 'Last Date' is another highlight which is featured in the band's concerts since its release. This CD also includes several interesting additional tracks such as the old English traditional 'My Bonnie' (also used for their appearance in the English movie 'Just for Fun'), the classic 'Johnny Guitar', still alive and unforgettable, and 'Old Clock At Home', an old Swedish traditional. These bonus tracks were mostly recorded at Bo Winberg's home, by using his own self-built equipment. This music don't have the over-perfection of today's productions - but it features what we call handmade, clear and powerful, nostalgic,
but surely not old-fashionedâ€
