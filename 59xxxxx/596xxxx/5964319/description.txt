"Ballona Creek"

When Department of Public Works employee Don 
Heller (guest star Dan Kinsella) is found 
stabbed to death, the detectives suspect those 
responsible are the gang bangers he encountered 
earlier that day. However, the case takes a 
significant turn when Winters and Jarzuszalski 
discover that Heller was investigating a string 
of unsolved murders that were committed over 
the past decade. DDA's Dekker (Terrence Howard) 
and Stanton (Megan Boone) must now seek justice 
for the innocent victims in hopes to erase the 
horror from the past.

Enjoy :)
