flowers in the pavement-
evolution,
creepy,
rubbed the lamp the wrong way,
vagina ice,
clean the tub,
pigs in the porn trough,
i love you but......,
the tunnel of love,
greenhouse,
supermarket chick,
get amongst it,
this is for you,
headless princess,
hip hop blues,
twisted road,
weatherman,
watchdog water dragons,
flowers in the pavement album art.

day of the dog-
the dreamer,
its working,
up jumped the boogie,
then till now,
coppin' it sweet,
get your boof on,
get loose,
mad tight,
nowhere but up,
watch your mouth,
party at my place,
evening breeze,
that feeling,
lights camera action,
soldier on,
good morning Australia,
worldwide,
blazin',
them boys,
day of the dog album art.

flying colours- includes tracks off bonus disc,
the beginning,
woodstock 2008,
eye of the storm,
bullet and a target,
happy in my hoody,
destiny lane,
zion bash,
the sea is rising,
gorilla militia,
how to listen part 1,
climb these cliffs,
at midnight,
royal flush,
$5 steak,
the truth,
never give up,
field of dreams,
lonely streets,
mexican spit fire,
choof choof train,
flying colours album art.

running on air-
never land,
flying through the city,
addicted,
down by the river,
the moses twist,
art house audio,
family affair,
reflections,
coastal kids,
people up on it,
caught at the pub,
where the wild things are,
the children of the night,
smoke like a fire,
re-debating reality,
late one night,
j can,
weightless wings,
golden years,
running on air album art.


PEACE, LOVE and UNITY!
