'Watch that, tell you that... Racial pride is a cancer. Prejudice is a disaster. These are ways and means to divide the people, yeah! Racism is a catastrophe, reviving hate and partiality... Why must you go through life, bounded by your hate and strife. Love for you is a life for I... Why can't we come together and unite, got to, cause people are people.'



Yes from creation all mankind come from Africa, seen?



One Love!
