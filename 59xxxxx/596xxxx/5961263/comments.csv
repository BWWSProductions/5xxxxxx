,Helmet507,2010-12-03T15:29Z,"my girlfriend loves this shit, thanks for getting me laid!"
,spanky215,2010-12-04T21:55Z,"This is a good movie, just a little ""chicky"". Just ignore the children with the flame comments, they're not mature enough to realize that we all like different things and hopefully someday they'll grow up and stop being punks."
,Krimsonhascake,2010-12-05T06:35Z,@ hacker4life   well if twilights gay then you must be as well for looking up the torrent and commenting on it duh thanks for the up keep up the good work
,LadyShiel,2010-12-05T10:00Z,"@Hacker4Life, we don't need your insults. If anybody's supposed to be referred to as F* retarded, it should YOU. Leave the people alone who want to enjoy this movie. Constructive criticisms on movies is what we need, NOT children who are too frustrated with their lives that they annoy others just to get even. Thanks for the upload."
,nuala666,2010-12-06T20:17Z,thanks raymound 
,patientpaws,2010-12-07T00:34Z,"@Hacker4Life...
Really? Get a job and stop spamming torrents.

You only know they sparkle because you've paid attention, so.. you're ""dumb as dog shit"" too. :)"

,landahoy,2010-12-07T23:43Z,"Don't know why I wanted to watch this one because I knew it was going to suck like the other two. 
Whatever. 
Thank you, as always, for the up so my-instant-gratification-for-viewing-self could watch it!"
,Listerlnx,2010-12-12T05:01Z,"Twilight really is fucking stupid. Full of plot holes and written by an amateur author who knows CHILDREN OF ALL AGES would eat this shit up. It's fucking stupid. Edward may not have aged physically, but he aged mentally. pedophelia much, kids? I think so lol. This chick has a sick mind, or a small one.

And also... If a person is solid, and breaks like glass, how can they create sperm?"
,noirelion,2010-12-12T14:48Z,"Why do people who don't like a movie- or hate the plot or book feel the need to tell us? If it was so bad why are you here? To prove you are a doushebag? We already know.. 
Meyer(s) wrote a good series people like me liked em- if you dont like em- well wtf are you doing here? Good up.
Haters.... you look like a nutass... on a torrent site for a movie you profess to hate- yet know so much about... I think you are just in a pathetic search for attn- any attn.. its just obvious."

,Superfrasse,2011-05-21T00:13Z,"Okay, so I'm just typing some words for you who think about downloading this movie, first I'm just going to say that I couldn't find the first part of this triology here on pirate bay, because all the retards just keep uploading this one; eclipse, all the frickin' time, just more and more, when this torrent is the one with the most seeders... I don't get why you'd choose another one.
Great torrent, though..; raymondhome. ^-^
Okay, to the point:
To all of you who haven't seen any part of the twilight triology:
-You want get a shit; something attacks a random teenager guy on the street, then Bella and Edward sits and shine in the sunlight...

To all of you who have seen thesemovies but just want them downloaded to keep because you think they are good:
-Edward Cullen (or ho it's spelled) is freaking shining in the sunlight! They aren't different than trolls in sunlight, they turn into ashes!


I could personally not stand more than 10 minutes of this movie.
I call bad.
Please don't hate me because I'm telling my opinion, and even if you actually type anything for me to answer or get mad at, I can tell you that I will most likely NOT return.

Great torrent, though.
Good quality.
Really awesome speed, thanks! :D"
