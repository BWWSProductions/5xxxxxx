Bit of a shame -- you don't get to hear the live performance.  The audio is simply a cut from the studio version.

I get the feeling it isn't a case of lip-synching.  It looks like they were really performing, and then somewhere along the way, the studio version was dubbed in its place.  It makes me wonder who's hiding the actual live performance audio.

And to top it off, it was mellow camerawork, with some good shots of the rhythm guitar.  I really wanted to see him play...

And that's the way it was in 1979.

2 mins 52 secs.
MPEG2 720x576, 25 fps, 6790 kbps,
stereo, 256 kbps.  If only.

For true funkadelia, I recommend torrent ""Chic - The Best Of Chic 1991 TQMP [FLAC]""  On the [audio] album, Le Freak is 5 mins 31 secs."
