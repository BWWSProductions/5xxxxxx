Chic - Le Freak [TopPop Golden Years 1979].VOB



HQ rare tv show promo. AVRO's TopPop The Golden Years was a Dutch television program that, between 2008 and 2009, was broadcast via Netherlands 3 NPS. TopPop The Golden Years brings back unique archival material from legendary TopPop broadcasts. 

The series consisted of thirty minute episodes with clips from the original TopPop television program from the 70s and 80s. The broadcasts were built around themes from disco to funk, from glasses and mustaches to eroticism and from reggae to rock.

The original TopPop presenter Ad Visser has a very brief cameo beside the clip window. The clips have a few temporary trivia text bars at the bottom of the screen in dutch. There is also a small white "n p s" text to the top left, and a small green box to the top right, both outside of the clip window. 

"Le Freak" is a 1978 hit disco song by Chic. It was the band's third single and first Billboard Hot 100 and sole number-one song. A New York Times critic describes the song as a "haunting, minimalist pop-funk built around the guitar and bass". 

Along with the tracks, "I Want Your Love" and "Chic Cheer", "Le Freak" stayed at number one on the disco charts for seven weeks. The single bears the distinction of being the highest selling record ever on Atlantic Records, and the highest-selling single ever on WEA until it was displaced in 1990 (by Madonna's "Vogue").

The single achieved sales of over four million and also reached number seven in the UK singles chart.

The song was ranked at number 19 on Billboard Magazine's top 100 songs of the first 50 years of the Hot 100 chart.
