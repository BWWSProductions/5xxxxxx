720x304 resolution is not HD, fool.  This movie looks like a bad video game.

For your information, 1280x720 is the bare minimum HD resolution (720p).

What a waste of fickin' time."

,meowdog,2011-05-17T09:43Z,"to solve sound, you have to select audio options in your movie player and turn off 5.1 if you are using stereo 2 way. this will allow all sounds to come out of the two tweeters. voices are always on the two rear and center in 5.1"
