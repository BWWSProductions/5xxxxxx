"One" is a song by American singer-songwriter Sky Ferreira taken from her upcoming debut album. The song was released on August 23, 2010, as the first European single from the album.

The music is directed by photographer Rankin and was released to the Parlophone YouTube channel on 2 July, 2010. The scenes are mostly close-ups of Ferreira in a red outfit on a flashing floor, singing into a shadeless lamp in a white room, jumping in slow motion, and pulling on a white parachute.

"One" was written by Sky Ferreira and Marit Bergman in less than 30 minutes. and produced by Bloodshy & Avant, responsible forSpears hits such as "Toxic", "Piece of Me" and "Radar". Sky described the song's meaning as "being numb and wanting to feel love, happiness, sadnessâ€”anything, really. Itâ€™s kind of like the Tin Man wanting a heart." In an interview with DigitalSpy, Sky further explained the meaning behind "One" as "It's about being in a relationship where you're ignored - any type of relationship, not necessarily romantic. It's about that point where you don't feel anything - you don't feel happy, you don't feel sad, but you want to feel something... There's always someone in a relationship who wants more attention and starts trying too hard to please the other person. The thing is, the more you try to please that person, the less effort they make because they know you'll do anything they want. It's that stage I'm singing about on 'One'."

"One" entered the UK Singles Chart on August 29, 2010 at #64.
