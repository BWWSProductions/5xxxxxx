I wanted to ask about the audio.  The file works great, no complaints here.  But I have a very basic tv and dvd player, not a home theater; so the audio of the music, explosions, special FX, etc sound louder than the voices of the characters.  I'm guessing it's because I don't have the extra speakers but I wanted to make sure.  So if anybody can comment on the audio, I would be really greatful, thanx.   "
