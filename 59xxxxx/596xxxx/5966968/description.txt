More than money is at stake as Michael (Golden 
Globe winner Steve Carell) helps charm people 
into investing in Ryan's (B.J. Novak) internet 
company. Dwight (Rainn Wilson) capitalizes on 
both the Thanksgiving holiday and his 
childhood memories by creating a hay festival 
in the parking lot, while Jim (John Krasinski) 
discovers that a new Dunder Mifflin policy 
prevents him from earning commission.

To everyone who complained about having to
buy iTunes last week jsut to get a watchable
copy (like we did) - complain to the morons
who jsut refuse to encode these properly and 
continue putting out releases that look worse 
than the 720p xvids of yore.

Enjoy :)
