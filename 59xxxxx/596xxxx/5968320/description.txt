[Spraff]

Comedian, writer and actor, whose stand-up is 
full of surrealism, nonsense and sharp wit. 

Milton Jones' style is a quick-fire barrage of 
one-liners delivered with a goggle-eyed stare. 

He has performed regularly for Radio 4 and his 
three series of The Very World Of Milton Jones won 
a Sony Radio Award. 

He was the winner of the Perrier Best Newcomer Award 
in 1996, and was subsequently nominated for the main 
prize. He received the Time Out 'Best Comedy Performer' 
prize in 2003 and has been nominated for the
Comedy Awards.

A comedy legend and one of the funniest men in the 
country.
