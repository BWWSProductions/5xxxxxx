Full Release Title : The Bad Lieutenant - Port Of Call New Orleans 2009 720p BRRip XviD AC3-SceneUnderground

Storyline In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Terence McDonagh (Nicholas Cage) is awarded a bittersweet promotion to Lieutenant within his local precinct, for a seemingly heroic action which left him crippled by back pain. Prowling the streets day and night, McDonagh's riddled with internal conflict over his increasing addiction to any drug he can get his hands on, his duty to uphold the law, a misguided relationship with a high-class prostitute (Eva Mendes), and a laundry list of other life stressors. In the background of his continuous downward spiral, McDonagh's been assigned to a case involving the ritualistic killing of five victims caught in a local drug war. Knowing he has little evidence to go on, the boundary-pushing Lieutenant embarks on a precarious manhunt that takes him even further down his cocaine-laden rabbit hole, as he steps head first into the land of compromise and self-indulgence.
