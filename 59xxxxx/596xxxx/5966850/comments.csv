,arjun_519,2010-11-19T17:39Z,"Thanks a lot...
a thought crossed my mind just now.

Why dont u put names of upcoming and released torrents of urs in the nfo or in extra notes part(only if that doesnt create some problems...).That way people will wait and stick to the site[:)].
I have seen this practice with some releasers in p2p comm..i think its good that way..."

,tekromancr,2010-12-23T20:32Z,"@pv2depoty2010 and @spydrz - I just got a ""Notice of Action under the DMCA"" from Comcast for this. Oddly, neither I nor my officemate have ever downloaded any of the Shrek films, and the ip they claim is ours is one we've never had. Called up and asked about it, the response was an adamant ""No, you downloaded it and that was your ip, your problem now."" One more and they cut our connection. Beware of this one..."
,hbft,2010-12-24T22:32Z,I got a letter from Comcast with Notice of Claim of Copyright Infringement!!!
