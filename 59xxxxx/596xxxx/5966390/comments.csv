You choose, I will seed both."
,dr-johan,2010-11-21T11:37Z,"I have tried to edit the torrent info, but I am not able to save it.

The ISO has Chinese (Cantonese) and English audio, English (and Netherlands?) subtitles.

Only one peer downloading so far, but I will keep seeding at least one copy."
,dr-johan,2010-11-23T17:39Z,"If you are downloading this, just keep at it.

I am seeding even if TPB does not show it, and most of the time you get my maximum speed, 60 kb/s. (At least it is available for you...)

I have no intention of leaving anyone with half the download and as long as I am the only seeder I will keep seeding."
