,Whoa666,2010-11-22T17:18Z,"What happened?

Launching the ""offline"" game server emulator - 'sudo' may ask you for your password.
(Leave it running while playing the game, hit ctrl+c when you're done.)

/Users/robby/Documents/Download/offserv/03_run_server.command: line 16: cd: /Users/robby/server: No such file or directory
python: can't open file './tserver.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory

Press any key to continue...

Pls pm me on what I'm doing wrong."
,Croissants,2011-01-10T05:57Z,"I got the same dead end.
Worst thing is that the launch message tells me that I don't have an internet connection (means that I can't reach the ""buy online""step). How do I uninstall it?"
,thapheon1,2011-01-10T14:21Z,"If it doesnt work for you, then read the instructions over again, and understand it. If you dont understand the instructions. Then unlucky for you. If it doesnt work at any way, then unlucky for you. If you have 10.5.x, then unlucky for you."
,Croissants,2011-01-10T14:55Z,"Well I followed the instructions (very simple and straight, can't really miss it) and I'm using 10.6.6 but no matter what it says that i don't have an internet connection. My question right now is very simple: how do I uninstall it?"
,thapheon1,2011-01-18T17:12Z,"/Users/robby/server

You dont have that directory. Put the server emulator in /Users/robby/

And then try again."
,bigboss23,2011-03-04T19:50Z,heyy is their any way to undo these without uninstalling and reinstalling the entire game?
,hjafri12,2011-08-22T04:48Z,"Hi, i used this crack for the game, and all the characters are red and green with the blood being green. Why is this happening?"
