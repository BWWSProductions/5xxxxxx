Starring Dick Van Dyke, Sally Ann Howes, Lionel Jeffries.

Dick Van Dyke stars as quirky inventor Caractacus Potts, whose magical flying car transports his family and lovely lady friend, Truly Scrumptious (Sally Ann Howes), to Vulgaria, a kingdom strangely devoid of children, ruled by the evil Baron Bomburst. There, they must solve the mystery of the missing tots and save Chitty from the nefarious Vulgarians. This musical classic also features Robert Helpmann as the oily, deeply unnerving Child Catcher.
