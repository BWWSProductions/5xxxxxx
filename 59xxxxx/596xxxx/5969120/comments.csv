,coolvicks,2010-11-24T11:31Z,"Can someone who has downloaded this, please comment on the Audio/Video quality of this release?"
,Aquaxi,2010-11-28T04:27Z,"Great movie! A/V 10/10 
Though, I had trouble while burning it do a DVD, my computer nor my DVD player would read it D:"
[T],HD-R-US,2010-11-28T05:51Z,"@Aquaxi

As stated in the release notes, non-AVCHD/Blu-ray drives will write the movie image to a DVD disc, but they will not autorun it - only a compatible player will, although of course, you can play the .m2ts video file from the BDMV/STREAM folder, as long as you have the correct codecs installed.

Glad you enjoyed it - it's a crackin' movie. =)"
[T],HD-R-US,2010-11-28T05:54Z,"@ moreplease1

Cheers - glad to have a little more time to get some uploading done."
,moreplease1,2010-11-30T19:14Z,No kidding your torrents are the best quality on DVD 5 mate - I am following you across different torrents as you do not up everything here on tpb shame that 
,coolvicks,2010-12-02T06:53Z,"At just 4.35 GB, this is the best 1080p release of this movie so far. Thanks HD-R-US!"
,osriccc,2010-12-08T17:41Z,"WHY, WHY? This is the best rip but the hardcoded subs... WHY?????"
,xkshitizx,2010-12-10T02:38Z,"hi HD-R_US 

you i have very slow internet connection , by reading all those comments im sure this has great video and audio quality but coukld you please post some screens so that i get to know abt the picture and one more question if you dont mind.. i dont have bluray player i tend to play it in my laptop my laptop plays 1080p great so is it just enough for me to extract those iso files and play via VLC or any other media player ??"
,xkshitizx,2010-12-10T02:39Z,"sorry i mean i have very slow internet connection.. 

i said you .. sorry abt that"
,xkshitizx,2010-12-10T02:53Z,"please HD-R-US could you please upload that bluray version of Twilight saga Eclipse Also 
Thankyou :)
"
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-10T03:47Z,"Hi xkshitizx. You shouldn't need to extract the iso to play the movie on VLC Media Player. If it won't open directly, mount it on a virtual drive and then open it... or extract it with PowerISO v4.5+ - the choice is yours.

As a number of my regular downloaders have requested it, The Twilight Saga - Eclipse will be available in a few days."
,xkshitizx,2010-12-10T14:27Z,"Thankyou very much for your help

hmm. i have another question for you to ask .. please if you dont mind

i have mac desktop in my home and i want to watch it on it so is there power iso available for mac too??

again thankyou very much :)"
,Farren246,2010-12-14T17:31Z,"With CCCP installed I was able to mount and play the movie file in Windows Media Player, but not VLC (wierd)!  Burning worked great!

Actually you don't necessarily need a bluray or HDDVD writer to burn this.  On a whim I used my laptop's standard DVD writer to put it on a Memorex DVD-R.  Burning with, of all things, the Windows 7 ISO burner (minimalist ftw).

Of course the burnt disc doesn't play in my computer (impossible to read the format with my DVD writer) but it works fine in my TV's bluray player."
,k13ss,2010-12-17T18:38Z,tell me how to seed and i will do that
,JUSTlN182,2010-12-21T08:37Z,"I burned this to a memorex DVD+R with imgburn and it said no errors or anything, but my blu ray player doesnt recognize the content. i have a magnavox blu ray player so did i do something wrong or is it my player??"
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-22T16:24Z,"Him JUSTlN182. Is your blu-ray player AVCHD compatible? Most are, but not all. You'd need to check your user manual or look for the spec's online for that information. "
,JUSTlN182,2010-12-22T20:24Z,"@ HD-R-US thats probably it but thanks anyways, i can still watch them through my pc and the quality is great"
,adityajuneja7,2011-01-05T16:02Z,CAN YOU PLEASE SEEEEEE... 2 YEARS LATER...EEEEED!
,Failz0r,2011-01-06T11:06Z,"Hi HD-R-US and thanks for your Movie upload. As you suggested , I downloaded PowerISO v4.7 -  extracted both BDMV and Certificate files. Opened BDMV>Stream and there found AVCHD Video 00000.m2ts file.
Started it with my Windows Media Player. Video is great and more than I expected but I'm having problems with the Audio. I can only hear the environment and nothing else. Can't hear the actors voice at all. The Audio quality is also PERFECT, well at least the environment's  :) Could you please help me, would really appreciate it.

Happy New Year and keep up the good work.
Cheers!"
,Failz0r,2011-01-06T21:23Z,"I just want to add.
Downloaded your Twillight Saga movie.
Having same problems Audio/Video Q 10 !
But I can only hear the environment sounds."
[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-11T05:44Z,"Hi Failz0r - I'm not sure which audio codec pack/filters you are using, or what your setup is, so it's a little hard for me to offer help, but the audio track is 6 channel and you are only hearing the lower frequency channels, so the chances are, you're either using a 5.1 speaker system, but your computer is setup for 2/2.1 channel/s, or more likely, your computer's speaker system is only 2 channel, but your audio codecs/sound card are set up for 5.1 surround sound.

I hope this helps - all the best."
,kenney303,2011-01-19T05:26Z,Just wondering if this has the actual 5.1 channel DTS soundtrack converted to ac3 or is it Just 2.1 expanded to 5.1. This Is very important for me so if someone could confirm one or the other. keep up the good work HD R US
[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-20T19:35Z,"kenney303 - We'd never consider up-converting from 2.1 channels to 5.1 channels. All of our releases are either left in original DTS format, or converted from 6 channel DTS to 6 channel ac3. I hope this helps."
,Levaimate,2011-01-21T22:23Z,"The movie and the quality is great, but I have some problems with the subs. I've downloaded your subs from the website, put them into the stream folder next to the video, renamed it to 00000.srt, turned the subtitles on, but nothing happened. What else should I do? (I use Windows Media Player)"
,247torrent,2011-02-20T20:09Z,Any way to add dutch subtitles to this?
,ShaunJ4Y1873,2011-04-30T21:26Z,"hey, i downloaded this and used power iso to extract the file so i can watch on my pc and the picture and sound are all working fine but the aspect ratio is not 16:9. When i watch the film on full screen i get black bits on the top/bottom. Please could someone help me with this as i do plan on downloading more from HD-R-US xD"
,pbxpb,2011-05-22T19:05Z,hi HD-R-US i have been following ur torrents i have a 11 gb copy of inception from another torrent which says 1920x1080 but when i play the video it isnt full screen the top and bottom are black meaning its not fullscreen and aspect ratio is probably not 16:9 so my question is that is this copy of inception full screen with 16:9 aspect ratio ? will this cover myy screen completely ??????
