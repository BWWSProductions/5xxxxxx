,havoc307,2010-12-25T14:01Z,Another great one. i have to say i'm becoming a fan. but i have to know.. what software are you using. I'm been tryiing to get multipal vids on one disk but i can't break 6 vids a disk. please let me know how i can contact you for this. no joke.
[T],spotswood,2010-12-25T15:40Z,Make up an email and I'll give you the info.  If people start putting custom dvd torrents out there that suck it just hurts the people that put good one's out there.  Get my drift....

,MoviesR101,2011-03-23T12:31Z,"@ Erx31 - Listen up Idiot! Don't be mad at the uploader, it is your responsibility to read all the information before downloading! Either you burn them to Dvd or you move on to another torrent! Obviously you won't be able to watch these on VLC!"
,Sick3r,2011-04-07T18:57Z,"MoviesR101. Upening ISO with VLC works just fine........

And there's something called daemon tools also."
,rsqbrimstone,2011-05-11T18:32Z,"hey guys, because I want to do the right thing in return for downloading and having others doing the right thing, how can I make sure I seed for others. Im a 20th century man in this. also what is a good program to burn to a DVD. I have nero.
Thanks to the seeders! PEACE"
,blusniffer,2011-05-17T05:59Z,"Thanx alot m8 but you are missing episode 7 GILEAD. both nti discs have 6 on each but according to imdb it has 13.

,M0SHP1T,2011-07-22T01:00Z,how does this iso fit onto a dvd a try with convert x and it says bad quailty if I burn it ...
,cyberzed,2011-08-23T13:12Z,Excellent quality. Thanks very much.
,Stonecon,2011-08-26T01:05Z,"I downloaded this and opened with vlc or youi can burn straight to dvd.  All the menus are built for you so it saved me a bunch of time.  I had this in the past but lost it so i had to download again.  This isn't the same as the first download I had and the episode ""GILEAD"" is missing.  This is episode 7 in season 2.  Each season always has 13 episodes.  Other than that great job and much thanks to the uploader!!!!"
