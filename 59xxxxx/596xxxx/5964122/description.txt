    Wallace and Gromit look at ingenious inventions for the    
    home. From 1940s household robots and strange humanoid    
    butlers to cutting-edge labour-saving devices, the pair  
    explore the social history of domestic life through       
    inventions.                                                
                                                              
    There is a visit to the home of iconic inventor Trevor   
    Baylis - the man who revolutionised the radio - and       
    meet George, one of the first walking humanoid robots      
    ever built, as he is brought to life for the first time   
    in 60 years by his creator, Tony Sale.                   
                                                              
    We visit the world's largest collection of the             
    peculiarly English invention, the teasmade, and delve     
    into the mind of a young Malawian inventor who designed  
    windmills to power his family's home.                     
                                                               
    Finally, Jem Stansfield visits some budding young         
    inventors in Oxford who are recreating a fridge first    
    devised by Einstein which never got off the drawing       
    board.
