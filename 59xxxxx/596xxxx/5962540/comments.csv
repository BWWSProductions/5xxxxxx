,jersson,2010-11-19T21:18Z,Can I install on top of Acrobat 9 or have I to remove my old vers ?
[V],Cyberpiraten,2010-11-20T17:56Z,"You could install on top but i recommend to uninstall first :)  

Ty BTW :) "
,aucado54,2010-11-24T22:50Z,thanks for the up. I have tried another and it failed miserably
,jersson,2010-12-01T21:11Z,"Couldn't get tha scanning from scanner to PDF work. It says scannings cancelled, Any Idea ?"
,consptheory77,2010-12-10T00:48Z,I have been beset by Trojans ever since installing this. I wonder if this is coincidence. 
,consptheory77,2010-12-12T03:29Z,"Yep, rootkits and trojans are abounding on this one, including TDSS and a browser redirect.  It took four different malware removers to deal with this, and by that time, already scarred my OS so bad I had to reinstall last night. AVOID. "
[V],Cyberpiraten,2010-12-12T19:53Z,"Get tha fuck out of here! this is the Scenereleases release! Scanned by Trend Micro OfficeScan, THIS is NO virus you fuckface! 

Scanned by TrendMicro Officescan = No Virus detected. 
Scanned bt Avast Pro = No Virus Detected. 
Scanned by AVG = No Virus Deteced.
Scanned by Norton Antivirus = No Virus detected.

GTFO kiddo!"

,jaymsd,2011-01-02T18:18Z,"thanks for the torrent Cyberpiraten, but am having problems with the serials/crack. installs fine but then a couple of days afterwards it flashes up saying serial incorrect and i have to enter a new one, with this flashing up as invalid in another day.
have tried reinstalling etc but keeps happening.
some guys noted the same thing on your adobe x suite torrent too, i was just wondering if it was anything simple that could be fixed?
thanks anyway though, besides the serial its a great seed, quick download and well packed etc."
,deridder23,2011-02-06T09:43Z,"Having the same prob as jaymsd, started noticing the invalid keys after a few days."
,qinyanshanren,2011-02-08T00:45Z,"Thank you CyberPiraten.

I have installed it on my Win-7 64 PC for 2 months. No error so far.

Did use Norton to block internet access. "
,Buster_Tintin,2011-02-09T10:39Z,"Any1 have Acrobat X Pro, Swedish?

TIA :-)"
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-02-17T00:54Z,"Updates ask before it updates but i have the same problem (how to remove updates) .... 

Other languages can be downloaded from adobe.com 
"
,qinyanshanren,2011-02-25T23:53Z,"Remove update, you may try  this:

1. Launch Acrobat x.
2. Go to Edit / Preferences../ Updater...
3. Select ""Do not download or install updates automatically""

Hope this would help. "
,martinette,2011-03-08T11:14Z,"I did what you said, but the software won't install because ""it is impossible on my system""
I am running XP pro SP2, checked diskspace (10 Gb), speed (1.6 Ghtz), RAM (2Gb) and retried with no success (starting installation then giving an error message after the choice of the language). I was replacing my acrobat 8 version which unfortunately had been updated online and thereafter blocked, but which had been uninstalled. Any clue for this ? Thank you for your help"
,iisthphir,2011-03-14T04:56Z,"Thanks lotss..

,Snoddas10,2011-03-29T23:57Z,"Anyone know where to find other languages for this one at adobe.com?I´ve been searching but cant find it.I´m looking for swedish language.

,Snoddas10,2011-03-30T00:00Z,"Where at adobe.com can u find the language packs for this one?I´m looking for swedish language.
Thx"

,abaka,2011-04-04T22:32Z,It has trojan .. after 4 days its works and redirect your bowser and try to install windows 7 virus software.....
,abaka,2011-04-04T22:37Z,Trojan carefull
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-04-10T05:32Z,"There's no trojan you prick! I hate wheen noobs like you comming here claiming my torrents got trojan's and shit!  The Activation Blocker is a batch file, sometimes it will come  up like a ""virus"" cause it gives commands to the computer. 

And if it's not that, then you kids should stop downloading so mutch porn! 

Language pack's. 
I'm sry, i could not find a language pack eighter.... 
Look's like it's no language pack for this edition for some reason. 

With regards, CyberP"

,1ackass,2012-01-29T17:42Z,The hosts patch doesnt seem to work anymore for me :P. Just one day i needed to use it and it said i have trial. Then i wrote the serial and it told me that the serial was wrong. Any help?
,1ackass,2012-01-29T18:07Z,lulz. I just installed F-secure and discovered that it resetted the hosts file(It thought it was a virus wtf).now im ok. btw very good job.
,razi-shoaib,2012-03-24T19:41Z,"I have tried all serial keys given in this page but none of them working well, every time it says that trial is over put the serial number, any one can help to solve this issue . i will really appreciate.

Thnx"
,bichi_don,2012-04-16T05:33Z,"Respected CyberPiraten,
Adobe Patch v1.0 does not works for me,so could you tell me how to enter the entries in hosts file manually."
,OnePiecePirate,2012-05-11T10:54Z,"I've been using this for a year already without any hiccups at all. Recently installed the program on another PC without the crack (using AcroPro installer and the first serial alone -- the installer was originally from an installation after patching the crack i.e. a complete copy from C:Program FilesAdobe Acrobat 10.0 of the former PC). And the newly installed program worked well. Sorry for the late comment, and thanks for the great share, CyberP."
,OnePiecePirate,2012-05-11T20:56Z,"I forgot one thing: DON'T EVER let the application install any update (this applies to every cracked software), for otherwise the crack will be destroyed and whatever serials you got will not work anymore. 

There might be a solution to this: Deleting EVERY registry keys associated with Acrobat...and that would prove to be an ordeal task to accomplish, even with the help of a process-monitoring software. Although, if installed on a ""fresh"" PC, it would surely work.

In the end, those who did install the update might as well look for another software (or just buy it). For those who are downloading this, make sure you (after finishing the setup installation) go to Edit>Preferences, and under ""Category"", click ""Updater"" and check ""Don't check for update...""."
