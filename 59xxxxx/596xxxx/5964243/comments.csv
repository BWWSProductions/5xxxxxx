However, I am perplexed by the software because though it installed fine and worked fine at first it then would not let me modify my user acct. by improving speech comprehension.
Then, I tried reinstalling but it freezes (Program does not respond) when I try to setup my user acct. initially. So now I can't even use the software at all.
Anybody had that problem?
Im running W7, x64"

,knotoftoads,2011-02-13T18:55Z,"I'm writing this right now by way of the program  from this torrent.I will not make any corrections so you can see for yourself the accuracy if you are not familiar with this product.

It is working so far on my Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit. I would classify myself as a medium level user. What I did was copy and paste all of the comments and all of the instructions in all of the files into a document, and read through them several times while the torrent was downloading. I then took it slow step-by-step and double checked what I was doing at each step. My Windows security essential antivirus did pick up the infected file, and although I elected to not take any action while the RAR file was extracting, that file apparently was removed at some point because when I went back to remove it, it was gone.

I will run another VirusScan just to make sure. I think if one has patients(ha ha that was the only mistake it made so far) you will be able to get this to work. I have used Dragon NaturallySpeaking for many many years, and I could, but, would not do without it.

Thanks to the uploader, and all others who had any hand in this project."

so all was good with unwrap.exe until the end where it kept telling me i had a bunch of jpg files missing, which i assume were for the UI by what they were named (-_-)
well i extracted the .rar file twice to see if it had extracted inconsistantly and both times told me  i had a ton of missing files so i dunno what happened to the torrent lol"

,MaddamVP,2011-11-04T01:01Z,I know what keygen Trojans look like and i know what backdoor nasty trojans look like and this torrent is filled with the NASTY trojans that are sniffing for info all over my PC. Good thing I stopped it from executing into the root.
