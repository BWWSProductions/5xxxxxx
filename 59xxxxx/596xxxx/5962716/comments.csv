,pafc,2010-11-17T19:35Z,thanks a million
,crobby88,2010-11-19T03:37Z,Is this a rip of a proper retail CD or is it a compilation of 320kbps songs from multiple sources?
,crobby88,2010-11-19T03:48Z,"ID3 tags are not correct - the titles are fine but the artist tag is the same on every track. Also the track numbers are not correct. Don't bother with this torrent, wait 3 days until a proper rip comes out."
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-11-19T10:06Z,"Its a rip from multiple sources, and all songs are at a rate of 320kbps. The tags will be different because of that. The track order is taken from the tracklisting on the HMV website. The tracks are all in the order listed above. Take it or leave it. I thought it would be nice to make one up before the official release, and, in my opinion, (and hopefully other people's too) it's spot on! but hey, everyone has their own opinion - so take it or leave it i guess!"
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-11-19T10:10Z,"If anyone else could comment if they have any issues with this (or praises of course) that would be great :) I did up a version with multiple bitrate, but i was first to admit that some of the songs weren't top notch. That's why i started afresh and did each song individually."
,theoriginalphantom,2010-11-19T14:54Z,"First off I want to thank you for the time and trouble of doing this for others. Am downloading it now, and as far as I am concerned if it fits on discs then all is good. Those that want to find fault then look in a damn mirror.
Much appreciated Horrorspoke."
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-11-19T20:05Z,Thanks for the heads up mate!
,gregsir,2010-11-22T18:00Z,Thanks so much for this :)

,nathan1996,2010-11-23T15:22Z,the second cd number 1 has a bit of static in it
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-11-23T17:00Z,"^^ Must be the CD you used, as all songs are taken from different sources, and not the same CD, so each song is different, although all are 320kbps."
,illmatic-a,2010-11-25T14:35Z,"First off thank you Horrorspoke ;-) Second I cant believe these people have the neck to complain about the tags and order. This guy went and got all the track's at 320kbs made the torrent and uploaded, all you have to do if you would take the time and stop whining and goto hmv or another tag them in itunes yourself. But no you wont. Stop bitching about the guys torrents and say thank you dum ass mutherfuckers. This is why AXXO stopped because of fuckers like crobby88. Retrack your comment and kill yourself. Thank You Horrorspoke just to let you know 2330 people like this torrent but only a few have put a comment. I own you one. Peace out dude keep up the good work as worldwide we love it..."
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-11-25T15:20Z,"^^ Thanks for taking the time to comment mate, appreciated. Feel a bit better now!"
,marcoleetan1980,2010-11-25T22:44Z,"thank for this, its my first time to download this album. you caught my attention by that 320kbps.
its the quality that counts, not the error of the tracks' tag."
,dontlikeitbuyit,2010-11-26T18:53Z,WHY DO PEOPLE MOAN ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS FREE ( IF YOU DONT LIKE IT GO BUY IT ) THANKS HORRORSPOKE KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK !!!!
,dontlikeitbuyit,2010-11-26T19:17Z,"thanks good download, for those who moan if you dont like it go buy it "

[V],Horrorspoke,2010-12-02T15:39Z,"Haha! Trojan - Well i'm fucked then, as its been on my PC for ages!"
,GlennJohnson,2010-12-04T00:22Z,"Sorry but I don't really see the point of compiling these from different sources. A few of the tracks especially on disc 2 are in mono!! WTF?

Yeah I know it's free but so is a proper torrent of the retail CD's"
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-12-04T13:35Z,"^^^ Understand what you're saying mate, but at the end of the day, this was out before the retail CD rip? so.... there you go :P"
,Zalamero,2010-12-08T11:17Z,"Thanks !   Horrorspoke

Trash"
,crobby88,2011-03-05T19:27Z,"I just read my comment back that I wrote a while ago, and I really sounded like an ungrateful douchebag... which is not how I wanted to come across!

My comments weren't an insult to you at all, Horrorspoke, they were more a guide for others downloading the torrent so that they knew what they were getting, since there were a couple of bits of information missing from the description. I'm quite fussy when it comes to my downloads, i.e. I like them to be from a retail CD and all be tagged properly (not that I have a problem with doing it myself), but for the majority of people this rip is great.

So, in short, thanks for the effort and the upload, even if it's not one that I would personally pick :)"
,thefinest,2011-03-10T13:53Z,"awesome, lots of music that i would have had to download individually all in one torrent, also good to see you included the album cover, hate it when people dont. AAAA"
