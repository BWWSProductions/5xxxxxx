,escos,2010-11-25T14:08Z,"tip top,thanks for this,100% this is Ministry Of Sound Anthems Electronic 80s 2,saltire???what you on about. "
,rostbif,2010-11-28T15:55Z,Great post thanks. @Saltire this _is_ named correctly; you're mistaken about this being the original from last year.
,rapterman,2010-12-05T15:22Z,is this the 2010 ?????????????????????????????????
,GrimmReaperDude,2010-12-05T17:47Z,Great download but Saltire is right this is the 2009 version.  Do some research and you'll see this to be true. Front covers are very similar that's what caught me out at first but tracklistings are very different.
,toffeeapple2010,2010-12-14T22:03Z,"The track listing is different to Ministry Of Sound Anthems Electronic 80s 1, this torrent seems fine to me."
,desotodeson,2010-12-30T16:02Z,This is 2010. many thanks
,paulderby,2011-01-15T14:20Z,this is the 2009 version NOT 2010
