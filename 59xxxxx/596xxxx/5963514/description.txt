Scala & Kolacny Brothers is a Belgian girls' choir, conducted by Stijn Kolacny and arranged and accompanied by Steven Kolacny on the piano. Formed in 1996 and winning the Belgian 'Choir of the Year'-contest in 2000, they have made five studio albums, starting with On The Rocks in 2002.
Most songs are specially made arrangements of well-known musicians and bands such as Bjork, Radiohead, U2, Nirvana, Depeche Mode, Muse, Rammstein, etc. although they have also been very successful with their own compositions.
In 2006, Rammstein released their live album Volkerball which features Scala's "Engel".
In 2008 Scala was asked to do a project in remembrance of the legendary Belgian singer Pierre Rapsat, who died in 2002. The sold out Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dans les Yeux dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢AuroreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ tour strengthened ScalaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationship with BelgiumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s French-speaking audience. The number of concerts in Germany also increased steadily and Scala performed more and more songs in German, including its version of MIAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hit, Ã¢â‚¬ËœHungriges HerzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which was used in a top national German television commercial.
In July 2010, a trailer for the film The Social Network was released in around the world, featuring an edited version Scala's cover of Radiohead's "Creep".This trailer was seen over 250 million times in cinemas and on TV, as well as over 1 million times on YouTube.
Scala's album CIRCLE was released in Belgium in June 2010 and will be released worldwide throughout the Fall. A special German edition of 'Circle', will be released as a double CD November 26, 2010
