IDIOT spammer from antipirates PIZZZZOFF!

gorang ....excellent torrents..... find it here: http://thepiratebay.org/user/goran

OOOPPPPSSS nothing there ....that is real quality--------haha 

So stay away from things you don't understand IDIOT!"
,Exerz,2010-12-20T19:51Z,"Looking at your screens, you can see that gorang is right. The image IS blurry. Insulting people who comment on your torrent is not a great way to get people to dl it.

And for the record, I think you are the one who do not understand. Just because something is 720px wide, does not mean it's actually 720p. If anything, this looks like an upscaled dvd rip.

Also, looking through the rest of your torrents. this doesn't seem to be the only one that's blurry."
[V],Zen_Bud,2010-12-21T14:21Z,"@Exerz  Shut the fuck up IDIOT!

I know that you are one off the antipirate spammer !

Here is the prove: https://thepiratebay.org/user/Exerz/...nada ...empty....that is blurry
