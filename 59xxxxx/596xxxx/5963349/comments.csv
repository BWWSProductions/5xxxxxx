,balljoint,2011-09-04T01:01Z,"use hj-split to unpack, mount with daemon tools and copy and paste crack into the vitality folder."
,AARRGG,2011-10-21T01:14Z,"i used hj-pack to unpack the files and it created anew file with no file extention that was not recognised by daemon tools. uploader please find a better way to make torrents that is more commonly used or atleast leave precise instructions on how it is used. would have been a good pload if it had some more ""how to"" with it."
,CapnRis,2011-12-26T10:50Z,"It's not hard to figure out, but here's the extended run-down:

1. Download the torrent (dur)
2. Open one of the files with the number extension (.001, .002, etc.) with a compression program such as WinRar
3. Extract the .iso image file to somewhere on your computer.
4. Use a virtual CD-ROM program such as Daemon Tools to mount the .iso file on your virtual rom.
5. Run the CD to begin installation.
6. Open the CD file as you would a CD on your computer, and look in the ""Vitality"" folder for the patch and crack; run the patch, and copy the crack file into the installation folder, overwriting anything there."
