BUT

Could you please increase the quality of each episode maybe double or even quadruple it to hd

Even a doubling of size and quality would be good enough

And about your name

It can be confusing because people who deliberately upload bad things and viruses and all that also choose names with a negative sound to them because that is how people like that function, they are evil and know it. They pick a bad name so that everyone can see how bad they are and then laugh in their face when people say why did you do this bad thing, so they can reply: what did you think.

So next time you create a name select a more neutral name

But then again this might all be your masterplan to get a thepiratebay logo next to your name so that you can indeed start uploading viruses and all that and then laugh in peoples face and say: what did you think."
