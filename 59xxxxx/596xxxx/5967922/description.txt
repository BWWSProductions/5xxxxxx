At last, here's what you should've learned in high school biology! 
This paperback edition is an Everyman's humorous look at the real differences -biological, 
historical, psychological- between men and women with fun and provocative insight into what really drives behavior and interactions between men and women.

Men talk about women to men. Women talk about men to women. 
Men and women talk to each other (or try to) about relationships. 

It's Not You, It's Biology provides insight, ammunition, snappy comebacks, and interesting cocktail party banter for everyone who ever wondered why we do what we do vis-a-vis the opposite sex.

It's Freakonomics for the Relationship-Challenged.
