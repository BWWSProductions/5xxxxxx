,humanoid999,2011-07-12T03:28Z,"Thank you for this great torrent! I will keep seeding for a while.  

I had to explain to a friend what seeding meant, so for all the people who don't know how this works, more people seeding means its easier/faster to get stuff you like.  If you download something and like it, just keep it in your queue for a while so that way other people can get it too.
Sharing = Caring"
