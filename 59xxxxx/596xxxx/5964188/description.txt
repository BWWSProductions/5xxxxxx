Synopis: Lol (Lola,15) can't wait to see all her friends on the first day back at middle school. But when she splits up with her boyfriend Arthur, she is heartbroken and only MaÃ«l seems to understand her. The only problem is MaÃ«l is Arthur's best friend. In a world of IPods and MSN, Lol and her friends are feeling their way through tenth grade, speaking a language peppered with text message shortcuts and dodging their often divorced and largely overwhelmed parents. After an affair with her ex-husband, Lolâ€™s mum Anne, is being courted by a police detective. When she "accidentally" reads her teenage daughter's journal, she realises just how wide the communication gap has become. But Lol and Anneâ€™s differences are resolved as they join forces to save MaÃ«l's musical dream.
