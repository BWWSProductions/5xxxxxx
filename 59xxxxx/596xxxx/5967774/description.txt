Continuing its reputation for releasing excellent jazz and world music, the Blue Note label has issued the third volume of Blue Brazil. Although many of the traditional Brazilian artists on this compilation might be unknown to North American audiences, the bossa nova sound will always be familiar. For Blue Brazil, Vol. 3, Mark Taylor dove deep into the archives to pull together a unique collection of rare and obscure music in the bossa nova tradition. None of the tracks have been previously released on compilations or LP reissues in Japan or Europe, making this album even more of a gem. The Brazilian sound is made complete with a touch of samba, compliments of a Monsueto track from the early '60s. For fans of Brazilian music or just beginners looking to learn, Blue Brazil, Vol. 3 comes highly recommended. ~ Diana Potts

The album is good! If you enjoy Blue Note or Brazilian music then its more than worth the small price. Blue Note fans will particularly enjoy this album as the fusion of styles is well suited and executed.
The album starts off in high spirits of the Samba then meanders through the Blue notes of Brazil, excellent for dinner parties or nights in.

However the only point of caution would be to those of you who would be into hard core Brazilian Music, then this might not be your favorite cup of tea, all be it one to which you may wish to experience. ~ John Duff
