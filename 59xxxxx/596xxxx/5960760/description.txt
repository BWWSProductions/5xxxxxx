The THIS AIN`T TWO AND A HALF MEN XXX spoof involves everyone`s favorite TV bachelors, Charlie (Evan Stone) and Alan (James Deen). In the beginning of the film we find Alan trying to hang himself out of desperation for his love life. It turns out that Alan`s ex-girlfriend (Jenna Presley) is now living with Alan`s ex-wife (Dylan Ryder). Not only that, but Charlie is having an intimate relationship with Alan`s ex-girlfriend`s mother (Madison Ivy), and Alan`s ex-girlfriend`s father (Eric John) is having an affair with Alan`s ex-wife. Poor Alan! And things get even crazier when Charlie`s ex-girlfriend (Brooke Lee Adams) shows up with her new girlfriend (Jamey Janes) and they both take advantage of and dominate Charlie. But in the end, all wrongs are righted when Alan and his ex girlfriend get back together and everyone seems to be appropriately coupled up.
