,Ps3shaman,2011-01-31T04:27Z,"Does anyone got this work with FW 3.55, and if so which file manager you used?"
,broken_bazooka,2011-02-01T21:18Z,"1. Data needs to be installed while run from internal hdd first.
2. Then it can be run from external (usb)

BTW, this game is not much better than the original. Don't expect Oblivion quality.

Personally, I feel like a part of my life was wasted on a subpar game. 
Thank god for warez that enables us to test before buying. 
If I would've bought this game, with the high pricetag it has, I would've felt ripped off."
