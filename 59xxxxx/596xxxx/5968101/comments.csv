I was wondering if you were considering a 720p encode by any chance ?"

Thanks to both Bob and Jeff!

Sharing is caring."

,Ratmanslim,2011-01-12T17:16Z,"Wow... 8GB for a movie from the 50s? Not to be rude but no HD camera = no HD picture. Sure it's uppscaled, but not exactly HD quality"
,pilot12,2011-02-07T10:56Z,"Ratmanslim: this is completely false statement. You don't need a HD camera to get HD content. Think about it: how were the movies shot in the past? With a roll film. You put that roll film inside a special machine that scan the whole in HD, you get your movie in HD.

How DVD are created? Same way but now instead of getting 720x576 we get 1920x1080. 

And when a new Super HD size will be out in some year, they will take the roll film from the shelves and scan it in 4000x4000.

Of course there must be a limit of the roll film itself. I read it somewhere on wikipedia but we didn't reach that scan limit yet.

Maybe ""scan"" is not the correct word, i'm not specialist but it is just to get the idea.

And thanks for this great movie. "
