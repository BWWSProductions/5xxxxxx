,zalias,2010-11-18T21:23Z,"false, and don't working"
,puppeteer666,2010-11-18T21:46Z,"It is working okay on my box Win7x64.
Works on Career mode just fine do not activate and do no not create a EA account."
,puppeteer666,2010-11-18T21:50Z,"Works fine on my PC Windows 7 x64
Make sure to skip activation on install & DO NOT create a EA account when starting a new game.
Only works on Career mode and not multiplayer.
If you want to play multiplayer & like the single player support the developers and buy.

Also be sure to launch from the NFS11.exe not the launcher.exe."
,zalias,2010-11-19T09:38Z,I get dont send't eror with this crack :/
,asusVENTO,2010-11-26T01:33Z,"My PC Core i7,  9GB, 260 GTX running legal VISTA x64.

For me this is like downloading the demo, if it runs on my PC, after it runs good i need to buy it for online races ;)

The NFS11.EXE works, skip the online activation is a bit weird, but after skipping the instalation in the ad key screen, the install compleet anyway....
After install Replace the NFS11.EXE, and run this, and you have the game ;)

Dont use other stuff!!!, the other stuff like the online tool is fake and give you a virus only."

,dhruv990s,2010-12-06T09:43Z,"@oops20001
My friend tried this crack after using the 1.1 patch and he says it worked perfectly. Try it out, I personally haven't tested this as my DVD drive is fucked, (wont read anything i guess the lens is broken) so haven't been able to install the game as yet."
