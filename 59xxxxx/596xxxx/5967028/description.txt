Mystical Monuments of Ancient Greece.

A look at the Parthenon, Acropolis, and the Agora. Pericles, herald of the Golden Age, commissioned tremendous monuments dedicated to Athena, protectress of the city. Was their real purpose to promote a new brand of politics called democracy, or to serve as a platform for a brutally intense cult? We also visit the city's marketplace.
