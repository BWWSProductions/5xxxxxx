I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.
I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. 
Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. 
Surely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.

A torrent I found on Demonoid and I hardly made it to complete:
A tribute to Jethro Tull by an unknown captive fan who made an excellent bootleg from footage material.
Mind - You have a double DVD... but don't expect a DVD quality (even if the result is at 90% highly satisfying...)
To those who want HD... forget it... this is 70s music... when video clips culture does not exist... take this as a fair example of progressive music...

3 - The Minstrel Years 1971-1975 aka The Jeffrey Hammond - Hammond Era

Would you believe Jethro Tull NEVER professionally recorded a show from this period? This is their prime! This is the era of Aqualung, Thick As A Brick, A Passion Play, Warchild and NO professional video OR EVEN soundboard audio of these tours exists to this day

They did film about an hour's worth of footage in Paris in July of 1975 but except for the clip of Minstrel in the Gallery you'll see on this DVD, the rest of this footage has yet to surface.

This portion of the DVD set does include more 8mm footage (of the Brick and Passion Play tours) than I would've liked to have included but I felt  I HAD to address this time in the band's history one way or another. I'm hoping that Tull fans will view those performances for what they are, as historical documents of a time of the band's history that otherwise would've been visually lost forever and only remembered by the souls who were there.  We are very fortunate that some fans snuck in their 8mm home cameras. 

	- Life's A Long Song, promotional video from 1971
	- Thick As A Brick 8mm highlights, 1972-  from Rochester, New York USA.  Only about 4 minutes worth but very intereting to 	   see the band enter the stage in rabbitt costumes and Ian answering the phone in the middle of a performance.  Is there a 		   Mike Nelson in the audience? There seems to be a fish on the line.
	- A Passion Play 8mm highlights, 1973 - About 7 minutes of footage here.  The original live audio was so bad for this that 		   the audio from the remastered CD was edited i and synced up to the footage.  Much better viewing.
	- The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles, 1973 - the original film that was shown at the concerts the Passion Play tour.  			   Excellent quality!
	- The Minstrel in the Gallery, Paris 1975 - about an hour and 10 minutes of footage was shot during November 1975.  This 		   is all that has surfaced.
