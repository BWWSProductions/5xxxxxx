,clever101,2010-11-21T23:24Z,Why am i getting the black screen?
,animangavideo,2010-11-22T04:51Z,"I just started downloading this so I can't truly confirm my next statement, but I have read it several places. Apparently this game is in the same boat as COD: MW2. It can't boot from the hard drive. Apparently it has some different syscalls that are not easily patched with the current payloads. This fix would need to come from a custom firmware or a really patched boot manager. Check this link   http://psx-scene.com/forums/f177/prince-persia-trilogy-3d-3-50-too-70805/"
,animangavideo,2010-11-28T05:52Z,My previous comment is correct. This game will need a modified param.sfo AND a modified eboot.bin to work. We are probably going to have to wait for custom firmware or something. Just keep seeding and maybe a really good coder will help us out. Follow the link I posted above to see updates.
,anilpiggy,2010-11-30T01:01Z,i tried patching param sfo but nothing happen i think might be problem with eboot.bin
,anilpiggy,2010-11-30T01:02Z,in this discription they said tested with 3.41 how they can do with that???

,Izzitup,2011-03-29T22:12Z,"I downloaded the torrent, and had quite a few errors when extracting things. I downloaded the file Rocklord_1 posted, but don't see any method of properly downloading the game. Is anyone able to help me out? I'll seed afterwords."
,psmaniac,2011-08-01T16:01Z,Can the Bink video files be separated from the ISO or are the games archived within it in some format?
