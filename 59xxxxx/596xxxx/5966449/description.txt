1. Unrar Manually Or Use Our Installer
2. Run ~unpack~ From the Extracted Folder To Rebuild (Our Installer Does This Auto)

Other Notes:

Install/Rebuild Is Time/Space Consuming.
If Install/Unpack Seem To Freeze Leave It Alone.
D3d/dx9 errors/missing dll? Update DirectX.
Windows/Error Report? Your Specs Are Maybe To Low.
Total Install Took Us about 1 Hour 10 Mins On A DualCore.
