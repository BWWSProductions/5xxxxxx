,Colink69,2010-11-20T01:39Z,"Getting an error: ""Couldn't load image '~-gblack_8x8'""
Any tip for this problem, aside from reinstalling the game?"
,Colink69,2010-11-20T02:49Z,"Well, reinstalling fixed this problem. Working 100%, but not sure about the version, I think it's 1.0"
,Colink69,2010-11-20T04:00Z,"Third comment in a row, but this might be useful: you can install te skidrow patch 1.1 on this release, the games works like a charm now, too bad it's that bad of a game :p"

,GreyHaven1,2010-11-24T23:36Z,"Unfortunately, 75% of the reason for me downloading this is for the zombie game mode and this torrent doesn't have it. I tried to use a crack to unlock Zombie Solo mode, but it didn't work because the files are missing all together. So, what I did was download Skidrow's release and applied the crack to that. It worked, but his copy was unreliable and limited in terms of changing graphics settings for better performance. Ultimately, I copied all the missing files from Skidrow's on to this torrent (moderately time consuming) to this one and now it works great. There are still little bugs and glitches here and there, but nothing that hinders game playability. I should probably compress it and upload it here for the rest of you that are having problems, but I've never uploaded anything before...  "

,Davidthepirate,2010-12-05T03:29Z,"Okay.. So I installed it alright, it took awhile, but there was no errors. When I tried to run the game, apparently I was missing a few .dlls, so I found them and threw em in the black ops folder. I started up the game, started campaign, and quickly figured out that dialog doesn't work. No voices. Whatsoever. Does this happen to anyone else? Should I re-install? 
There's nothing wrong with my computer, I'm running an M11x r3 alienware laptop. It runs all the graphics on full settings alright, but the dialog doesn't work at all. Any suggestions? "

No zombie maps and no multiplayer (even offline bots maps mode not included). 
It only gives u the files for single-player campaign (and thus why the small size)
I was expecting an ACTUAL RIP OF THE WHOLE GAME and NOT a 'rip' of just the SP aspect.
There are also memory leaks and crashes to desktop after extended sessions. And no, its not my PC, all other games run fine. 
Avoid this and wait for an actual rip!"
,FiletMiiiniooon,2011-01-24T04:59Z,"@scamInc Don't be annoying. 
And if you're serious, know what you're doing before you do it. Google bittorrent terms."
