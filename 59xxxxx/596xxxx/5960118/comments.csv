,toon1906,2010-11-19T11:15Z,"so if i download this and plug it into my 3dtv, it will play in 3d?"
,jayposer2000,2010-11-22T07:20Z,"This is an incredible movie on my new 3DTV. I just converted to dvd and played in my PS3. It plays in side by side format, so i had to switch the 3Dinput on my Samsung 7000TV.  When the IMAX intro played, i was blown away with the 3D. Same with the part with the underwater snakes. 

One tech question, if anyone can help me. If i were to buy some blank blu ray discs, (my comp has a bluRay burner) what program could i use to convert and burn this to blu ray? I usually use convertx to dvd for my movies now, and still worked with this movie, but i lost picture quality cramming more than 6g on to a dvd. Anyone out there help? Ill keep seeding this for you guys, if someone can help... :)"
,jayposer2000,2010-11-23T12:17Z,"I have solved my own problem, I just downloaded a copy of Nero 10 from the bay. Now that its burned to a blu ray disk, it looks just that much more spectacular on my 3DTV. Thanks so much for the UP webchella!"
,moozieg,2010-11-28T11:35Z,Tried this in WMP and Divx. The audio either plays and skips/stutters or I get just a bunch of whirring noises and the video lags.
,Spitvall,2010-11-28T20:15Z,"@ moozieg : that's because of your hardware.
Try to burn it on a Blu-ray, it will be different."
,moozieg,2010-11-29T03:45Z,@spitvall Will do! The video quality was pretty stunning from the bit I could see!
,ender43,2010-12-04T19:33Z,"great stuff,felt like i was there.   cheers"

,hopko682,2011-02-24T05:40Z,"Looks awesome on my Samsung!
Some slight ghosting issues in corners of the screen occasionally, but other than that it looks amazing :-D"
,ronmann,2011-03-02T08:07Z,I'm just using VLC and the HDMI output to my TV.  Looks good but defiantly some ghosting.  Is there better software for this than VLC?  I don't like burning discs...
,Snaxxet,2011-03-09T23:43Z,"Im running this through my Tvix media player and then to my samsung 3D tv. FANTASTIC!!! although some parts of the movie seem damaged, same places.
The picture gets messed up in a colored blurr...then if I let it go too far the media player restarts. Does anyone know why this is? has it anything to do with my NOT SO expensice HDMI cable not beeing able to transfer quick enough?
I cant see how though, as some parts of the movie always work fine and some dont!
anyone else getting this?? please"
,samcicj,2011-03-22T14:25Z,Some one knows if i burn it on a Dvd works fine?  or only works  on a Blu-ray?

,sk2011,2011-09-18T02:16Z,"Ok 3dtv noob here. I just bought a $2000 3d plasma with all the bells and whistles. 

I just downloaded this torrent and put it on my ext. hdd and plugged it straight into a usb port on the back of my tv. 

I can see the file, i can play the file, 3d works with my pana glasses....but i see two images (side-by-side) of the same thing. Both in 3d too which is weird. Is my tv supposed to magically just combine those two images to make it 3d? 

There is a 3D button my tv remote which basically converts anything into 3d (even if it is not 3d) so i just pressed that button but all it does is just gives me is a side-by-side image in 3d which is kinda pointless. 

Anyone know what im doing wrong? "

,bigdrago,2011-12-11T21:35Z,Didn't work with my Philips 55PFL7606... well.. 3d works but something ain't right with the 3d depth
,nossek-x,2012-01-01T19:28Z,"played seamlessly on Samsung 3DTV using the included set of active-3D glasses: copy to external USB disk and then plug in TV. If not auto-detected as 3D content, then click on remote's 3D button, select ""side-by-side""."
,bumba2,2012-01-04T13:15Z,"thanks,nice up!!!plz do more imax if possible."
,executive_realness,2012-01-07T16:52Z,"Hmmm not sure whats wrong with this, the two sides don't seem to correlate properly giving a slightly odd 3d effect and lots of ghosting. Can anybody out there who is more technically minded shed any light on this. Watched plenty of 3D content and this is the first time this has happened. Watching on a projector via vlc player on macbook pro. 

Also thanks for all the upload Webchella. Always appreciated. "
,alex9066,2012-01-11T21:58Z,Could do with some help regarding this one guys.....Struggling to find a player which will play these imax files on my pc.
,Gore_Juice,2012-02-13T18:18Z,"Is there any possibility to download and watch NOT in 3D? I mean, I'm not equipped with a 3DTV but i still wanna watch this movie so what's gonna happen?
Thx"
,bigdrago,2012-05-11T14:18Z,"Is it just me, or is the 3D looking strange?"
