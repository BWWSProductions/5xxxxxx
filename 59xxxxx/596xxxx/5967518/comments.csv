,muthineni,2010-11-19T12:41Z,"yeah ghost and the darkness..
thats n interesting movie.

why have stopped posting screenshots. a small sample is fine too."
,minus111,2010-11-19T13:18Z,"Hello YIFY,Thanks for your uploads and Please continue to upload good torrents in future.
My request is if you could upload Step up 3d,i tired to download many of it prints but all came out to be bad once,if possible please try.(DVD rip also works)
Thank you :)"
,chackochi,2010-11-19T13:19Z,yify thnx dude for tis movie :)
,tylr,2010-11-19T16:14Z,"@YIFY :
BIG thanks.. Luv the 'size'
nice movie.. gr8t rip.. thanks a lot!

@muthineni :
buddy.. it wouldnt make a difference, its like a statement.. if its YIFY copy- its a good one ;)
..BDRip 720p means we know ""how it looks"" 
..the same goes for DvdRip 720p too.. , we know the difference between 720p & 480p..
..so WHY do u want a sample or screenshots to eXplain ""how the movie would be??""

@minus111 :
i think ""pluto999"" would do stepUp 3D.. so let yify release his own style of different movies.. 
..on the whole ""we"" get good prints of mkv from tpB, so feel happy about it..

..thanKs again to u YIFY.. cheers!"
,tylr,2010-11-19T16:19Z,"^^^ @muthineni :
..im sorry, it would make NO difference.."
,DSIN,2010-11-19T16:22Z,"thanx dude..
list of upcoming uploads plz ? :D"
,DSIN,2010-11-19T16:28Z,"@tyler...nice one dude.. but screenshots do help if there's any pixelation...
but then again... yify is one of the best uploader here.. so ""if some1 can't trust him..he shld go somewhere else"" ;)
XD"
,muthineni,2010-11-19T17:22Z,"Its been a while since i got yify rips.
of course hes good.anyway i am downloading this. will comment later. 

@ all . i understand guys but how can u miss  the main point- some encodes turn out brilliant while some turn out good. that was the reason i asked for a sample .
no offence at all yify. thank you for stealth"
,tylr,2010-11-20T02:50Z,"^^^ nice.. download it, i can tell u this.. u wouldn't regret it! ^_^"
,muthineni,2010-11-20T04:29Z,"yeah guys its a good rip .thanks
8/10 . 
considering that this is only 500 mb,100 - 200 mb smaller than evryone else -maybe a 10 /10"
,greenteagod,2010-11-25T10:02Z,"Why even bother with ""720p"" It looks like a DVD rip. 3 channel audio.

For 500 megs it's decent though. "
,4u4u44,2010-12-13T13:48Z,"Im going 2 dwnld it now...

Thanx dude..."
