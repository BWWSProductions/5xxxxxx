PAL version of Epic Mickey for Wii. Tried it out on my softmodded 4.2U in USB Loader GX and loaded right up. not sure of any of the specifics required to get it to run, but worked fine on my unit with whatever CIOSes I already have installed. 

This is my first upload, hope everything comes out okay. Enjoy!
