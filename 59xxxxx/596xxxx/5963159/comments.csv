,RaiLiOn2,2010-11-17T19:28Z,How is the game? Any good?
,mgnthe54,2010-11-17T19:30Z,Jeu en Français & Anglais!
,GenEmperor,2010-11-17T20:37Z,How were you able to upload this game if it hasn't even been released yet? Can someone confirm if this is real?
,TerranRedneck,2010-11-17T21:16Z,"Most movies, music, games end up online before the release date... I dunno what kinda shenanigans leads to it but all it takes is one guy in the line of custody to rip a piece of software and it gets spread all over. 

I saw on vcdq.com that this was leaked so I did a bunch of hunting to see if I could find a copy. DLed, unzipped, slapped it on my external with WBFS Manager and tested it out.

I can't confirm that it will work on yer Wii, but it does on mine. If you've pirated software for the Wii before ya will know that every so often a game comes around that needs some special settings to run, but this booted right up from first click on mine with ""Force NTSC"" enabled. "
,Jangles90,2010-11-17T23:08Z,Does not work on Wode 4.3 just FYI
,javiayer,2010-11-18T05:23Z,does this work on ntsc?
,TerranRedneck,2010-11-18T15:12Z,Should work on NTSC. It does on mine...  Most loaders have an option to force a PAL game into NTSC.

,damienisxcore,2010-11-19T00:20Z,"Confirmed working with IOS249rev20 with Neogamma R9. Works perfectly, played through a couple levels. Very linear but what do you expect from disney.."

,magneteye,2010-11-19T15:15Z,not working on 4.3 with my D2CPro.
,mondo,2010-11-19T18:19Z,"Thanks...
Works perfectly on my PAL-Wii with Wiikey 1.

5+ hours in I must say it´s a great game.
The camera can be a bit annoying sometimes and the control is not spot-on, but it´s not all that bad.

8/10"
,aceman2010,2010-11-19T22:36Z,works on ntsc sofmod 4.2 with wiiflow.. played it for about an hour 7/10 not to bad

,almazrooei,2010-11-20T19:04Z,download direct download best !!!
,roc1hmr,2010-11-25T06:23Z,"have softmod 4.2u dowloaded game to a dvd-r, game loads in game channel looks nice but when i push start the wii says ""the disc could not be read. refer to wii operations manual for details."" have neogamma 9 screen goes green."
,sammacco,2010-11-25T07:57Z,F*ckin' great. Thank U sooooo much! :-D
,lastjedi,2010-11-27T05:41Z,can somebody please put this up in ntsc.
,tickled,2010-11-28T00:16Z,You shouldn't need NTFS if you have a softmodded wii. Just stick it on USB hard drive with WBFS and it should work. I didn't even have to Force NTFS (I'm using Configurable USB loader though.)
,gindy39,2010-11-28T10:23Z,"I download it and it works fine with Wiiflow on 4.2 I do have one question... is this game black and white at the start or something?... Since I begin the game the game is on black and white and I'm like 30 mins in and still B&W.  At first i though it was ok since Mickey use to be B&W but after some minutes the little helper started talking about colors and  thats when I found it odd that it was B&W so if anyone can tell me, I would appreciate it"
,kidroyal,2010-12-02T07:26Z,@gindy39 - The game is not in B&W from what I have seen.  Maybe you have the game forced to the incorrect region?
,tetsuh,2010-12-07T04:09Z,"Did someone try to update his system at launch of the game? I'm 4.3E and Wiikey 2, I don't know if to update is safe. And I don't know if it's possible to install Priiloader on 4.3..."
,tetsuh,2010-12-07T17:09Z,OK I've patched the ISO with WiiBrickBlocker and it works with my Wii w/ Wiikey 2 + 4.3E
