Mine came from several compliation CDs.
Spotnicks - Just Listen To My Heart actually sounds as if it is played at a different speed on this compilation.
Not sure what is going on, I can't accept that all mine are wrong. however this does say original recordings.
Just one of those things I suppose."
[T],keeybee,2010-11-17T15:59Z,"Well, I can only say that both the CDs with The Spotnicks Iâ€™ve uploaded states that they are only original recordings. Iâ€™ve listened to the Spotnicks for many years and find absolutely no reason to believe that they are not the original recordings. I know that the group made some re-recordings and they were released as â€œCharttoppersâ€ recorded 1977. (They might be released under various names since then).
Iâ€™ve downloaded some Spotnicks material myself, which is in various mp3 quality. They can have a  difference in sound. If that depends on the original quality of the CD or the ripping process is difficult to say. Compilations can be a nightmare since the quality on them can be from very good to very poor.
I hope you will enjoy my uploads and the special sound of The Spotnicks."
