The Spotnicks is an instrumental rock group from Sweden, who were formed in 1961. They were famous for wearing "space suit" costumes on stage, and for their innovative electronic guitar sound. They have since released 42 albums, selling more than 18 million records, and still tour.
The Spotnicks originated from Bo Starander and BjÃ¶rn Thelin's duo "The Rebels" (1956), who later became "Rock-Teddy and The Blue Caps", a group formed in 1957 in Gothenburg now with guitarist Bo Winberg (born 27 March 1939) in the band as well as Bo Starander (born 11 March 1942) (rhythm guitar), and BjÃ¶rn Thelin (born 27 June 1942) (bass guitar). In 1958 they added Ove Johansson (drums), changed their name to "The Frazers", and began playing regularly in local clubs. They signed a recording contract in 1961, and changed their name to "The Spotnicks", a play on the Russian satellite Sputnik as suggested by their
manager, Roland Ferneborg. Starander was later known as Bob Lander.
