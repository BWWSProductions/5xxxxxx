A young, fresh approach to the body language category, from an author who honed her skills working in the modeling industry
The Body Language Rules is a breakthrough in body language books. Unlike other guides that only focus on business uses, this book takes a fresh approach by showing readers how to decode body language for social, dating, and other practical purposes. This is a hip and edgy instructional from an author who honed her body language skills in the modeling industry.

Using fascinating psychological insights, plus a whole raft of down-to-earth quick-fix tips, James shows the reader how to use movement to:
Successfully project oneself
Read other people's body language
Get the job you want
Make friends and communicate with potential partners
Even how to date and how to kiss

Combining social, business, and sex signals, this is the ultimate guide to successful body talk...
