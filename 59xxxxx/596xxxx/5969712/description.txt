Miss Jade has called Danny over to her house to help her prepare Thanskgiving dinner for tomorrow. Her son is off working and so Danny comes right over. She explains about the variety of dishes that she needs to prepare and when she tells him this is an all day job.....he quickly loses interest. When he tries to make up an excuse and get away......she needs to figure something that will keep him around for awhile.
