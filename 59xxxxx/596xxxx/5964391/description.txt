Ok another Livepack from the PawnShop for all you ableton hip hop junkies....

Classic Breaks DrumMachines Vol 1 Kits 057 - 065 is a collection of drum kits created from my old Break beat record collection. sampled at 441k and arranged into drumracks to be played out via key or what have you. 

if you look in the project file in the samples/processed/crop file you will find the wave files of the classic drum breaks used to create these kits the waves are chopped into loops and ready to be used...

More kits to come in the future but this is the end of the classic Breakbeat kits Vol 1.... Enjoy.....
