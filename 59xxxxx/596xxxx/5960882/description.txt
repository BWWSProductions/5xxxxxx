From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with software engineer John Tyner, who was ejected by security from the San Diego airport after he refused the choice between a naked body scan and a crotch grope by TSA goons. â€œIf you touch my junk, Iâ€™ll have you arrested," Tyner told the TSA. Tyner is now the target of a TSA investigation and an $11,000 dollar lawsuit in an effort to shut down opposition to airport Gestapo zones. 
[2nd half of hour 1]

uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
