This torrent is for a dvdr of both Craig Ferguson Dr. Who Shows. 11/15/10-The Dalek appears and Craig talks to annoying guests about Dr. Who. 11/16/10 features Matt Smith and Chris Hardwick. Commercials are edited out as best as possible for a rush job. The dvdr is NTSC and formatted as a Video_TS file ready to burn with Roxio or similar programs. Smaller files may be posted if time permits. Since this is a public tracker and my connection is fast I don\'t think the size of this torrent is an issue. Enjoy!
