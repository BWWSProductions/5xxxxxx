,EvilOnee,2010-11-18T20:33Z,hey just curious dose the multilayer work in this one?
[T],GWpirateGW,2010-11-19T13:39Z,"tph, I have not even tried the MP but I am 99% sure it will not. Also, the reason I did not upload the zombie crack is cause it has a few false positives with virustotal.com and just did not wanna hear the newbies screaming virus virus. so people can use google to download the zombie crack-it aint hard to find.  but the crack that comes in this iso will crash the game if you try to play zombie mode"

[T],GWpirateGW,2010-11-27T20:01Z,"Step 1. download magic disc (free) and install it to use as a disc emulator 
Step 2. after the game installs, go to the game directory(should look like this:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Activision\Call of Duty - Black Ops on a 64 bit OS
C:\Program Files\Activision\Call of Duty - Black Ops on 32bit

Install the direct x manually

Step 3.

Now go to the emulated cd /dvd drive.
Right Click & open. Look for the folder called crack. you will see the files in that folder. copy them to your game directory(C:\Program Files (x86)\Activision\Call of Duty - Black Ops) replace when asked.

Now enjoy the game.

ZOMBIE MODE CRACK NOT INCLUDED.  the crack for this does not work on the zombie mode, it causes game to crash. You can find it on goo gle, there are working cracks around, the one i found has 4 of 41 hits for a trojan, but are false positives. I DID NOT include it, as so many newbies scream, virus virus virus, you can thank them & google it yourself.

I have  yet to upload the video tutorial to my you| |tube account under MrGWGProductions. I have over 77 messages asking for help, so im avoiding you| |tube atm=D

Sound issues. 44,000Mhz may cause the game to not play with sound. Change it to 41,000. Google how to change setting if you dont know how

Hope this helps some of you in need"

not sure why you got that,unless you tried playing a cracked game online or  sent them the error report,in which case that is your own fault. I never got that warning nor have most users...If you play it offline,you are good to go. Trying to play a cracked game online is like openly trying to record a movie in a theater. Nothing good will come of it"
