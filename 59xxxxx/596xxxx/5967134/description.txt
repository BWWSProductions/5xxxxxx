What is OgameAlerter ? It is a small but very useful tool, which allows you to be notified when someone attacks one of your planets on Ogame. How many times you loosed your fleet because you did not know that an attack was in progress? Now it is OVER. With this small tool, you will automatically receive an email message with information about attack! Just try it by yourself for free!
