                    The Fete.                                
                    Drama about an Indian doctor who moves to a  
                    Welsh mining village in 1963. The village of  
                    Trefelin is preparing for the annual summer  
                    fete, but there's a lot going on behind the  
                    scenes. Dr Sharma is preparing to leave the  
                    village for good, and Mrs Sharma goes in search  
                    of the missing Dan - but she finds more than  
                    she bargained for. Sharpe has been promoted,  
                    and Megan pleads with Dr Sharma to stay and  
                    help the miners fight for justice. The series  
                    builds to a climax as the doctor takes on  
                    Sharpe once and for all.
