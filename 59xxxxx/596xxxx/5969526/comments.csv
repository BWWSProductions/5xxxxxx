,southak,2011-03-09T09:39Z,Kindly explain how 528 lines is 720P ???
,l2torrent,2011-06-28T10:03Z,"@southak, I might be guessing here...
...but if the movie was of Wide-Wider Screen format, and width is at 1280px... (720p = 1280x720)
...Then height gets shorter. 
Stacking ""black bars"" to make the height fit the ""specification"" in cases such as these is pointless."

What is the sound by the way? AAC? DTS? I get error 404 clicking on the info file. "
