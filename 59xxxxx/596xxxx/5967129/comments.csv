,nufcnz159,2010-11-20T07:38Z,"GUYS, PLEASE SEED !!!!!!!!

it's at 0.4 kB/s I will seed once I get it !!!!!!!"
[V],pluto999,2010-11-20T11:36Z,"@tylr: The size is the shortest i can offer keeping the quality i wanna keep. 5.1 provides 5 channel audio. It won't make any difference unless you have a 5.1 audio system.

@all: kung fu panda.. well remind me after a week."
