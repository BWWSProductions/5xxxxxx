           Butch is a bounty hunter who just wants to get paid an         
           honest amount for an honest day's work; his chattel,           
           morally corrupt Rattler Fenton just wants to cash in on        
           his well hidden and - to hear him tell it - hard won           
           gold. As Butch navigates an increasingly magical West in       
           search of payment he is joined by a quirky band of             
           outcasts and outlaws -including beautiful, ferocious           
           Akemi - and terrorized by the entirely evil but not            
           entirely human Mondego gang. Through Butch we learn the        
           very real consequences of greed as he watches the pursuit      
           of the ecstasy of gold.
