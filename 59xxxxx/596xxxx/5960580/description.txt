Plot:

A sea turtle who was hatched in 1959 spends the next 50 years traveling the world while it is being changed by global warming.

Genre: Animation | Adventure | Director: Ben Stassen |
Starring: Melanie Griffith, Isabelle Fuhrman, Yuri Lowenthal, Anthony Anderson

Review:

The visuals in this underwater opus are top-notch and way better than Stassen\\\'s last effort \\\"Fly Me To The Moon\\\".

I also like the way Stassen tells the story from a turtle\\\'s eye view - which will go a long way in educating children on undersea life and protecting those creatures and our ecology. The movie is about a green sea turtle who is hatched in 1959 and spends the next 50 years travelling the world while it is being changed by relentless whale and shark fishing, pollution and global warming. Hours after being hatched, Sammy (voice of Yuri Lowenthal) finds and loses the love of his life, a pretty hatchling called Shelly (Isabelle Fuhrman of Orphan fame).

On the epic journey across the oceans that all turtles must accomplish before returning to the beach where they were born, Sammy dodges every danger in the hope of meeting Shelly again. On the way, he also has encounters with humans, both good and bad, as well as toothy sharks and piranhas.

It is easy to root for Sammy and his pals not only because they are cute but also because they are sporting and gutsy. With its story spanning over 50 years, Stassen marks the milestone periods with human events (like the hippies of the Sixties and the Greenpeace protests) and with classic songs on the soundtrack. Of course, the Beatles are represented with their hit, \\\'Across The Universe\\\' (what else?).

It is an entertaining sea-world documentary for the kids.
