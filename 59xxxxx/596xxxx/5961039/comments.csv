,DejaRayne,2011-01-30T01:32Z,"is there ANY of this movie that has hard-coded subs?!  i use (yes & love to use) Windows Media Player only...and srt files aren't read on it, so i cant get them to work..can anyone help me here, otherwise i think i'll just quit looking and give up on this movie..it was good, but u do miss alot with the russian & no subs.."
,SoulFirez,2011-02-05T12:04Z,"Bah forget media player try using media player classic home cinema edition (either 32 or 64 bit depending on ya system ) much better player it will play anything VLC will decent inbuilt codecs (but hey ya can always plugin externals but not needed for novice user as i said the inbuilt ones pretty decent.

PS cheers for the up downloading now to check it out sounds like people think it good quality 8)"
