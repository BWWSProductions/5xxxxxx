I've been waiting for a 1080p for like 3 months. I am really hoping this is in perfect state. Specialy because it's around 11 gigs. 

The screenshots seem promising. I will give a report on the downloadspeed and the quality after downloading.

Ofcourse I will be seeding this torrent like hell when done.

[T],FatFreddy69,2010-11-17T00:32Z,"@moshster
Lol, same here. 
These snap shots tell either of a very weak encoding, or simply the source isn't that great.
And 11 GB is a bad joke for this quality. Some blue-rays aren't that clear but then encode them to half size for God's sake with no quality loss.
Anyway in most cases the very first releases are of poorer quality (fast encoded), encoded in rush to be the first who uploads the BDRip, lol.
Honestly all my snap shots look much clearer even though my 1080p BDRips are encoded to 4-4500 kbps for Video) and saved under jpg not the ridiculously huge in size pgn (which pretends to be better quality in theory only of course ;-)"

I had to download for two full days. The download speed is a bit ""meh"" at the moment, specialy because this is such a big Torrent (11 GB). But this will increase as the more seeders come along.

To decrease file size, that black border can be cropped, so that the picture only shows the actual movie. That's why it's 800 px. The main thing is that the 1920 width hasn't been tampered with.

The guy who make this rip could have done a 1920 x 1080 rip, yes and what would have been the result? Exactly the same, you would have had black border in top and bottom. 

Did you ever heard about a ""crop""? There are black borders in top and bottom, the guy cut them, no need to let them in the movie. But in that case, the resolution is no longer 1920x1080 but 1920x800.

I have 100gb per month which means if I upload 50gb of stuff to others I can only download 50gb of stuff per month for myself. Torrents are all about sharing and I don't download that much due to not being able to upload, but don't you think you should share with the less fortunate?

@ pmfabri
.MKV is the standard for quality.
.AVI is for quick, small rips .. usually if the source is crappy to begin with. 
But when ripping from BD or DVD, the standard is .MKV or .MP4.

To stream .MKV in Windows Media Player:
Option 1: manually register .MKV Codec.
Google ""MKVs for Minimalists on Windows 7"".

Option 2 (recommended):
Google ""Shark007"".

I used to manually register my codecs because i just don't like installing unnecessary codecs. But i soon realize it takes atleast 5 or 6 different type of Codecs to play modern media. It's much easier to install Shark's; 1 pack and you're set. it covers all popular audio and video formats: i.e. FLAC, APE, .MKV, .MP4, Subtitles, etc. 

Search on Google about Shark007's Codec.
I usually would recommend steering clear of Codec Packs, but Shark's Pack is truly quality and practical."

,battleaxe89,2012-01-01T14:09Z,"I agree that anyone complaining about an mkv format needs to get a dose of reality on the popularity of vairying container files. However, I must make a correction that AVI's are simply for low quality videos. The container (extension) of the file has absolutely NO bearing on the quality of the video file in question. 
It is true that with many programs, different extensions give you different options for the quality of file. It is also true that MKV files typically have higher quality options than that of an AVI file. But the catch is that the quality of the container in question does not have any bearing on the actual container. The quality allowed in a container is determined by the program in question. With differing programs you can make and AVI file match the quality of any MKV file. The determining factors are your original video source and the encoding/ripping program. 
If you dont believe me, try it for yourself. Go and get the following programs (the first can be found on piratebay while the others are free) and give it a test:
Xilisoft (then choose whether you are ripping a DVD or a Blu-ray)
Handbrake

Enjoy, and make sure to always do your research before passing judgement!"

First off if your'e going to brag about your system specs, do it correctly. 

The CPU is an Intel i7 not 17, and Secondly you couldn't have 24GB of ram because Windows X64 only supports up to a maximum of 16 GB. 

Thanks again aoloffline for another great release! "
,murrcakes,2012-03-19T04:57Z,"@m00se1207

Actually, the 16 GB limitation is only in Home Premium on Windows 7. Professional/Enterprise/Ultimate are all able to utilize 192 GB of RAM."
