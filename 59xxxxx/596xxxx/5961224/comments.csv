[V],big_dad_e,2010-11-18T05:06Z,"Thought-provoking, violent, sarcastic and incredibly intense, Natural Born Killers is a disturbingly accurate and explicit satire on the media and modern society. NBK is a very intelligent film which requires the viewer's fullest attention if all the subtexts, some blatant, some cryptic, are to be understood. ~ Edinburgh University Film Society"

Super disappointed. 2.5 GIG yet the video is not crisp and sharp like other videos of the same file size. The movie also has added black bars on the left and right as well as the top and bottom. 
Sorry big_dad_e you missed the boat on this one. "
,BoonesFerry,2010-12-30T20:33Z,"Much appreciation for big-dad-e for the attempt...but for the downloader, don't waste your time and bandwidth on this one. 
Get this one instead: Natural Born Killers Directors Cut [1994] BRRip by ""neonrainbow"". It is slighter smaller in file size (2.25G) but 200% better in quality. It currently has only 15 seeders but is downloaded at a respectable 350 kB/s."

I notice complaints ALWAYS come from you leechers that offer nothing except your opinions.  Now go create some torrents of your own and put some booty on the table for the rest of us.  P.S.  Go buy it!"
[V],big_dad_e,2011-01-07T03:28Z,"BTW, you should update your codecs, or better yet, burn the file to a DVD and view it on a stand alone player instead of your bugged player on your crab infested machine."
[V],big_dad_e,2011-01-09T08:57Z,"neonrainbow always has good rips, but you can't compare DVDRip to a BDRip."
