,persimmon_66,2010-11-19T05:00Z,thank you very much!!!
,shimigami777,2010-11-19T09:42Z,"No problem. For future releases, try Demonoid first. It usually takes about a week for the new episode to come out.

Form now on though, if it's not uploaded to TPB I'll do it myself."
,reyhielo,2010-11-22T00:38Z,This is awesome. Thanks shimigami777!
,dinosaur58,2010-11-23T20:47Z,Thanks for these! What's the resolution? Saving the youtube videos [640x360] is tough on my system [security settings or something].
,merritt,2010-11-30T22:24Z,Don't bother with this torrent. All the files are named incorrectly and with the wrong embedded video titles. It was easy to just cherry pick these episodes. 
,shimigami777,2010-12-01T03:23Z,"That is not true. All of them are named correctly. Each has the episode title and number in it's file name.

Also, no one else uploads these to TPB regularly, so be happy I even bothered."
,pantsbassman,2010-12-27T22:18Z,"Very happy that you bothered, but it is true. shits all weird. one of em is titled tree trunks."
,shimigami777,2011-01-04T06:21Z,"Well I don't see how/why they are misnamed for you. I believe you, but when I re-downloaded this to check, all of them were named correctly in utorrent. And it is only 5 files, if names are that important to anyone it would only take a second to rename them."
