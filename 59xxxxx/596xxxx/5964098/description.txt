"Ilsa Pucci"

Picking up from the thrilling first season cliff-
hanger, Chance and Guererro stage a daring rescue 
of Winston from the hands of his torturous kid-
nappers. Two beautiful women join the team: 
billionaire philanthropist Ilsa Pucci, who fears 
for her life after the mysterious death of her 
husband; and Ames (guest star Montgomery), a 
chameleon-like master thief who inadvertently 
becomes involved with the plot to murder her new 
associate.
