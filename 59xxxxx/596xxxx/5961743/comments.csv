,Swanee1,2010-11-17T09:18Z,24 seeders and no quality comments yet????
,Saurov,2010-11-17T11:03Z,I'd wait for a better print.
,fellfrosh,2010-11-17T12:23Z,I'd wait for a better movie.
,The_Reasoner,2010-11-17T12:31Z,"This is the real thing, in english. v5 a7. kinda blurry and a little dark at times, but it's still watchable. some may want to wait for a better copy, especially with a CGI-heavy movie like this. but this seems to be the only copy available at the moment, so it's better than nothing. thanks, TvTeam!"

,pimpmobile,2010-11-20T04:57Z,"it's an ok movie, but the ending is something more to be desired.  they left it open as to make a sequel!"
,michaelrwatson,2010-11-20T22:35Z,"So is the ENDING of the movie actually missing, i.e. cut off this copy, or does the ending just suck because it's open-ended..?  (are any of the end-credits visible..?)  "
,michaelrwatson,2010-11-20T22:58Z,"THE ONLY two reasons to see this movie are entirely visual:  Scottie Thompson and the special effects, so i will wait for DVDrip.  Maybe it's at least a watchable flick in decent quality."
[V],bigbluesea,2010-11-21T00:03Z,"This movie is fucking retarded!
Any one who thinks this movie is good is a fucking tard"
,MasterFuse,2010-11-22T01:39Z,"Thanks for the up but...

A = 8
V = 6
M = 2

I'd read that it's a crappy movie but figured I'd judge it for myself. Yep, it's real crappy."
