,ZenRhino,2010-11-18T00:22Z,"this is missing some of the ending. imdb says the film is 92 minutes, not the 84 listed here. (probably with credits... but thats still 8 minutes diffewrence)

thanks for the up, but what about having the entire movie?"
,hauntnut,2010-11-20T04:48Z,"Rest assured, all, this is the entire movie. The file stops right as the end credits would begin to roll. As far as the quality is concerned, it's a cam, but it's a damn good cam. The image quality is sufficient to discern everything that takes place, while the audio, although a little harsh in spots, is overall pleasing. Thanks to the uploader!"
