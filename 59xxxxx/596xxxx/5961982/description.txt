Have yet to see this book out anywhere, so here it is.

This is the complete New Perspectives on HTML and XHTML Fifth Edition
I've found that it follows the fourth edition chapter to chapter, most things word for word.
I have removed the security, although for me acrobat still saw it as a "secure" file. However the file is completely usable with no limits. I have tested on two computers with 3 different programs and 2 operating systems.

A note to all:
I have a really slow upload limit on my network, I will continue to seed this, but in order for anyone to obtain real speed I will need other to help seed. So please continue to seed this for at least a week.

If there are any problems with the PDF please let me know and I'll do my best to fix it and re-upload. 

Thank you, and enjoy,
Yurdle
