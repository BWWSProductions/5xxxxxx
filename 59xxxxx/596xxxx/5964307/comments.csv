,MarkGibbons,2011-08-30T12:17Z,"Could you upload a ""Download & Play"" PS2 Emulator for iMac, It's impossible to find the 6 or 7 folders separately to get one lousy emulator working. It doesn't even work on the one in this download, because the bios+some extras need to be downloaded from somewhere. "
,njtsx,2011-09-05T18:10Z,"Sorry, I don't have a PS2 emulator... I uploaded everything I have."
,MarkGibbons,2011-09-19T14:42Z,"I'm wanting this extremely bad, however theres no seeders. I'll seed for a good 6 months if It downloads completely. Longer if the comments start Improving. My friend managed to download it awhile ago, I copied it onto my mac, but both our computers HDD's got reformatted, now we can't re-download from you. "
,MarkGibbons,2011-09-19T14:43Z,"Didn't notice my above comment, Back from when the torrent still had seeders. ^ -

However, I'll keep transmission open, and hopefully It'll be done by morning, still nothing though. "
