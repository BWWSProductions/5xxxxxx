,s3yk3y,2010-11-20T07:09Z,@mortarupload -Why don't u send this Audio to a scn group like iMAGINE or whatever? U can find their email on any of their nfo files. Let em know u have the audio n they'll probably sync it to their rls.. (oh and give u credit for it too :) )

,mortarupload,2010-11-20T07:16Z,"http://www.mega--pload  .com  /?d=6GDO05E0t 
is this torrent i just did it cause of the complaints"
,SaintOfMatine,2010-11-20T07:20Z,dude what happen to the speeds
,SaintOfMatine,2010-11-20T07:25Z,fuck scene groups most of them are bullshit anyways i can sync this shit up faster then them.
,Nyphot,2010-11-20T07:48Z,"Megau--oad says the file isn't there. I obviously haven't heard it, but if you need something to fix the noise, may I suggest Audacity (freeware) or N-Track Studio.

For N-Track make sure you have the compressor feature and select noise gate. You can easily adjust as needed."
,BubEdge,2010-11-20T07:59Z,"Really want this file, but the second link (without the spaces and hyphens) isn't working for me either."
,sdr93,2010-11-20T08:13Z,"If you download the torrent you'll get the ""No input file specified"" error but if you click on the magnet link you can download it no problem."
,mortarupload,2010-11-20T08:13Z,has any1 finished yet? I had to leave the pc. I dnt get much speed. This was recorded at the midnight showing 17th november. Split in 3 parts and missing 15 seconds plus the 36 mins. Recording this was a major risk.
,shazbaz12,2010-11-20T08:16Z,can u plz make another link
,shazbaz12,2010-11-20T08:17Z,thanks.. downloading with magent link :)

,huntyyyka,2010-11-20T08:35Z,"I used the magnet link, and I can download whit it. You should try it too."
,mortarupload,2010-11-20T08:45Z,can we get some quality comments?
,Nyphot,2010-11-20T08:59Z,"Thanks Hugo for the info and THANK YOU Mortar for the up!! I've got it and am seeding. 

There's three mp3 files. 18112010.mp3, 18112010(001).mp3, 18112010(002).mp3. 

I'm DLing the Spanish Cam. Going to try to run these through a noise gate and try to sync them with Premeire or Vegas. Operative word is ""try"". 

Never done this before. Probably should've started with something a bit less in demand. I'll let everyone know if I'm successful, but don't hold your breath. Naturally you'll get credit for supplying the sound, mortar :o)"
,mortarupload,2010-11-20T09:16Z,can i get an out of 10 rating? Lol. And a comment on whats wrong with it? So i know how to do my next one? I should have one up every thursday. A day before US gets em. Any requests? Ps. I only do audio and im 17
,mortarupload,2010-11-20T09:24Z,the spanish cam is lame. I cant sync it.
,jrdburrow,2010-11-20T10:14Z,"So, I have a non-english cam, and this.
How should I sync them together?  "
,keith23uk,2010-11-20T10:42Z,Thanks for this....if it would download! Just got denis stalker tracker on list and its offline! Trust me I have tried audio syncing in the past and it is not as easy as people think. Problems arise because the audio appears to run faster or slower than the video. Best to wait for someone else to do it as you get sick of seeing the movie before you have watched it properly.
,Narcissa666,2010-11-20T10:50Z,"I got this, thanks by the way, and the Spanish cam. I'd give this audio about a 5. No offense, but the shuffling mike and muffled portions are worse than most cam audio I've heard. Still, it's the only English audio I've found yet. I was able to keep within about 5 seconds by hand, someone with a talent for it could probably cobble together an almost decent cam out of this and the spanish vid if the video was better. (I'm **not** someone with the talent for it.)"
,mortarupload,2010-11-20T11:04Z,was this worth uploading?
,mortarupload,2010-11-20T11:07Z,il make sure my next one doesnt muffle and shift. It was a midnite premiere. So i had to keep it out of sight.
,Nyphot,2010-11-20T11:34Z,"@Mortar. Quit fidgeting and give that poor person a cough drop. Oh and sit up straight...lol.

There's only so much you can do with a condenser mic especially when you're trying to hide it. I took out the pops when you were moving it around (I'm guessing that you were trying to cover it up) and ran it through an EQ preset that I had previously made for condensers. 

I didn't want to run it through a noise gate because some of the quiter dialogue would've been lost. I was able to boost both the highs and lows a tad to make it a little bit more lively.

Now to try to sync it...I hope."
,keith23uk,2010-11-20T11:40Z,"Making this is 3 parts makes it even more of a knightmare to even to attempt to sync. You should have done it in one long part. Would be easier if you understood what they are saying in spanish too...
I am going to give up now I will just wait for someone else to release it."
,wdednh,2010-11-20T11:45Z,thank you for the upl
,mortarupload,2010-11-20T12:25Z,this was taken from my new phone after finding out it had great audio recorder.
,Nyphot,2010-11-20T12:27Z,"@Weload. Very cool. Out of curiosity, what did you use to edit? Premeire? Final Cut?"
,mortarupload,2010-11-20T12:41Z,i wana start my own group. Facebook if ur interested. Username: Mortarstudios haze. If i provide audio. I need people to EQ it. And edit it. Ps. My phne only does 1hr clips. So its hard. But i sit where i can pick up audio.
,Nyphot,2010-11-20T13:08Z,@Mortar Just sent you a request. Look for the guitarist with the American flag bg
,coolkarn,2010-11-20T13:39Z,how long is da clip????
,annoyingcyberman,2010-11-20T15:38Z,Found the Video but cant post the link here
,annoyingcyberman,2010-11-20T15:46Z,for people who cant download by the Download this torrent button use magnet link
,robo29,2010-11-21T09:37Z,Seems as though the denis.stalker tracker is offline and has been for awhile.  I'd like to give it a shot at filtering the audio if I could .
,danford,2010-11-22T08:18Z,Is this the same one what was on demonoid?
,Padr49904,2010-11-22T08:48Z,The english cam that is floating around seems to be missing a part so it's nearly impossible to sync unless you want to cut the audio out from that part.
