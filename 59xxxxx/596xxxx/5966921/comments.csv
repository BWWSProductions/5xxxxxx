,Wheezy,2010-11-19T04:49Z,"Thanks Ez, as always perfect upload!

Also TvTeam are just as good as Ez, no offense dude. 
I have relied on them many times when Ez is filled with leechers, or if for some reason Ez doesn't have an up of a certain old episode, I will trust TvTeam to provide me with the goods. 
They are pretty much the only two I trust hehehe."
,ears90,2010-11-19T05:09Z,"TvTeam is legit, but nothing beats eztv. "

,Avi001,2010-11-19T07:38Z,"Hey guys Thank you for ur good work.
I have a request.
Shows that are 42 min long are some 350MB (24,Lie to me...)
but I found that some torrents have file size almost half yet almost same quality.
so 22 min shows instead of 170MB may be we could have for 80MB. Please see if this can be done. Will b really good for all of us."
,Avi001,2010-11-19T07:39Z,"and same for 42Min shows too.
Thanks"
