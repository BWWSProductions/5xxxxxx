I did not imply that Israel is a religion but that the neo-conservative Jewish (which is a religion) lobby uses it's power in government to forward the cause for Israel. Anyhow, it has got you considering the issue which is the main point of the post. With respect to the 911 conspiracy theory, I am neither for or against but I think that anyone would agree that there is a few coincidences that should be looked at. Thank's for the comment."

Cheers."
