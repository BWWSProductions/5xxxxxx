Nena - 99 Luftballons [Hitparade 1983].VOB 



HQ very rare "Hitparade" tv show promo performance. The ZDF - Hitparade, or Hitparade for short, was one of the most popular and most well-known music television series by German TV channel ZDF. 

It was developed by Truck Branss and Dieter Thomas Heck and first broadcast on January 18, 1969. Subsequent hosts of the Hitparade were Viktor Worms (1985-1990) and Uwe Hubner (1990-2000). The last episode aired on December 16, 2000.

The rule was that each singer had to present his or her song live (to music from half-playback). Earlier musical TV-shows had already switched to full-playback. Also, with the exception of the pilot, each episode was live, which also was unusual. 

The most important innovation introduced by Dieter Thomas Heck was that the audience members had the chance to assert influence in the choice of musical artists. The viewers could select their favorite acts by postcard. 

"99 Luftballons" is a protest song by the German singer Nena. "99 Luftballons" reached #1 in West Germany in 1983. In 1984, the original German version also peaked at #2 on the American Billboard Hot 100 chart and the English-language version topped the UK Singles Chart. The German version topped the Australian charts for five weeks and the New Zealand charts for one week. 

The translation of the title is sometimes given as "Ninety-Nine Air Balloons", however "Ninety-Nine Balloons" is also correct. A Luftballon is a colourful toy balloon, rather than a balloon for transport or research.
