,critters30,2011-05-03T21:42Z,"Oh, and it is US version as well. Thanks for the upload!"
,bhutan_6,2011-08-03T20:34Z,Great torrent. Thanks. I have a request to everyone. Can you upload 2 rare Gamecube games (NTSC-U) Star wars rouge squadron 2: rouge leader and Prince of persia: sands of time in Piratebay. Thx in advance. Both of the games are in IGN's all time 25 best GC games list.

,Webberjo,2012-04-08T21:45Z,"Playing this game on my Wii with NeoGamma and DiosMiosLite. If you're thinking of doing the same, look out for 2 parts: 
The room with the elevator after beating the first boss (game will freeze if you run in too fast), and the room with a bunch of space pirates that are shooting at a larva (pipe on top floor loads slowly and you will fall through the map if you try to enter it before it has)."
