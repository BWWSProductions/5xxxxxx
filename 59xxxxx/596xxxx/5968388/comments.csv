I will resume uploading The Amazing Race (season 4) mid-January.

Have a great weekend!"
,undulat1,2010-11-20T14:24Z,"Thanks a lot for the great work, I really enjoy this! Any chance you could reseed season 3, episode 9? I missed it when you dropped it, and now I can't download it? Thanks!"
,DvdVeeken,2010-11-20T18:28Z,"I'm still seeding all episodes from season 2 and 3. Sometimes it gets queued though because I upload quite a few episodes a week, all from different shows. I'm sorry about that!
I'll keep an eye on it for you and try to keep  seeding that episode :-)"
,tpbriscit,2011-09-03T17:58Z,Any chance of a re-seed? This is the only 1 I can't find. It would be very much appreciated.
