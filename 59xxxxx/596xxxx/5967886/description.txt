This book contains a collection of general mathematical results, formulas, and integrals that occur throughout applications of mathematics. Many of the entries are based on the updated fifth edition of Gradshteyn and Ryzhikâ€™s â€Tables of Integrals, Series, and Products,ï¿½?though during the preparation of the book, results were also taken from various other reference works.

Review
The title.says it all: a compendium, of tables and formulas from various numerically and computationally orientated areas of mathematics, as well as extremely telegraphic summaries of some of the ideas involved. Recommended [for] upper-division undergraduates through professionals..............
