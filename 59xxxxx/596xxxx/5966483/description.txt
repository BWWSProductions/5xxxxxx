* fixed duplicate buttons when resizing screens
* zombie pigs and ghasts no longer get hurt by fire or lava
* fixed volume sliders now saving properly

Multiplayer fixes:
* hellworld=true no longer overwrites old save chunks. Player positions will still break if you switch it on a running server, though
* boats are now visible to other players
* minecarts move nicer
* fishing kinda sorta works, but needs more work
* sheep and cows look like sheep and cows now
* buckets work now
* fixed stairs being really difficult to destroy
* increased the timeout before â€œTook too long to log inâ€
* made it possible to ride carts and boats
* added (after lots of work) the ability to steer server-side boats
* added â€œno-animalsâ€ setting. if true, animals will immediately vanish
* added support for more animation settings. Currently itâ€™s just the â€œridingâ€ animation, but the same system will be used for sneaking


Upgrading?

*As this is a massive update. I highly recommend DELETING your old 
.minecraft folder before installing this one, you may exclude your "saves" folder
if you want to preserve your old SP maps*
UNPACK your RAR into your old .minecraft folder. 
Run Launch.bat files (Requires 1GB ram). Tada!


=======================================================

How to use HD texture packs?

Go into folder ".minecraft/Install HD Texture Packs"
Pick any .bat file... run it. and it new textures will be loaded the 
next time you launch MineCraft.


=======================================================

Quick Instructions:

UNPACK your RAR into %appdata% folder.
Make Sure you change "Your User Name" with your actual username

Windows 7: 
C:\Users\Your User Name\Appdata\Roaming\.minecraft

Windows Vista: 
C:\Users\Your User Name\Appdata\Roaming\.minecraft

Windows XP: 
C:\Documents and Settings\Your User Name\Local Settings\Application Data\.minecraft


That's ALL now Run "Launch.bat" or "Launch_x64.bat" to play!
If you have Win7 and 64bit Java with 4GB or more RAM you can run "Launch_x64_4GB.bat" (5GB or more required)


Works well ONLINE on ALL FREE & LEGIT Servers.
