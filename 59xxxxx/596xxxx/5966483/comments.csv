Obviously, this does not work online.
Offline is fine, however, though it gets lonely out there..."
,jakename,2010-11-20T01:07Z,copy it to your roaming folder and play it from there
,jakename,2010-11-20T01:08Z,"if u get tunngle, join the minecraft channel, and my server's ip is 7.7.187.63
u dont need a minecraft account for it"
,GoodTunes,2010-11-20T02:08Z,"@jakename 
Well, no friggen' duh. How else would I be playing the game in first place?
Again, you can't play this online."

What rubbish, this is great stuff. Many of the fixes and improvements are for MULTIPLAYER only. Everyone is using this online on my server!

Thanks Jakename & Kaen for this awesome release!"
,GoodTunes,2010-11-20T20:55Z,"@Rodef2099

Place it in your Roaming folder, start the .bat file, enter user name, log in, ""User is not Premium"".
Yeah, that's multiplayer for you."
,R0XYB0X,2010-11-20T21:01Z,"this shit don't work online, listen to the guy above me, it says your account is not premium.
followed the directions exactly. works fine offline, though"
,HunkH4nk,2010-11-20T21:11Z,"""Works well ONLINE""

doesn't work, you whore"
,2316816,2010-11-20T21:40Z,"Can someone help me with this? I put it in my roaming folder and run that .bat, input my user name, and it doesn't let me even log in.

Don't know if this is a problem, but the command prompt says ""java.io.filenotfoundexception"" when I boot up the .bat. Am I supposed to modify a file somwhere? Anyway, the online mode does not appear to work... :/"
,Rodef2099,2010-11-21T13:04Z,"You guys are pretty thick. If you did not pay for the game, online mode refers to servers running in ""offline-mode=true"" with ""verify-names=off"".

Is that too hard for you?"
,prismweed,2010-11-21T22:53Z,"goodtunes, your an idiot and you need to learn how to use the computer you mom bought u before trolling TPB and saying these files dont work.


 if your hosting the server and you dont OWN the game then wen you try to login youll get the message ""USER NOT PREMIUM"", to fix this go to your mincraft server folder and to the serverfile and set ""ONLINE MODE=TRUE"" to ""ONLINE MODE=FALSE"". this is so far in my opinion the best server software for this update out. thnx kaen for the build and thnk you jakename for the release"

This DOES work online. I know you say it doesn't, but you're simply wrong - happens to the best...

Obviously, if you haven't baught the game, then you WONT have a premium account, and WONT be able to login normally. 

This is how u play online with this release:

1. Download torrent, put the '.minecraft' folder in your Roaming folder (dunno where in XP).

2. Run 'Launch.bat', and enter you're desired name. NOTE: The 1st box that asks u ur name is the NAMECHANGER, and does not come with the 'legit' version.

3. You should come to another screen, asking you to login (username/pass). Leave everything EMPTY, and click Login.

4. It'll give an error, and ask a question.. Choose the 'Play Offline' option...

Do that everytime u wanna play MC. After step 4, you can play Singleplayer, AND Multiplayer. 

For Multiplayer after step4, click Multiplayer button, and just put in an IP to a server. (Usually atleast 80 ppl on MC tunngle room, get tunngle and ask for IP).."

,Warghanen,2010-11-23T22:06Z,"Please help!!!
