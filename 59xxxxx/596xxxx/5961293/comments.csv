,Rawrxs,2010-11-17T04:12Z,"@Albien214 Zero Percent was released separately from the album, so i downloaded that about a week ago. As for the rest, the album is technically in stores today, but just not on the shelves ;) Oh, and Your Welcome =D"
,stonesour025,2010-11-17T06:36Z,"Rawrxs, can you up a FLAC encode if you have the CD?

Thanks in advance!"
,Rawrxs,2010-11-17T06:58Z,"@stonsour025, umm....No. I hate FLAC, and i don't want to encourage something that i do not like. sooo....there is your answer. Maybe in the future, but thats doubtful too, most people don't download flac, because its not able to be played on most portable mp3 devices."
,SlideXII,2010-11-17T07:35Z,The album is amazing. I'm seeding just because it's that's good!
,Albien214,2010-11-17T08:27Z,"First thing I've ever seeded as well (even though there's plenty now); sounds amazing so far - or as my Metallica-loving friend put it, ""less pussy-ish"". "
,Rawrxs,2010-11-18T04:45Z,Thanks for seeding guys!
,w29,2010-11-20T16:11Z,"The quality of mp3 is crappy, the quality of FLAC is perfect. Most mediaplayers are able to convert FLAC to mp3 while synchronizing. So that's no excuse."
,Rawrxs,2010-11-25T08:56Z,"@ w29, Yes I know, but never the less, people don't download flac as much as they do mp3. I uploaded this for the majority of the people, not the prissy people who say that mp3 quality is really bad. What i recommend, is getting some better speakers or headphones because odds are that the people who complain don't even have high enough quality gear to be able to hear the difference. Oh, and flac also takes up a hell of a lot more room. Lastly, if media players convert it to mp3, then why does it matter to begin with? do you know someone who carries their computer around as an audio player? I didn't think so. So, your point is not valid, unless you spend $100's on your computers audio set up. And if you could afford that then you probably wouldn't be pirating music either."
,PhilFFX,2010-11-28T22:08Z,thx dude
,PhilFFX,2010-11-28T22:11Z,"and that's soo true about flac haha, flac sucks hairy balls
mp3's the way to go
like really, if i had all my music in flac, i would have to have a 5 TB hard drive lol.. waste of space"
,demondj0220,2010-12-16T07:45Z,"I prefer mp3 over flac for two reasons: flac files rarely work, and they take up too much space."
,imirajtpb,2011-10-15T03:14Z,"lol ignorance. flac much higher quality than MP3. MP3 files are lossy, flac is lossless. This means that no sound quality is lost from converting files from the cd to FLAC, but quality is lost from converting to MP3. Though i agree with you guys that FLAC is far too large to fit onto portable music players, there are many music enthusiasts, DJs, radio stations that would prefer FLAC over MP3."
