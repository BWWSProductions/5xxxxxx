,enonumus,2012-02-26T23:50Z,"A9/V9.  Was looking to replace my high quality H.264 DVD-RIP with a high quality 720p version, but the quality of this file was no better than my DVD-RIP, and the color quality was nowhere near as good.  2GB for a 720P XVID movie that's over 2 hours long is just way too small.  That would be about perfect if encoded with AVC, but XVID takes twice the file size to come close to the same quality, and the ancient DivX 5 codec that was used on this is very outdated and not suitable for 720P.  The audio is only stereo MP3, but with an unusually high bitrate for a 2 channel audio track (256 Kbps), which is just a waste of data bits that would've been better used on the video.

Overall, the quality is certainly fine for watching, but don't expect anything better than middle of the road DVD quality.  Thanks for the upload, but I deleted it."
