[T],prathaprabhu,2010-11-20T01:45Z,"It is not activated - it requires a valid key or you can use the activator which can be found in here.

Also I need seeders I ain't going to re-upload this once again.

,GoodSpeed2011,2010-11-20T01:57Z,"Not activated.
First, I downloaded next file(english version) and installed.
Microsoft Office 2011 14.0.0 Final for Mac (Volume Licensed)
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5850094/Microsoft_Office_2011_14.0.0_Final_for_Mac_%28Volume_Licensed%29
Next, I downloaded japanese version here and installed it over.
Then it was transformed to japanese version and was fully activated.
Working great.
Thank you for nice torrent."

Lyssna noga: 
installera FÃ–RST DEN SVENSKA dmg filen UTAN att aktivera den  och undvik internet.
SEN installerar du Microsoft Office 2011 14.0.0 Final for Mac (Volume Licensed)

For our dannish firend:
First you have to install YOUR dannish version and after that avoid intertnet, ti will say it needs to be activated. 
Close the application. 
install this english version over your dannish  Microsoft Office 2011 14.0.0 Final for Mac (Volume Licensed)
NOW it will work.
I tried it twice and it works  like a charm.
