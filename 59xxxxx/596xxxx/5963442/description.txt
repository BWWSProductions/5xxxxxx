Double CD Anthology from Legendary Chilean Folk Singer-songwriter/Political Prisoner Includes Unreleased Tracks. Victor Jara Packed a Lot of Living in his Incredibly Short Life. He Lifted Himself from the Poverty of his Youth by Joining the Army and Eventually Putting Himself Through School. His Life Changed in the 1960's When He Met Violeta Parra, a Traditional Folk Singer and the Owner of a Santiago Cafe Where Jara Would Perform Regularly. Parra Took Him under her Wing and Nurtured his Songwriting Talent, which He Used for his Heartfelt Political Expression. He Recorded Several Albums in the Late 60's and Early 70's that Found a Wide Audience. Jara Though Would Never Enjoy the Fruits of his Labors, as He Met a Dark Fate at the Hands of Dictator Augusto Pinochet's Forces in their Coup Against Salvador Allende. It is Said that Despite Having his Hands Tied (Or Amputated as Alleged), Jara Kept Singing Constantly Until a Soldier's Bullet Finally Silenced his Heart.
