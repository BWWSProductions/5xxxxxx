Stewart Francis is the Canadian comic famous for 
his razor-sharp one-liners and impeccable sense of 
timing. A TV regular on programmes such as Mock the 
Week, Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow and Live At 
The Apollo, Stewart has established himself as serious 
hot property on the comedy circuit, recently supporting 
Ricky Gervais as part of his Science tour. In his brand 
new, debut stand up DVD, Stewart brings us his Tour de 
Francis... a scenic ride full of gags from his fantastic stand-up tour.
