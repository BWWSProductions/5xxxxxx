,dothackjhe,2010-11-21T08:51Z,Where does the downloaded trial version of bitdefender 2011 goes? I tried downloading the trial version of Bitdefender 2011 Total Security but I can't find it anywhere. . 
,dothackjhe,2010-11-21T09:54Z,"The patch is working! ^___________________^ Thanks Box! ^_____________________^

I had encountered problem installing the trial version of this software using the included downloader of BitDefender 2011 Total Security --- the installer doesn't appear after fully downloading the installer. I used the one at BitDefender's website and and everything worked fine. "

,trex2strike,2011-01-21T12:42Z,I installed it long ago but there seems to be problem. Bitdefender doesn't show scan logs of any type but confirms the system to be infected. Any Help?
,BloodZero,2011-01-21T16:32Z,"Works like a charm! (Windows 7 64-bit)
Awesome upload! Thanks a lot!

Since I don't know if it's ok to let BitDefender update, I'm blocking it using another firewall. There should be a way to just disable it, but since I like my other firewall and BD doesn't detect it during installation as a possible conflict...
Anyway, for anyone else unsure about the updates, just download the appropriate manual Virus Definitions Update file from here:
http://www.bitdefender.com/site/Main/view/Desktop-Products-Updates.html
The web page says ""Products Updates"", but when you run the file, it says ""Definitions Updates"", so I'm assuming it's the latter."

,Tatletz,2011-02-14T08:05Z,"@hipnie: Dont you worry mate, cracks and keygens are often recognised as viruses. Just install the product you want and apply the trial reset according to the instructions and you will be fine."

,Unknown16,2011-05-22T01:32Z,"Hey, thanks for the upload. But anyway I've had this AntiVirus since well March-ish and only recently I have had pop ups by BitDefender saying that the trial has expired and it requires to be ""Bought"". (Ironically) I have clicked on it and it does take me to the BitDefender website, so no AdAware there. Not to forget that BitDefender has shut itself off for no reason as well, like in the Hidden Icons in the bottom right corner of my screen, when hovered over it just disappears. Any recommendations or would I have to try and find a solution? :D"
,eeijas,2011-05-24T15:34Z,"Thank you so so much for the upload RobbingHood!

Quick question: When BitDefender updates, can I get caught using a pirated version? 

Thanks in advance!"
,eeijas,2011-05-24T15:46Z,"@RobbingHood

Btw I've set it to 'Automatic Update' and everything seems to work great. I'm just worried if they can detect a pirated version when BitDefender updates.

Thanks in advance!"
[V],RobbingHood,2011-05-24T23:42Z,"@eeijas

The crack may not work due to a future update, but no need to worry about using a pirated BD."
