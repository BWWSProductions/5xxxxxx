Very good quality DVDrip. I don't really care about the movie, which is barely watchable (I watched 10 minutes of it with great difficulty). My only justification for doing this rip is that a proper DVD rip for this movie isn't available anywhere. I tried downloading a decent rip, downloaded several, and all were bad. Hence this one.
