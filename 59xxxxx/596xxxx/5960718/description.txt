DAVE BRUBECK  JAZZ IMPRESSIONS OF NEW YORK
Label:Sony
Format:Flac



Recorded in New York, New York between June 16 and August 21, 1964. 

This 1964 concept album, featuring pianist Dave Brubeck's greatest quartet, presents music culled from Brubeck's scores for the CBS television series Mr. Broadway. Although long forgotten, the program yielded some of the composer's most memorable works.

It's amazing how well Brubeck captures the vibe of New York City, especially given the fact that he is a California native. But Brubeck knew the Big Apple well, and his ability to invoke the mood and overall atmosphere of New York is uncanny. This is especially apparent on the sprightly waltz "Spring in Central Park," which conveys a blithe, carefree spirit. Other pieces, particularly "Lonely Mr. Broadway," are more somber, revealing the dejection sometimes associated with life in the big city. Alto saxophonist Paul Desmond is in fine form here, as are drummer Joe Morello and bassist Gene Wright, and together they incite terrific group interplay. Brubeck himself performs unrestrained solos on many of these outstanding tunes, most notably on the upbeat "Summer on the Sound."
