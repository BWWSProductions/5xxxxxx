This exact same torrent is posted at Demonoid by accursed2010, having removed
some info. As a matter of fact this torrent now has already been scraped by
many torrent indexers and reposted by others at lots of different torrent sites."

[V],RobbingHood,2011-02-03T23:59Z,"@RBFC3027

The described problem is probably caused by BD itself."

Of course it's a false positive, otherwise this torrent would not be here.
