Blondie - Sunday Girl [TopPop Golden Years 1978].VOB



HQ rare tv show promo. AVRO's TopPop The Golden Years was a Dutch television program that, between 2008 and 2009, was broadcast via Netherlands 3 NPS. TopPop Golden Years brings back unique archival material from legendary TopPop broadcasts. 

The series consisted of thirty minute episodes with clips from the original TopPop television program from the 70s and 80s. The broadcasts were built around themes from disco to funk, from glasses and mustaches to eroticism and from reggae to rock.

The original TopPop presenter Ad Visser has a very brief cameo beside the clip window. The clips have a few temporary trivia text bars at the bottom of the screen in dutch. There is also a small white "n p s" text to the top left, and a small green box to the top right, both outside of the clip window. 

"Sunday Girl" was a UK number-one single by Blondie for three weeks in May 1979. It was Blondie's second UK number-one single after "Heart of Glass"; it was, however, never released as a single in the US.

The song was written by Chris Stein and was the fourth single to be taken from the album Parallel Lines in the UK and most other parts of the world.
