Period comedy drama set in 1963. When their local doctor passes away, the residents of a sleepy Welsh mining village are surprised by the arrival of his replacement, Prem Sharma, who has arrived from India. And it's not just the locals who are shocked; Prem's regal wife Kamini isn't too happy with the situation either. Life in the village is centred around the pit, and the Coal Board's local manager Richard Sharpe is keen to welcome the new arrivals - but he also has a few skeletons in his closet.
