Mona Charen's book Useful Idiots is a profound analysis of the American left with regard to their regular denunciation of America and acceptance of almost anything except western civilization.  It primarily focuses on Communism and the communist revolutions around the world.  American leftists repeatedly embraced those movements as pure, despite widespread, even genocidal murder, and the general travesty of totalitarianism and economic suppression.  With the documentation in this book, it is clear, the American left believes in elevating ideas to be supreme, even if that means people go by the wayside or are trampled under foot.  Many other books provide evidence, but few are as line-by-line packed with evidence, from the mouths and pens of leftists, themselves.
