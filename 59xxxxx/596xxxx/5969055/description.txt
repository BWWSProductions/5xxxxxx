The Shape of Punk to Come [Deluxe Edition] 2010

I've only uploaded the live disc because I figure you've already got the first disc anyway. And if you don't, there's only about a million torrents on this site alone for it. 
It took me ages to find this online and it was only in .rar format, so I've just gone ahead and extracted it into a convenient .mp3 format for you, so enjoy!

I'll seed this for as long as I can, and you should too. There's nothing more annoying than not having enough seeders.
