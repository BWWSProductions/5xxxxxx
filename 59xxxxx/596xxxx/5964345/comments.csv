,Joker-Face,2010-11-18T08:11Z,"Finished Downloading, Video is great, 9/10. If it's green for you, play it on DIVX not Windows Media Player. The audio is as titled, cam audio I give it a 6.5/10 for audio. Thank you for uploading .BONE."
,Joker-Face,2010-11-18T08:23Z,"To add, I recommend the download, it's the best quality available. Took 20 mins to DL very fast. Thanks again Bone."
,weaping_reaper,2010-11-18T10:27Z,"Okay.. After watchin an hour of this I can say.. It is very good Video, but the audio really throws me.. I know it took a long time to do what .BONE. did in synchronizing this, but its still not good enough to watch all the way through.. anyone that really wants to see this now.. DL it, just to get a taste of whats to come... Overall, great upload, he was first...

RESPECT!!!"
