History

Xbox World 360 began life as Xbox World, with issue one released 
in early 2003, over a year after the Xbox's release. Published by 
Computec Media, the editor at launch was Pat Garratt (now of Eurogamer), 
and the managing editor was former CU Amiga editor Tony Horgan.

Xbox World, alongside sister magazine PlayStation World, was acquired 
by Future Publishing in late 2003. The majority of the staff departed 
during the magazine's move from London to Future's Bath offices. 
The editor for the first Future-published Xbox World was Lee Hall.

In September 2005, Xbox World relaunched as Xbox World 360 under the 
guidance of former NGC editor Tim Weaver. It contains an achievements
-hint-cheats-walkthrough book and a double sided four-hour disc 
including a DVD side and a HD side to be ran on the Xbox 360 via 
the media blade.

Enjoy.
