,papayrus,2011-01-06T16:42Z,This works fine but one thing. I can not save it as an image or print it. It says its only available in the full version. The start up nag screen went away after putting the key in though and it works but I have to take a screenshot of the final image to print it. Anyway to enable the save as image and print option?
