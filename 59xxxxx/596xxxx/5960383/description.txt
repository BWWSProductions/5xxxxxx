                    The Diary.                               
                    Drama about an Indian doctor who moves to a  
                    Welsh mining village in 1963. A couple of weeks  
                    have passed since Dr Prem Sharma and his wife  
                    Kamini arrived in Trefelin, and colliery  
                    manager Richard Sharpe is still desperate to  
                    find a mysterious diary left behind by Prem's  
                    predecessor, Dr Elwyn. But Sharpe's plan to pay  
                    local street urchin Dan Griffiths to steal the  
                    diary from the surgery backfires when Kamini  
                    catches Dan red-handed. While Kamini confronts  
                    Sharpe, Prem has an emergency of his own to  
                    deal with when he's asked to make a very  
                    unusual house call.
