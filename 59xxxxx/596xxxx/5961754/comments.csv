,ahmed919,2010-11-21T01:26Z,THIS WONT WORK NO MATTER WHAT YOU TRY RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE TO WAIT TILL EA GIVES A PSN UPDATE FOR THE GAME BEFORE IT GETS CRACKED TO RUN ON 3.41
,Kevin925,2010-11-21T19:20Z,"Just started downloading. But when I d/l Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, it was 3.50. What I had to do was install the game files first, basically the installation patch. Google around for ""Hot pursuit ps3 patch"" it'll be in a .pkg file and be called ""BLESxxxxxx..."" not ""BLUS"" or ""BLJS."" The third letter in a game's id number is the region, and this is a euro game.

Find the patch, download the retail, not the debug."

,sham021,2011-01-07T03:59Z,"to get the game working you must extract with UltraISO and NOT winrar as winrar does not extract the ISO fully.....and then you just patch the eboot.bin and FTP it to your PS3 hard drive and then use a backup manger like  multiMAN and run the game under patch mode and then run the game with a Bluray disc inside and it should be working now.

and remember to use ""Hermes v4b (3.55 spoofing),for 3.41""

PS. dont install the update."

,LeecherSeeder,2011-01-21T22:10Z,"What you need to do to get this game to work on PS3 3.55!!!

Go to youtube and type in 
""How To Install Wutangrza CFW on PS3 - Backups On 3.55""

-Christ techtv explains it real well also provides all the links to what you need"
,Morphined,2011-01-23T12:10Z,"1) Unpack rar somewhere.

2) Transfer the folder to the directory your backup manager uses (either Games, Gamez or some other)
2.a) PS3 doesn't digest NTFS, so you better use FTP transfer (install FileZilla on your PC and BlackBox FTP on the PS3)
2.b) If you have a nice and large external memory device with FAT32 file system, just copy it there, plug into your PS3 and use some kind of a file manager (MultiMan will do) to copy the game from usb to the folder your backup manager uses.

3) Launch your backup manager on PS3

4) Find your game in the list

5) Press LOAD.
5.1)Note that you sometimes need to have a legitimate blu ray inside the PS3

6) Exit to XMB

7) Launch the game that should be loaded by now and look like it's on the bluray you have inserted earlier.

8) Have fun!
8.1) If you have some crashes and hangups - don't panic. Pull of the cord from your PS3 and reinsert it. It happens every now and then, but it's totally fine."

,michaelkbh,2011-03-22T08:46Z,@frozoman : You can not update your jailbroken games with the automatic update on the PS3. If you do anyway the game will not work anymore but your PS3 and the hack will be fine. If you want to update JB games you must download the game update as pkg and run it on a USB drive. You can get update pkg-files on http://yifan.lu/psn/ for example. Just enter the game id and download the pkg.
