,pika1979,2010-11-24T02:00Z,I use a cyclods evolution with fully up graded firmware and the game plays fine up to a point. The game was saving fine but it kept freezing. After the third crash the game stopped saving. I have deleted and download several different sites and now none of them will save.

Thanks anyway ^^"
