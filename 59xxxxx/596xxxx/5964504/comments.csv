,Mauler1,2010-11-21T02:13Z,"Only 1 dude had commented on the quality, can a few other ppl have their input pls!"
,RWAB,2010-11-21T04:48Z,"Why don't you download it and post the quality? Because if you did, you wouldn't feel like coming back to post. Now you know why no one else does."
,geek.maan,2010-11-21T13:15Z,"it cant be...! audio is not from a R5! appears to be a recording from a cinema/theater. Video is however quite watchable. 

video 7/10 audio 3/10"
,sjgidman1982,2010-11-21T17:56Z,this is Telesync not R5 - Picture is Ok but audio is quite poor
,MoonManta,2010-11-21T18:27Z,"Video: 9
Audio: 5

Video is great quality, but the sound is rather tinny.

Thanks Hero!"
,roy_thuis,2010-11-22T10:27Z,"Audio isn't that great and it is nog sync with the video. But look to the other side, it is so soon"
,war59312,2010-11-23T01:20Z,"Audio is out of sync most of the movie. :(

What a shitty ass group to release such poor quality."
,gizmo203,2010-11-23T20:43Z,A 5 V7 sound alittle funny.  but very watchable good upload..
,jantje411,2010-11-24T22:15Z,"Video: 9
Audio: 4

"
,Phatfish,2010-11-25T20:23Z,"Video is so so but OK.

Audio is pretty bad cam, but uou can clearly hear what they say and it isn't terribly distorted like a lot of other cam audio. So it's watchable I guess.

Thanx 4 the upload!"
,GAVB,2010-11-26T23:30Z,"I wish they would wait, why ruin your rep uploading a tinny cam rip of a 3d film? dont get me wrong i appreciate it, the audio is out of sync, not just out of sync but out of sync all over, just when i get it in sync with vlc its out again in the next scene, what's the point, might as well have no audio."
,xTyler,2010-11-27T20:52Z,Is this the one with the very badly synced audio?
,murrambingi,2010-12-06T13:13Z,"thx for the upload hero no 1,
V=7
A=5
Audio is out of sync in areas and sounds a little bit like it was recorded in a tunnel, but it was watchable and the movie its self was gruesome and an improvement on the last one :)"
,relicteam,2010-12-10T15:10Z,"V-8
A-3 (Sounds Like Cam)

Some Parts is out of sync

,pwince,2010-12-16T15:09Z,"Crap audio...sounds lyk a cam...
