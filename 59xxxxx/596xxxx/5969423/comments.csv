,Ravenous_Syn,2010-11-26T03:47Z,I copied the crack file to the directory folder and it still in evaluation version. What did I do wrong?
,ardiyookit,2010-12-06T07:37Z,"awesome, i had already installed it from their site, so i just dloaded your crack. got rid of the file of the same name in the directory and replaced it with yours. works a treat thx"
