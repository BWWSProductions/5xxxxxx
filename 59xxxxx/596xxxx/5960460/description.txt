Reviews:

"...a rare find, recorded in 1994 in Queens, NY, incredible ensemble of players accompany Sara's voice and 4 string guitar on this live to disc recording. Many special moments and original takes of some of her best-known songs and vocal techniques. This CD is a must for the Sara K. collection."
(CD Universe)

"...wonderful vocals, sparse backings and enough atmosphere to justify a film of the album..."
(Hi-Fi News & Record Review)

"...what you want is something peaceful, yet emotionally invigorating..."
(The Audio Adventure)

"The Santa Fe singer/songwriter sends out lyrical tendrils that attach themselves to the listener so an exchange of emotions can take place..."
(CD Review, Women in Music)

"...intimate folk in an austere acoustic setting...With the sparest backdrop of guitar, bass, and light percussion, Sara's vignettes are personal and romantic, spun from a calm center that can only house those with the sense to find it...Thanks to the flawless production, Sara sounds as if she's playing right in your living room."
(Alan Orski, New Review, Summer 1996) 

"...at once romantic and warm, as well as lyrically chilling and stark. As always, her "sound" is wholly her own - a distinctly hushed and warm tone fingering a flamenco guitar strung with low end strings. File Sara K. under vocal folk jazz with panache."
(Alex Boyd, Leak, Winter/Spring)
