,assbastro,2011-02-23T05:42Z,"The install seems to work, but at the last second does an error. I'm making sure all other programs are closed as per the instructions. If anyone has a fix please do share.

I'm running osx 10.6 fwiw. "
,assbastro,2011-02-23T05:53Z,"Actually, I guess never mind. I just had to download the update via the Red Giant site directly, and use the serial from the package to do the install."
