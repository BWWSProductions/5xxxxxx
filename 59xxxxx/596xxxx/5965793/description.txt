State-of-the-art video noise reduction, out of the box

Don't settle for noisy video. 

Magic Bullet Denoiser does it allâ€”professional results with no fuss. Traditional noise removal methods can blur fine detail, but Denoiser's advanced technology retains definition while eliminating noise.


Highlights

No Noise, No Fuss

Apply Denoiser and get results immediately. Tell Magic Bullet Denoiser whether camera motion is slow or fast, set a single slider, and you're ready to go. Denoiser is faster than After Effects' built-in de-noising feature, and yields superior results with less blurring and better preservation of fine details.

High-Quality Results

Noisy, grainy footage distracts viewers from the story you're trying to tell. Don't worry about low light: keep shooting, knowing that you can make that video clean and smooth when you're safely back indoors. Magic Bullet Denoiser delivers results that surpass the rest.

Powerful Motion Estimation

High-speed camera movements require different handling than slow pans. Denoiser compares successive frames to learn what's natural motion in the scene and what's noise, preserving detail even in fast-moving action sequences. If you'd like to fine-tune the controls, you can set sample frames, change offsets, or enhance shadow or highlight regions.

One-Step Noise Reduction
Denoiser works so well out of the box, you might never need to use the individual control sliders


Motion Estimation For High- and Low-Motion footage
Denoiser's unique technology compares where pixels have moved between frames to discriminate between what's actual noise and what is natural motion in the scene, preserving fine detail even in high-motion shots.

Smart Noise Fingerprinting
Multiple blocks in the image are analyzed to build a noise fingerprint. Set the slider to a higher value to tell Denoiser to look for more noise.

Fine Tuning
Pull out individual channels to fine-tune noise reduction without exposing banding artifacts with the unique chroma smoothing control
 

Separate film and video modes
Video mode allows you to fine-tune luma and chroma offset and chroma smoothing, while film mode (ideal for material that was originally shot on film) offers separate adjustments for red, green, and blue channel offsets

Shadow highlighting
Focus noise reduction on shadows or highlights (or de-emphasize them)

One Step Image Enhancement
Restore detail and fine edges with built-in image sharpening.
