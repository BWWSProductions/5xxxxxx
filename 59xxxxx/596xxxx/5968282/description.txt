Or, the way things workd before we invented God.

The hilarious fourht libe smash hit stand up show from 
Ricky Gervais, following his complete sellout tour - filmed 
live at London's Hammersmith HMV Apollo.

Never afraid to challenge comedy boundaries, Ricky is renowned 
for his acerbic observational humour and cutting delivery. 
Set on a stage designed to look like Frankenstein's castle 
laboratory, this show brings together thought-provoking rants 
and tongue-in-cheek political incorrectness about subjects as 
diverse as religion, racism and obesity.
