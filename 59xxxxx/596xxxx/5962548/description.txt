    Who killed the brother of Sal? The neighbors think it's Sal himself,     
    who's just been released from prison and returned home to reunite        
    with his sibling. But Sal was at the pizzeria picking up an order at     
    the time of the murder. Two cops are on Sal's case, determined to        
    send him back to jail, so he takes it upon himself to discover the       
    true killer -- which leads him to explore a sadomasochistic world.
