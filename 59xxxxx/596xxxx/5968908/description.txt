PLOT:


Angela (Milian) always wanted the perfect Christmas. But for her, anywhere is better than home for the holidays. When she receives an antique snow globe as a gift, it shakes up her life and transports her to a magical world where it's always Christmas. Now, she'll have to choose between the man of her dreams and the one she never imagined possible. It's a new kind of holiday romance !
