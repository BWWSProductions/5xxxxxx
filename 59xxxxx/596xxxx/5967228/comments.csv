,dkhere,2010-11-19T12:41Z,Any way you can upload the 700MB version???

,Renegade1970,2010-11-21T00:23Z,this version also has the constant hiss in the audio like the 700MB version by twizted.  video is good though
,jambuban,2010-11-21T01:33Z,"the video and audio is quite nice onthis print, but can anyone provide eng subs for this one..?
it would be a grt help.
thanks to the uploader, piracy rocks!"
,dungrani,2010-11-23T16:27Z,"Enjoyed the Super quality of the video file, super video quality & equal audio. I downloaded ""The social network"" from so many different sites but all were bogus. It used to ask for some of the codecs & then the movie player (coral or windows media player) & so on, 

Finally i landed on this page where i got which i wanted.

Thanks a ton"
,Mewable,2010-11-24T20:52Z,Any Watermarks?
,AznAssassin,2010-11-27T13:20Z,"I hope all these positive comments r tru because I terrible wasting over 1 GB for a cam version of a movie when all the other versions r under 800MB. 

If it is indeed great visual and audio (well, for a cam tat is), I will be endorsing this :)

brb until it finishes!"
,Necrofilo,2010-11-29T05:43Z,"V - 5
A - 3"
,imad81,2010-12-01T16:18Z,the screens look promising..thanx in advance Hero_No_1
,imad81,2010-12-02T11:01Z,"No watermarks in this one.

However there is a constant hiss in the audio. If you are using VLC then change the audio option to 2 pass processing and the hiss is reduced considerably.

again thanx for a great upload."

,nofuckingusername,2010-12-09T09:11Z,"I don't know what all you idiots posting A/V 10 reviews are talking about. 
Necrofilo is right - This Movie Looks Like It Was VideoTaped Through A Dirty Condom! Don't Waste Your Time With It!
I have it on decent authority that http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5917308/The.Social.Network.2010.DvDScr.XviD.Feel-Free
is better 
I'm downloading right now - I'll repost with results"
,midurix,2010-12-10T17:40Z,"Video Taped Through A Dirty Condom? haha, that made me laugh!"
,ConTay,2010-12-12T06:04Z,Hey Guys didnt work for me it says i need coral player ? dont no what it is i go on the site and it says buy now for 99c but i dont wont to any help out there      THANKS
,ConTay,2010-12-12T06:08Z,"Hey again i have another problem its not playing the social network its playing harry potter 7 the last 1 just 2 minutes of it tho btw i havent finish downloading it, it is up to 31.2% "
,OneTwoWilliams,2010-12-13T13:44Z,"@AznAssassin 1GB isnt a big file, maybe 5 years ago it was but not today, you need to upgrade your Pentium4 256mb PC then stop bitching that 1GB is a big filesize

@Necrofilo what do you mean v/5-a/3, It's a fucking R5, if he said it was a dvd rip then maybe it is v/5-a/3, but he didnt say that, It's advertiased as an R5, and for an R5 this is v/8-a/6, fucking moron

@nofuckingusername that goes for you too fucking idiot

^ non of the 3 above have any uploads of their own what a fucking suprise"
,ConTay,2010-12-13T23:16Z,Man calm down OneTwoWilliams
,Melbournian,2010-12-14T13:58Z,Thanks for this.
,muhu88,2010-12-15T18:28Z,"I'll wait for FXG...

Thanks anyway"
,paraqui,2010-12-20T02:11Z,"At the end of the movie, when the credits of the film begin, there is no sound."
,wikifan,2010-12-25T10:51Z,"In VLC:
*Tools > Effects and Filters -- Enable; 2 Pass
*Tools > Track Synchronization > Advance of audio over video -- ""-0.300s""

Mediocre subtitles available here: http://subscene.com/english/The-Social-Network/subtitle-386786.aspx

After that the only problem is the missing audio during the credits, but still very watchable. However, try the BDRip by iMBT or the x264 BDRip from MKVGuy for much less hassle in a smaller filesize :)"
,Zinedin,2010-12-25T23:07Z,BAD SOUND QUALITY! It may be 127 Kb/s VBR MP3 but it's full of white noise. For that reason alone I'm gonna download some other release.
,lestatvvvvvv,2011-02-27T15:00Z,"Those who are bitching about the sound quality look at the price for it, you arent paying a penny for it . So for a slight hiss that is insane, if you want perfect goto the store an buy the dvd.
An Contay  never bother buying any of those players  or giveing any info to any company ,99.99999999% of the time those are scams or traps or virus or some other malware etc.."
