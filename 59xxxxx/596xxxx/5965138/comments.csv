,red_soil,2010-11-25T04:41Z,@ la_moskelah - How many days do you need? 3?
,la_moshkelah,2010-12-01T12:31Z,"@ red_soil atleast one year ok no problem i updated it and it showing an error ""Black list of licenses is corrupted"" what should i do for this thnx for reply"
,red_soil,2010-12-09T00:06Z,"@la - it gets blacklisted because its not the real key, many people use them. only way to get a 1 year key is to buy them. this is a small price we have to pay for using pirated keys. 

cheers"

I tried using  the registration entries but it's giving me an error. Could you just please give me the serial keys?"
,dario_980,2010-12-16T18:26Z,"Anyone know where to find license keys for KIS 7 to end of 2011 or maybe longer then 2012, it doesn't matter if they are blacklisted. "

,la_moshkelah,2011-01-13T04:47Z,"this keys are for me someday but now whenever I connect to internet  protection automatically disable by Kaspersky and showing the following message ""The licence agreement has been violated"" and ""You have exceeded maximum number of application copies that can be installed with one licence. Protection of your computer is disabled. You need to acquire new licence in order to resume your computer protection."" all this happening when I connect to internet otherwise everything is fine pls reply thanxxxxxxx"
,tideomega,2011-04-20T20:25Z,"I read all information and didn't find the answer to my question...which is.. All Anti-Virus programs need to be updated so, should I leave Kaspersky the set to get updates/access the internet ?

Thanks Guys"
