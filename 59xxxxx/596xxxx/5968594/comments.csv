,meytipeyti,2010-11-21T10:47Z,"Israel has a very legitimate right to EXIST  :) 
If palestinians want to return to their land , first all other nations that were ousted and tortured by SAVAGE ARABS during their invasion MUST return to their motherlands and their land be handed over to them."
,meytipeyti,2010-11-21T10:49Z,For example : All lands belonging to COPTIC Egyptians must be handed back to them and also all Zoroastrians ousted by SAVAGE ARABS to India and China must return to their homeland of Persia
,Ploni,2011-02-17T11:57Z,please dont compare those brutal expulsions to the Palestinians. First of all the Arabs waged war on the Jews not the other way around and second most of the so called palestinians are immigrants from Syria that arrived as late as 1946. The native Bedouin Arab population supports Israel and serves in the IDF
,robraw101,2011-12-06T09:42Z,I Love Israel.

You are an idiot. Israel has no right to exist. Those lands are home to the Sematic people (Semites), which the Israelis are not. Palestinians are Semites and are the rightful owners.

Israel is a country of Khazar Zionists, who promote terrorism and senseless violence."
