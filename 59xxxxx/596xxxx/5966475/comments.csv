,empressive,2011-01-26T15:56Z,"darn had to re register just to post this.

O.K  basically it's very easy to make a mistake setting this up.  I have an xp,  2x Vista and 1x win7
all set up using this torrent. they are all connecting fine with each other 2x laptops and 2x desktops,
I can watch my flicks anywhere :).

(Install setup closedown network magic)
Basically the main problem is those who are not running the patch from the correct folder. Make sure you copy the new patch  into the programfiles/purenetworks/networkmagic folder  BEFORE you run it, and like everyone says make sure all NM processes are shutdown. If you run the patch before you have it in the right place consider the whole installation fooked.  uninstall all, and delete your extracted folders. (otherwise patch will not reappear). Re-extract and install again.

it should be okay to start the trial version before you shut everything down and apply the patch. "

,Dondee49,2011-02-04T13:57Z,I downloaded both the trial pro version from Cisco and this version and checked the hashes for both.  Both versions have identical hashes so I would disregard the warning that disconnecting from the internet before installation will trigger a trojan. The patch does not trigger any trojan warning either.
,DevilNuts,2011-02-17T08:04Z,^^ And that's why you need to disconnect from the internet first.

,destrock,2011-04-05T07:02Z,"I just spent 2 hours to install that crap.

u need to install the prog (u can download the original latest version from the official site)

close the prog

putting the patch file in the directory and patch the .exe

open the prog

desabling your windows firewall (not just the real windows one, all your firewall) so the prog can use the trial version

it should work

but that prog sux so much... i deleted it after 30 sec. it cant connect to my router cause of my protection, even after disabling my encryption... maybe its easy with a base setting inside the router but i dont want tolose more time reseting everything.

enough is enough lol. there is nothing special inside that prog. ""testing my connection speed"" WOW..."
,hoopdedoo,2011-04-14T18:39Z,"I'm with Destrock on this one.  It's useless.  I still have it on my pc after installing it 2 days ago, because I haven't gotten around to uninstalling the shit, and I needed to know the mac address of one of my network pc's.  So, I figured I's use it to see the numbers, instead of having to walk all the way across the room.  Guess what...this pile of rubbish doesn't even do that.  It really doesn't have anything useful.

That said, I didn't precisely follow the directions given 10 posts above by user 100007 on2011-01-17.  I disconnected the internet after installing, but before cracking and running, and of course it didn't work.  I used Revo uninstaller on it, then installed again exactly by the steps, and it worked.  

Hey, do any of you know of a better network management program?  I'd love to have one that could do wake-on-lan, and also do an invisible terminal session (undetected by the remote user - yes, call me bad, but I have 3 teenage sons who I want to keep in omewhat control!).  Happy piratings."

,thinky_o,2011-04-30T11:11Z,"Alright, well my first post here, so first of Hey all.
Second, this torrent is 100% working, and ill explain steps i took to enable it.
I was same as you people, saying that its not working. But here is what you need to do.
First thing is IF you already have same version of Network Magic Installed, you need to uninstall it.
 Even tho its the same version, it doesnt compile with the patch, so uninstal it, reboot.

+After that, instal network magic from this torrent.

+After that close all processes that are working for Network Magic (there is 3! of them) one is hidden, and you need to ""View processes from all users, in task menager""

+Copy that patch to Network Magic Folder, and run it as admin.

Done.


So most important part is, i bet, the part where you need to uninstall your Network Magic that you got with your ruter CD or w/e! I bet thats where the hold up is, Second one is in closing procceses, i saw 3th process only when i enabled view processes from all users."
,khadill,2011-05-16T17:41Z,it works perfect but its tellin me to try an network magic pro for free :S ....

,frw11,2011-06-12T10:44Z,Perfect thanks
,hitler_X,2011-06-21T08:23Z,"I get the bottomline of this:

1. Install first the software. Make sure you go all the way until the set up to router is complete.

2, Make sure you have the trial expres 7 days.

3. Close the Application. Go to the Task Manager> Process> make sure you hit show process for all users tab below.

4. End the following process:
A. nmsrvc.exe, 
B. Pure Networks Platform Assistant (I forgot the .exe file but you can see it in Description name

and C. Go to services.msc and look for Pure Networks Platform Service, right click properties and disabled it. and apply.

5. Copy the patch on the Network Magic Folder, double click and patch.

The bottomline I saw here is that everytime I patched it before it configures everything, the trial period is not appearing, it says free version. Now it works after  3 and 5 tries.

Same will go as well with different torrents around with the same identical patch. Only good thing here is this is the newest version. Enjoy!"
,Murk1,2011-06-29T19:49Z,"Uh, yeah, I have the same incomplete patch window thing going on. I used this on win7 before, but had to re-up my sys, so I downloaded this version and I see it is the same patch as before, but no patch button shows. It doesn't run just from opening it, does it? cuz it's telling me to apply the patch. Can't apply with no apply button. Yes, all NM, Pure aps and srvs are off"
,Murk1,2011-07-01T21:03Z,"Well, this is a dumb one. I had a feeling the patch problem was on my end. I found the old patch on a backup drive, it is the same patch, stuck it in the folder, ran it, same window problem. Hmmm, Check your desktop appearance settings. If you have the screen set to ""easier to read"" and it is over the default 100%, windows is scaling up the fonts and images in all open windows. However, the patch has a set, inflexible pixel size. So try making your fonts smaller or the (control panel, appearance and personalization, display) display set to normal, log off and on to reset windows, then run the patch, viola! I can see and click the patch button, NetMag working fine.
thanks, hope this helps anyone.."

,gallant_687,2011-08-31T16:05Z,"little problem with d patch, after a lot of searching this method is 100% working 

1.) Click on nmsetup.exe
First It will extract files. Than you will see first wizard. You know, the usual thing (click next, ""Yes I agree to terms and conditions"", etc, etc). Click next, install the program.
2.) Than second wizard will appear. Cisco wizard. Go forward with set up, chose options, let it detect your router, let it SET UP your router (important!), let it finish installation.
3.) Than, exit program.
4.) Than bring Task Manager up (ctrl+shift+esc) and end processes ""nmapp.exe"", and anything else which have word ""pure"" or ""magic"" in it's description (eg. ""Network Magic Assistant"")
5.) Now (and no one bothered to mention this) go to start menu, right click on ""My Computer"", click on ""manage"". New window will appear, and last thing in left part of that window is ""Services and Application"". Click on that and chose ""Services"". Find service named ""Pure Networks Platform Service"" and stop it. You do that with right click, and than ""stop"".
6.) Copy the Patch in to your installation folder (usually ""C:\Program Files\Pure Networks\Network Magic\nmapp.exe"" - on Windows XP, or ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Pure Networks\Network Magic\nmapp.exe"" - on Windows Vista). Double click on that patch.
7.) Do the opposite of step number 5. Start ""Pure Networks Platform Service"" service.

Enjoy this great program."

,edwild54,2011-10-22T17:16Z,"I have not had any of the reported problems with installing on Win7 that others here have reported. I just installed it on Win 8 32 bit Developers version, and discovered 2 things that need to be done to make it install properly. I don't know which of them caused the problem, so I suggest you do both.

1. Turn Malwarebytes off if you have it installed. 
2. DO NOT install as administrator.

Other than that, I followed uploader's instructions exactly and it is working fine. Many thanks to DeGun!
