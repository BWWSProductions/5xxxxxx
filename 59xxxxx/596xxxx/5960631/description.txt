Rhapsody of Fire (formerly known as Thundercross and, previously, Rhapsody) is an Italian symphonic power metal band led by Luca Turilli and Alex Staropoli. Since forming in 1993, the band has released eight studio albums, one live album, two EPs, and a live DVD.

With these four members they started recording their debut album. In 1997 Rhapsody released their debut album, Legendary Tales. Co-founders Luca Turilli and Alex Staropoli created an epic sound with this first album. Rhapsody incorporated classical music, baroque and heavy metal styles in a sub-genre they call \"film score metal\" because of its resemblance to movie soundtracks. The classical influences include such composers as Vivaldi, Bach and Paganini. The band shows strong Power metal influences, and lyrical content is centered around high fantasy themes. The album was recorded in Germany by the well known producer Sascha Paeth (Heavens Gate) who also helped Rhapsody with the bass parts. The album was also the beginning story of the Emerald Sword Saga. Turilli is the band\'s lyricist, as well as its guitarist. His lyrics often refer to mystical folklore from the medieval age and the heroic valor of those times, highlighting in particular the everlasting fight between good and evil. \"Evil can be found everywhere,\" says Turilli. \"But it will never win as long as there are enough good people who fight against it.
