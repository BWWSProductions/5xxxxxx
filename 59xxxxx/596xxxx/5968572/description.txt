A lot of bad things have come "from the mind of M. Night Shyamalan," but we feel itâ€™s safe to say that this one came straight from his colon. What is there to say about The Last Airbender that isnâ€™t already said by its Rotten Tomatoes rating of 6%? A whole lot, as it turns out. Itâ€™s becoming apparent that the true genius of M. Night is finding a way to make the wrong creative decision at any given moment. Dialogue, casting, music cues, every choice in the film suggests that the once-acclaimed director has given up Alfred Hitchcock as his inspiration, and replaced him with a certain T. Wiseau. And, frankly, we couldnâ€™t be happier. But, Mr. Shyamalan: we worked with Tommy Wiseau, we know Tommy Wiseau, and you, sir, are no Tommy Wiseau.

Join Mike, Kevin, and Bill for The Last Airbender, the most disappointing adaptation of a beloved franchise since Mario Brothers 3: Luigi Buys Some Eggs.
