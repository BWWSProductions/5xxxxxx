,buttslaya117,2010-11-20T11:40Z,The aspect ratio is messed up. It's some widescreen format squished to 4:3.
,jericho_cane,2010-11-20T23:27Z,"If you have VLC player, you can easily correct the aspect ratio. Cheers! :) "
,buttslaya117,2010-11-21T01:58Z,"Oh, didn't know that. I usually use WMP, Media Player Classic, or my Xbox. The download was very fast btw."
,sam1418,2010-11-21T04:47Z,"Thanks for the up.  Terrible movie.

V=10 (after changing aspect ratio)
A=10 (the riffers' voices were at the right level)
M=0 (give up, Shyamalan)"
,ratPT01,2010-11-22T03:49Z,"Didnt know I could correct the aspect ratio before, thank you. But can anyone tell me if it can be saved that way so I dont have to do it everytime? I like to throw these videos on my ipod and would like the problem corrected."
,Halligan-1,2010-11-24T21:56Z,Can any 1 tell me how to get the rid of the voices on the film tht speak every time some1 on the films speaks very annoying
,shpongles,2010-11-25T12:37Z,"@Halligan-1

,Argetlam22,2010-11-27T10:54Z,"@ shpongles   LMFAO!!!! Omg, I can't believe how stupid that guy was...but I give you astronomical props for your line. I'm gonna lol myself to sleep tonight...yeah, if you guys are wondering what the extra voices are, gtfo. As for the rest, enjoy your Rifftrax. :)"
,rezor664,2010-12-10T20:07Z,Do people just not know the meaning of rifftrax?
,SilverishKitten,2010-12-20T19:17Z,"My friend got an infringement letter from his ISP from this torrent, so I suggest that people be very careful downloading this, as it may be tracked or something."
,jericho_cane,2010-12-20T20:04Z,Tell your friend to stop using Comcast. They're the only company that does that shit. 
,ackbarfan5556,2011-02-03T23:09Z,"what program would i need to accese a TPB torrent

,jericho_cane,2011-02-08T01:07Z,"WHAT? Someone dared to defile the sanctity of The Last Airbender? This is an abomination!! Something must be done! 

We appreciate your constant vigilance, Bent93.

,candycanegl,2011-02-28T21:39Z,"dear douchebag bent, you should learn to spell and/or use English grammar before making attempts at written communication. 

Also, you should google ""rifftrax"" and go get fucked."
,kilrbny,2011-08-05T19:07Z,"I love MST3k and was so heartbroken when it was ended but now a friend told me about rifftrax and I'm excited, to those of you who don't know, this video has audio over top of it, poking fun at the film, for those of us who think the movie deserves such treatment, if that's not your thing, fine, i won't insult your intelligence, as easy as that may be, but just know that this movie has other audio over it mocking it before you download it. there now i've told you twice if you dont read comments before you download, which you should, then its not our, or the uploaders fault "
,aParadox,2011-09-28T01:07Z,"Peerblock does nothing for protecting you from committing piracy.. It's a false sense of security.
I'm all for using it, but don't think it can keep you out of jail. Too many people get caught using PB2/other progs.
Love the rifftrax, it's the only way this movie was bearable! Thanks for the up!

Also, don't forget: DONATE TO RIFFTRAX PLEASE! I have three times already, too broke to keep going though."
,FuckSopa,2012-03-04T20:44Z,Very fast download thanks! I enjoy your other uploads as well.
