The four courses made by Michel Thomas himself originally (French, Spanish, German, and Italian). Zipped separately if you only want to download one. Transcript pdfs included.

Originally got all these from the JoeKane567's torrent "Michel Thomas Complete V2" (infinite blessings upon him).

So why download from this torrent instead? Because the files in this version are:

1) Organized! All the filenames and mp3 data tags (ie title, tracknumber, album, etc) are all regularized and set up so that you can simply put them on any device and they're sure to play in the right order.

2) Nice and compressed (each one takes up less than a CD, average 550ish mb). I don't hear any problems with sound quality.
