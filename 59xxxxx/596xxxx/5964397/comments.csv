,JSmotron,2010-11-18T07:32Z,This is the first time I've tried to upload a torrent. Please tell me if it's not working!
,JJStokes,2010-11-18T07:58Z,"What's going on here? You uploaded this torrent a week ago, it was never seeded and now you delete that one and upload a different version and it's still not seeded? "
,JSmotron,2010-11-18T08:44Z,"It said it was seeding in my client (ktorrent), but it never seemed to upload anything. I finally decided to try making a new one and make sure I got the tracker right. Still didn't work.

I just tried uploading from a different client on a different computer (bittorrent 7.1 on windows 7), and it's giving me an up speed, an ETA, and an uploaded count (~60 kB/s, ~15h, and currently ~50 MB, respectively).

Testing downloading it with yet another client (Transmission) on my other computer with ubuntu still fails, though...

Can you tell me if it's working for you now?"
,JSmotron,2010-11-18T09:06Z,"Okay, I think I got it working finally. Is it working for you?"
,JJStokes,2010-11-22T02:34Z,Yes it working now. Thanks for all you efforts it's much appreciated. BTW I helped seed it to a ratio of 3. Now on to study French
,daleel,2011-09-15T12:39Z,thank you very much for sharing your hard work! very kind of you mate.
