Documentary telling the story of the immigrant doctors who arrived in Wales in the 1950s and 60s from the Indian subcontinent and worked at the front line of the Welsh health service throughout one of the most turbulent periods in its history. These doctors not only changed the face of the NHS but also the culture of the communities they came to serve.

The programme reveals how these doctors came to Wales and, through their years of service, helped to change attitudes towards racism and immigration across Wales.
