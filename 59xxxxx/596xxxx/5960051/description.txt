Steve Winwood - While You See a Chance [promo].VOB 



HQ rare promo music video. "While You See a Chance" is a song performed by Steve Winwood in 1980, who also wrote it alongside Will Jennings. It was released on his album Arc of a Diver and peaked at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100, and also reached #68 on the Billboard Top 100 for the year 1981, however it only reached #45 in the UK. 

One of the song's most iconic features, its keyboard introduction, was not originally intended to be part of the song. The track was thrown together fairly quickly after Winwood discovered that he had accidentally deleted his intended drum track introduction while preparing for vocals. He wrote a new introduction on the spot as a replacement.
