  Apache: Air Assault features more than 16 multi-stage missions involving 
  air and ground strike operations off the coast of Africa, the mountains 
  of the Middle East and the jungles of Central America, each meticulously 
  created using high resolution map data from real-world satellite 
  photography. Apache helicopters are some of the most sophisticated 
  combat aircraft on the planet - the player gets to fly multiple variations 
  of them, each with their own extreme firepower and highly-detailed 
  damage modelling.
