,muthineni,2010-11-18T22:45Z,"just saw the sample.
greeeeaaaattt work on the encode.
i saw people discussing on whose rips to download...
well guys check the sample n see the difference.

one small suggestion keep going same way with ur new encodes. doesnt matter how many people do it. eventually people r gonna check the samples n get urs. but try to make it as early as u can.dont worry about ' already been done in mkv' thats plain silly suggestion. how much extra mb did the 5.1 add to ur encode"

,aksehra,2010-11-19T06:34Z,"oops sorry i didnt saw..
but waiting for Salt..."
,siddhart,2010-11-19T07:27Z,plz do inception 1080pbluray ... in hindi 5.1 ch audio.. also...wen it comes....
[V],prashant22,2010-11-19T07:37Z,"@siddhart
Sorry 1080p is nt possible...my pc is too slow to encode a 1080p.."
[V],prashant22,2010-11-19T09:10Z,"6ch audio is good only if u have 5.1 speakers...if u have 2.0 or 2.1 speakers then i think it would nt make a difference...i dont know much as i hv only 2.1 speakers...

if anyone has 5.1 speaker set plz care to explain..i think himansu hv it..."
,DSIN,2010-11-19T09:12Z,"5.1 is basically 6 channel surround sound... won't be of any help if u hav stereo (2 speakers)...
google for more info ;)
@siddhart : 1080p i understand...but y hindi dub ?
 that rip would be a waste... (any foreign movie in hindi dub is a waste) ???"
,aksehra,2010-11-19T10:04Z,"ya absolutely correct
its better to watch it in english...
movies like Inception,The Dark knight and many hits are bettr to watch in English only rather than in Hindi... "
,himansu_007,2010-11-19T12:19Z,"Agreed with prashant N dsin about 5.1 ch sound 

but
now a days hindi dubbed movies are also releasing in india keeping the original studio sound 
they only change the voice recorded track 2 hindi so in digital cinema theaters u won't miss any thing in hindi sound also
bye the way i prefer 2 watch movies in eng 2 hear original voice of actors.."
,himansu_007,2010-11-19T12:31Z,If possible do salt also in 5.1 the movie worth it
[V],prashant22,2010-11-19T12:36Z,"@all
Does anyone have a ps3...I hv been using seeting compatible with ps3...bt I don't hv one to check if my rips work on that or nt...so if anyone hv a ps3 plz let me know.."
[V],prashant22,2010-11-19T12:53Z,ya salt will be in 5.1..
,DSIN,2010-11-19T13:00Z,"@himansu :yeah i hate that the most... goin to theater to watch ur fav movie & it turns out they dubbed it.. dialogues r one of the most important part of a movie.. :(
@mzk : i have dark knight in 1080p.. like all my fav movies :D 
its one of the best movies alright.. but certainly not THE BEST... don't need a link cuz i'll never watch it in hindi anyways... ledger was superb in it.. :D"
,DSIN,2010-11-19T15:20Z,"@ u have books on movies.... ..LOL
kidding.. :D
yup everyone has their own opinion.. i was talking in general.. ;)"
[V],prashant22,2010-11-19T16:41Z,"@sylar
Welcome..where hv u been these days.."
,jamydoug,2010-11-19T18:28Z,"@prashant22: dude i've a doubt in encoding quality
which looks better in quality of these two??
Blu ray : 1080p source ripped into 3.33 gb with Video Codec name: AVC MPEG-4
Avg. Bitrate: 2695 Kbps
Encoding: 2 Pass
Resolution: 1280 x 528

or

a video ripped from a 720p source with 6.6 gb size and having 1280x536 @ 4821 Kbps
and audio at DTS 1509 Kbps
which of the above two looks good in quality???
"
,DSIN,2010-11-19T21:11Z,"@mzk : i can easily giv it 9/10 anyday... a masterpiece really.. but its meant for brainy viewers & is in the same league with memento, se7en, etc...where directors don't feed movies to viewers but actually let audience to grasp wat they can on their own... 
& iam pretty sure u don't know wat happened in the end ... :D"
,muthineni,2010-11-20T04:33Z,"@mzk , dsin
i like this movie too but i have to accept imdb got it slightly overrated. but everyone try to see 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5899547/South_Park_S14E10_Insheeption_HDTV_XviD-FQM_[eztv]

its a south park rip on the movie. ull definitely like if not love it.u can watch it online too.dont miss it :)"
[V],prashant22,2010-11-20T05:27Z,"@mzk welcome...

guys out of the top 250 of imdb there are abt 80% movie which u'll find nt that good to be top rated...
bt this one surely deserves to be...this movie is nt like dark knight which u can watch with excitement and cool mind...
this one needs full concentration because if u miss something then everything is missed
like DSIN said ""its meant for brainy viewers""..
so my vote is also 9/10..-1 only because u hv to watch with full attention..

btw DSIN if u hv completed the download how did it looked on ur 32""???"
,DSIN,2010-11-20T08:43Z,"@prashant : yeah dloaded ur inception... plays gr8 on my pc monitor ... haven't tried on bravia yet... i'll try it tonight..so i'll tell u then ;)
btw
u got it right but it all depends on the person watching... mzk didn't like inception... I hated titanic, avatar, batman begins etc... but its my opinion & it doesn't change that those movies r good-gr8 for general viewers...same with inception.. some ppl may not like it... but its still #4 on imdb list..
& i like brainy movies... if i hav to pick one bale movie..i'll pick prestige over dark knight anyday :D"
[V],prashant22,2010-11-20T09:17Z,"ya i loved darknight more for joker...
although i like bale too he has done some good movies..movies like batman ofcourse. 310 to yuma and 2-3 more..


@jamy
sorry dude for the late reply i just didnt noticed ur comment...
i hv no answer to that question because if i will watch both of them on my 21"" then there will be no difference...for such high bitrates comparision can only be done on bigger sized screens which i dont have...
althought if i say keeping in mind the basics the one with high bitrate will hv more quality.."
,muthineni,2010-11-20T09:59Z,"i liked this movie..not the best.. but look at what south park had to say..
woman: just because an idea is convoluted and complex doesnt make it cool. going to multiple dream levels sounds like a really stupid idea.
leo di caprio : you just dont get it coz ur not smart enough.
lol
interesting argument eh?"
[V],prashant22,2010-11-20T10:34Z,ha ha..ya totally
[V],prashant22,2010-11-20T15:19Z,"CHill out dude...like dsin said everyone have their own taste...
If u didn't liked it u can give less rating points at imdb..may be that will affect its rating a lil bit..
ALso IMDb ratings are nt exactly true they r given by users like us and nt all users give their ratings like me like u..."
,DSIN,2010-11-20T16:02Z,"
i'd like to have the last word here... 
@ mzk :prashant is right...imdb is not exactly true & like i said it all goes down to personal opinions... u don't like inception, makes no difference..its still one of the best.. cuz imdb is pure democracy.... & i might take offence if u go on abt inception ... & u would not like me ranting abt how bad a movie predator was :D 
here is a quote u'll find interesting... (i took it from 20-40) ..

,anarchore,2010-11-21T02:21Z,Fucking mp4!
[V],prashant22,2010-11-21T08:01Z,"@anarchore
fuck u...still living in the old age..."
,muthineni,2010-11-21T09:34Z,"@anarchore
play ur avi in windows media player and watch it with ur eyes closed. dumb avi 
mkv mp4 r the best file formats for encoding. proof- check for urself"
,Blackbird_CaD_,2010-11-21T10:31Z,"Is this a joke? The title says 720p, but the video resolution is 1280x536, so this movie IS NOT 720p, 720p is 1280x720"
[V],prashant22,2010-11-21T10:58Z,"@Blackbird_CaD
actually ur knowledge abt 720p is a joke...get some knowledge first dont post nonsence comments..."
,DSIN,2010-11-21T13:28Z,"i can explain this aspect ratio thing... as i wondered that in the start too.. 
actually 720p = 1280 x 720 = 16:9 aspect ratio.
but now movies r not released in this ratio... inception's original ratio is 2.35:1 ... which should be 1280 x 544.. 
so this shld be called 536p but since it is ripped from a 720p bluray it is rightly called 720p...

p.s : i may be wrong  :D"
[V],prashant22,2010-11-21T14:10Z,"@DSIN
ya u r right...
bt the bluray is actually 1280x720 bt with black bars so the sources from which people like us download remove the black bars so the resolution becomes 1280x544...it helps pack more bitrate to the actual thing(movie)...
"
,himansu_007,2010-11-21T14:30Z,"Ya and it may be helpful 2 save some space like 20-50MB
: )"
[V],prashant22,2010-11-21T14:34Z,"@himansu
ya if ur encoding a 1280x544 and size is 700mb so to get same quality the size may increse by 30% for 1280x720..."
,Venadan,2010-11-30T07:48Z,can you upload Chinatown 1974
