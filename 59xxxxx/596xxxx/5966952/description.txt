"College"

Jack (Baldwin) worries that GE's microwave 
sales have improved too much without his 
help and tries to find glitches in their 
newest design. Meanwhile, Liz (Tina Fey) 
partakes in a crew lottery despite Jenna 
(Jane Krakowski) and Tracy's (Tracy 
Morgan) warning her not to do so. 
Elsewhere, the TGS writers discover that 
Jack is the voice of an online 
dictionary's pronunciation guide.

Back to a real encode and not some 1clicked 
trash this week. 

Enjoy :)
