Ghost Hunters Season 6 (mostly) Complete with Live at Alcatraz and Halloween Live Special.

Updated Note:  Two additional episodes aired in December (TAPS Meets the Real Housewives of Atlanta and Ghost of Christmas Past), so technically this is not "complete".  My apologies.  I was going off the schedule from epguides and tvrage and these upcoming episodes were NOT listed at the time Sloss Furnace was available.
