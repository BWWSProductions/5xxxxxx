,ponku,2010-11-21T00:06Z,There are still 3 episodes left.
[T],trialNerror,2010-11-21T06:21Z,"There's actually only two: TAPS Meets the Real Housewives of Atlanta and then Ghosts of Christmas Past.  
They were not listed on epguides or tvrage last week, though. Oh well.
These are upcoming ""specials"" and you can get them from me or someone else in December."
,ponku,2010-11-21T06:54Z,"There's also Spirits of San Francisco which airs on December 29th.

Thanks for your work here!"
[T],trialNerror,2010-11-21T15:20Z,"Dang.  ponku is right.  Oddly the San Fransisco episode still isn't listed on tvguide, tvrage, or epguides, but IS listed on syfy.com/ghosthunters.

Will have these three extra eps on here in due time.

Thanks for your patience.

[T],trialNerror,2010-12-12T01:50Z,"There were only 2 additional episodes.  

Taps Meets the Housewives of Atlanta and Ghost of Christmas Past were the final episodes of season 6.

Spirits of San Francisco is actually a rerun from season 3.
