religious and narrow minded population at the island expects her to behave. The arrival of a
group of Georgian soldiers brings color, life en love in Marie's life at the colorless Nordsea
island. With their music and film, but especially with their inventive and unusual surviving
strategies and their radically different vision on life, this isolated group foreigners help
Marie to find herself. For the first time in her life, Marie falls in love. Unfortunately,
her love for soldier Goga from Kazbek and the friendship with the other soldiers, is not
accepted by her family and the other people on the island. Exhorted by the female hero in the
