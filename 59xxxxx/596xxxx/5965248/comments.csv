,murrambingi,2010-12-12T07:17Z,"this contains a backdoor trojan and a .bat file as a part of the crack which are untrustworthy i am reporting this torrent to the admins for investigation.
To all others if you are going to use this program for personal use only, then it is 100% free from here: http://www.teamviewer.com/index.aspx"
,ChayDX,2011-01-14T23:24Z,the actual teamviewer has a trojan and the crack is not a crack i sandboxed the bat file and it opens up some site that is very sketch and flags my shit bad. DO NOT DOWNLOAD
,crazytopp,2011-01-17T08:37Z,cooll
,Bengle,2011-01-24T12:29Z,"Shut the fuck up murrambingi. Teamviewer is NOT 100% free, you only get test sessions if you download it from their website. That's why we're all here in the first place."

,memizex1,2011-02-24T18:44Z,Crack Downgrades. Also doesn't seem to respond right. Not worth the try.
,GoWithTheFlowYo,2011-03-06T15:52Z,"Crack downgrades to v5. Batch file opens website calles ""alldownloads.com"" not really a ""vip"" upload if you ask me"
,21309,2011-03-08T03:25Z,You are definantly the man Thumper.
,Brit-T.V,2011-03-22T13:55Z,"This is not 6, the whole reason i am looking for this is to customize my quick support but if the versions dont match its pointless!"

,aixxx,2011-05-07T13:58Z,"It is a fake trojan contained not cracked v5 version of teamviewer.
Teamviewer free for private use, it means you can not use it for server versions of Windows."
