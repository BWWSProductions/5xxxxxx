U Turn (1997)

Director: Oliver Stone

U Turn is a 1997 crime film directed by Oliver Stone, based on the book Stray Dogs by John Ridley. It stars Sean Penn, Billy Bob Thornton, Jennifer Lopez, Jon Voight, Powers Boothe, Joaquin Phoenix, Claire Danes and Nick Nolte.

U Turn was filmed in 1996 on location in Superior, Arizona and other areas of Arizona and California.

Oliver Stone is best known for his long winded conspiracy films JFK, Nixon but his remarkable back catalogue contains others gems such as Wall Street, The Doors and Platoon. With U Turn, Stone delves into the dark world of noir with interesting results.

Bobby Cooper ,Sean Penn, is heading for Vegas to pay off a gambling debt when his car breaks down in the small town of Superior. After leaving his car with the local mechanic, he meets up with the sultry Grace ,Jennifer Lopez, and her husband Jake ,Nick Nolte. Things start to go a little crazy when Jake suggests Bobby murders Grace for a share of the insurance money. Bobby refuses, but then he loses the cash he needs to pay off his debts in a robbery. As events spiral out of control, Bobby meets ever more eccentric characters. All he really wants to do is leave town alive.

U Turn neatly takes the familiar noir narrative and relocates it squarely in Oliver Stone visuals country. More than a little reminiscent of John Dahl's Red Rock West ,another good example of nineties noir, the film plays like a glorious pantomime with a host of famous faces tackling the various parts with gusto. What makes U Turn special is its humor. It's as if Stone got tired of the serious, mystical stuff and instead came up with a deliriously, deliciously, overblown farce. Mind you, there's still an out of place philosophiser at Superior in the form of Jon Voight's blind man but here it just adds to the surreal nature of the plot.

Resembling the mutant offspring of Natural Born Killers mated with Doc Hollywood, U Turn is that rarest of beasts, a genuinely enjoyable film.

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
