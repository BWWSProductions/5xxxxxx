Kind of a random torrent. Actually, it's just a convenient way for me to send 10gb of data to a friend, but maybe there's more demand for it..
Basically the videos from here: http://www.lordkat.com/dungeons-dragons - saved as flv, so you can watch them in a normal player instead of the browser.

These are online D&D Sessions with Spoony form spoonyexperiment.com as DM and other TGWTG-guys as players. If you don't know who i'm talkin about here... tough luck.

Also in case someone wonders: I emailed LordKat before creating this torrent and he allowed it.

[edit] I don't know why seeder is still on 0, but i'm seeding at a steady (if somewhat slow) pace.
Also, one video (between 19 and 20) is missing, you can find that one here:
