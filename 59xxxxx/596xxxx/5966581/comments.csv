,Plato202,2011-08-15T05:27Z,"Throwing in my personal Kudos to vtwin88cube for the upload, thanks bro!
@ imapiratetoo: I don't know who Jack Green is, but I personally think you're very likely an idiot. We all have our own musical tastes & opinions, but throwing out the name of one song from some dude no one has heard of and saying it's ""better than"" DECADES of hits from one of the world's greatest rock bands is blatant silliness."

,hooligan667,2011-09-06T01:18Z,Rock n' Roll!  CHEERS!!!
,Caldrumr,2011-09-07T08:35Z,"Thanks you for this, and all of your other great torrents.  It is wonderful to see perfect, high-quality versions of the greatest music of all time all in one place.
This may be a long shot (and off topic), but you wouldn't happen to have a link to a torrent for Al Jarreau Sings Bill Withers, would you?  I can't seem to find it anywhere.  
Thanks again!"
[V],vtwin88cube,2011-09-08T23:08Z,"You're welcome guys & Caldrumr....I just put up Al Jarreau - Ain't No Sunshine for you.Hopefully this does the trick....

,HiroPro2,2011-10-10T07:12Z,"Mp3 101 !!!

(1) Encode using LAME (itunes is CRAP using Fraunhofer encoder boo!!)

(2) Set encoder to VBR (variable bit rate) as LAME was engineered for this. CBR is CRAP and in all honesty a VBR altpreset standard at -V2 is as good as a 320 CBR !!!! and file is WAY SMALLER!!!

(3) SET IT TO JOINT STEREO NOT ""STEREO"" and if I have to explain don't ask because you have no comprehension of what the setting actually does or the maths/technology behind mp3!!!

owhh and LEARN how to use GOOGLE and RESEARCH ripping music PROPERLY you 320 CBR Fraunhofer RETARDS!!!

PS dBpoweramp is FANTASTIC ripping software!"
