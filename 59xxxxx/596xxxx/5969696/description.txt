* Working Hell/Nether Teleportation in Multiplayer!
* Improved Multi Player chat system. Scroll through the last 300 messages. Ctrl+C to copy and Ctr+V to paste. All chat is logged to chatlog.txt
* Couple of other small fixes that I may have forgotten

please seed, as we need more right now
enjoy

General fixes:
* players and mobs in lava or fire no longer spam sound effects
* getting hit with a higher damage while recovering from a smaller one now works as intended
* lava flows further in the Nether
* zombie pigs eventually forgives
* added support for custom skin packs
* fixed duplicate buttons when resizing screens
* zombie pigs and ghasts no longer get hurt by fire or lava
* fixed volume sliders now saving properly

Multiplayer fixes:
* hellworld=true no longer overwrites old save chunks. Player positions will still break if you switch it on a running server, though
* boats are now visible to other players
* minecarts move nicer
* fishing kinda sorta works, but needs more work
* sheep and cows look like sheep and cows now
* buckets work now
* fixed stairs being really difficult to destroy
* increased the timeout before Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¼Ã´Took too long to log inÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¬Â¥
* made it possible to ride carts and boats
* added (after lots of work) the ability to steer server-side boats
* added Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¼Ã´no-animalsÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¬Â¥ setting. if true, animals will immediately vanish
* added support for more animation settings. Currently itÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s just the Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¼Ã´ridingÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¬Â¥ animation, but the same system will be used for sneaking


Upgrading?

*As this is a massive update. I highly recommend DELETING your old 
.minecraft folder before installing this one, you may exclude your "saves" folder
if you want to preserve your old SP maps*
UNPACK your RAR into your old .minecraft folder. 
Run Launch.bat files (Requires 1GB ram). Tada!


=======================================================

How to use HD texture packs?

Go into folder ".minecraft/Install HD Texture Packs"
Pick any .bat file... run it. and it new textures will be loaded the 
next time you launch MineCraft.


=======================================================

Quick Instructions:

UNPACK your RAR into %appdata% folder.
Make Sure you change "Your User Name" with your actual username

Windows 7: 
C:\Users\Your User Name\Appdata\Roaming\.minecraft

Windows Vista: 
C:\Users\Your User Name\Appdata\Roaming\.minecraft

Windows XP: 
C:\Documents and Settings\Your User Name\Local Settings\Application Data\.minecraft


That's ALL now Run "Launch.bat" or "Launch_x64.bat" to play!
If you have Win7 and 64bit Java with 4GB or more RAM you can run "Launch_x64_4GB.bat" (5GB or more required)


Works well ONLINE on ALL FREE & LEGIT Servers.
