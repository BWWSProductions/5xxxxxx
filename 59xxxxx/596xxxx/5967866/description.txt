Featuring Bill's trademark musical interludes, 
observations and stories of the road, Dandelion Mind 
will be based loosely on the theme of doubt (or will it?), 
as we follow Bill from his real-life saga of being trapped 
by the ash cloud, to his barely contained rants about
TV, creationism and Michael Winner. 

He demonstrates new instruments, both ancient and modern, he sings 
an internet love song, a lament about punk heroes, Iranian hip-hop, 
and plays a mean folk-bouzouki. Thomas the Doubter gets a new look, 
and Darwin's curious obsessions and the myth of intelligent design 
are all worked over in Bailey's own surreal style.

He revisits the music of his youth, with a brand-new French Disco 
re-working of Gary Numan's hit, Cars, played in his own inimitable 
way, and maybe some Wurzel-based remixes of classic German techno. 
Just your normal Bill Bailey gig, then.
