In a flashback sequence following the first Saw film, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) crawls from the bathroom to find help after sawing off his foot. Along the way, he reaches a steam pipe and uses it to cauterize his ankle stump. The next scene cuts to a crowd of people gathering around a storefront window in an urban shopping area where they watch two men, Ryan (Jon Cor) and Brad (Sebastian Pigott), tied to a worktable. There is a buzz saw in front of each man, and their mutual lover, Dina (Anne Lee Greene), is suspended above a third saw. They are told that they can either attempt to kill one another or allow Dina to die, and after realizing her betrayal, they decide to save themselves and allow her to lower onto the saw, killing her.
