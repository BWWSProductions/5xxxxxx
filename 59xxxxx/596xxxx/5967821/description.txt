Third Strike is the "prince of grime" Tinchy Stryder's third studio album and explores the impact success has had on his life since the days of growing up in Bow, East London. The album includes a mix of harder street tracks such as "Gangsta?", coupled with the kind of catchy, radio friendly singles like "In My System" and "Second Chance" that have become Tinchyâ€™s signature. Production comes courtesy of Fraser T Smith and Nathan Retro and Third Strike features guest artists such as Melanie Fiona on "Let it Rain", Bluey Robinson on "Tomorrow" and "Game Over" featuring Tinie Tempah.
