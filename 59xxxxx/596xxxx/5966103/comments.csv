My first experience with torrent was MAC Lightside.  YOWZA!  I was overwhelmed.  Yet, in following your notes (and torrent training by a friend) I was successfull.

*  Your organization structure of files is superb.  
*  Your attention to detail to include everything needed, etc. is impressive.  
* The information you provide in your associated notes is comprehensive, the presentation organized and easy to follow.  
* Your work is OUTSTANDING!!!!!
---  COMPLETE, RELIABLE AND TRUSTWORTHY.
VERY VERY THOROUGH

Thank you for loading apps for MAC. "
,silaskreek,2011-03-23T17:30Z,"Thanks so much for this torrent. I couldn't find MasterWriter anywhere. My only problem now is the download seems to be stuck :P But I guess I'll have to be patient.

I'll try to remember to come back and post on how the install went for anyone considering downloading this (I'm only downloading MasterWriter, so I won't be able to comment about the rest of the stuff in the torrent.)

Thanks again."

Or anyone. Did you ever get MasterWriter to work?"
