,BoZo0,2010-12-12T16:50Z,French subs please ?
[V],room101bellboy,2010-12-14T21:21Z,"@BoZo0: 
I normally include French subs but it's almost impossible for this one. There were no French subs in the blu-ray source and the French subs available on the Internet (@ opensubtitles.org and other sites) are for the rated version (113 minutes) while my encode is the unrated version (115 minutes).  

Synchronizing the subs is possible but requires hours of work (comparing both movies cuts, identifying the missing scene, and then using an application like Subtitles Workshop). I know how to do it but it's just too much work. Sorry.

,BipolarMonkey,2011-01-01T23:11Z,Might be a stupid question but how do I attach or use the subtitles? Should WMP automatically pick them up or is there something I need to do? I have never downloaded a foreign movie that didn't have the subtitles automatically come up.

in vlc player? or do i have to find the folder?"
