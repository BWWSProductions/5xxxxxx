STORY
Paul is a U.S. contractor working in Iraq. After an attack by a group of Iraqis he wakes to find he is buried alive inside a coffin. With only a lighter and a cell phone it's a race against time to escape this claustrophobic death trap.

IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:Russian DVD9 .................. Thanks
AUDIO:OWN CAM

Here we have a r5 of buried... but sorry only cam audio. Right the video was pretty good but was such a dark film, we needed to add some more brightness but we never messed too much with it... just a +2. Also the colours were slightly off so we changed them and also used a white balance command in our script aswell. The audio now this wasn't that good at all... too loud so it distored, lots of noise and the balance of bass, mid, treble was all over the place... so we dropped it in adobe audition and used a hiss and noise removal filters and also totaly changed the EQ.

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
