*Release Notes: This is the first of two episodes aired on 2010-11-16. I have no idea what CRiMSON is thinking with
the episode numbering. They show that last week's episodes are #07 & #08 which cannot be correct. This show has been
airing for six weeks including this week. There are two new epsiodes every Tuesday. 6x2=12 which means this week is
episodes #11 & #12. I'm sure as hell not going to check all of CRiMSON's releases to see which are labeled 
incorrectly, but I suggest that they do.
