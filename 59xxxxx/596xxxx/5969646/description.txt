Thanks to oggelbe for the original file. His is still listed on here, but doesn't seem to be getting seeded very well.

I have shrunk the file from 1.3 gb to a little over 300 mb with very little (if any) loss in quality.

However, if you are unimpressed with the quality of my compression, or would prefer to download oggelbe's copy it is located here:


Thanks and enjoy

Description from oggelbe's page:

A graphic novel recounting the spiritual odyssey of philosopher Bertrand Russell. In his agonized search for absolute truth, Russell crosses paths with legendary thinkers like Gottlob Frege, David Hilbert, and Kurt GÃ¶del, and finds a passionate student in the great Ludwig Wittgenstein. But his most ambitious goal--to establish unshakable logical foundations of mathematics--continues to loom before him. Through love and hate, peace and war, Russell persists in the dogged mission that threatens to claim both his career and his personal happiness, finally driving him to the brink of insanity.
