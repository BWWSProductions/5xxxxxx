The 7.1 is amazing."
,LigGeorge,2010-11-17T15:28Z,I can upload an m4a audio file and it will be more compatible .
,LigGeorge,2010-11-17T15:30Z,I can upload an m4a audio file and it will be more compatible.

,LigGeorge,2010-11-19T14:31Z,"This format is mkv with 7.1 sound.I don't know if your tv is compatible with ths.Soon I will upload an m4a and insructions to change the audio stream.Anyway,since it's 3d(50%anamorfic)you can remux it.Note that you must set your tv to activate the 3D."
,LigGeorge,2010-11-20T00:27Z,"New m4a audio stream:

,LigGeorge,2010-11-21T14:26Z,"There is only one program that can perform this,you can find it.But you need a stong pc."
,mferguson,2010-11-26T12:14Z,"Wow, followed the instructions for the m4a audio stream, copied the new file to usb drive and connected directly to Samsung PS58C7000 which played the mkv flawlessly.  Thank you soooooo much."
,patelhe,2010-12-01T19:44Z,Have inserted the m4a audio with MKVMerge as instructed but the new file will not play video...only audio
,LigGeorge,2010-12-02T05:50Z, What program /device did you use to play the file?
,CDLX5342,2010-12-12T00:35Z,"Great torrent! original audio file wasn't much good for most devices but if you follow the link and remux with the MP4 file, it works great! Cheers LigGeorge. Love your work"
,TheGriffinman,2010-12-15T05:05Z,"Video is near flawless on my Samsung 3D TV (playing through wireless network), but no audio.  I'm going to follow your M4A link and see if I can work it out, but my Samsung is feeding a 7.1 channel Onkyo, so I'm not sure why that wouldn't work.

Who would buy a 3D TV without 3D audio?"
,TheGriffinman,2010-12-15T05:14Z,"The 3D is awesome on my Samsung (wireless networked)!!!  Started out as split screen, asked me how to adjust it and then told me how to adjust it.  Put the active shutter glasses on, and bang, looked great.

Too bad about the sound though, my Samsung is feeding a 7.1 Onkyo receiver, because I figured why have 3D TV without 3D sound, right?  Well, I have top of the line, THX Certified equipment, and I can't push audio from your file.  So I'm interested in what you're using(?)

I'm going to follow your M4A link now.  Thanks.  I don't really care about this movie, just like the concept that we can share 3D movies, and your video came through without a hitch!"
,Dodgey17,2010-12-16T13:49Z,"can u please help, i downloaded mp4 audio stream and used mkvmerge as advised, worked fine. then converted for ps3 with badaboom as advised which also worked fine however audio is only stereo , no surround sound? any sugggestions on where i went wrong and how i can get surround sound??"
,Dodgey17,2010-12-16T13:52Z,"i downloaded file and then mp4 audio stream as advised used mkvmerge as advised, used badaboom to convert for ps3, this all worked fine and i have a 10/10 video file with stereo audio, no surround sound, any suggestions on where i went wrong and how i can get surround sound with the video???"
,LigGeorge,2010-12-16T14:57Z,"Maybe you downgraded it during the conversion.Unfortunatly badaboom doesn't offer many settings.To avoid a second conversion ,you can do a trick: 
download ""yamb"".It does the work of mkvmerge for mp4 files.So you can use it to combine easy and fast my multichannel audio stream and your mp4 video file."
,megarfield14,2010-12-19T06:49Z,"Thanks so much for uploading this, i have all your 3d movies and they are all great quatlity. Can i request a 3d movie please if you can upload ""Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of GaHoole (2010)"" i would greatly appreciate it. thank you"

,Mikee2185,2010-12-23T21:33Z,"100% quality, 3d works great - played using nvidia stereo player, after remuxing with another audio stream, original did not work."
,susheng,2011-01-01T13:06Z,Thank you so much followed the instructions and re muxed as sound and vidio were not synced but worked beautifully and is breathtaking on my Samsung 3d system again thank you for all your hard and outstanding quality work
,j1zzle,2011-01-03T05:43Z,Is it just me or does the left frame twitch every 10-15 seconds. The right frame is perfectly fine... but the left one twitches. It's noticeable when you have the video playing side by side and in actual 3d mode as well. I downloaded your Avatar torrent and it did not have this problem. Anyone else notice the twitching on the left frame? Kind of annoying.
,johnnymrk2000,2011-01-05T14:45Z,"please help!!!!

please help"
,LigGeorge,2011-01-05T19:42Z,"Yamb is for mp4 files.If you read CAREFULLY the post I say to use yamb for an mp4 ,the user Dodgey17 has created.
Furthermore if you read the instructions even MORE CAREFULLY you will find the solution for your problem.
The instructions write to use ""MKV MERGE""."
,johnnymrk2000,2011-01-05T20:54Z,"ok, when i add the two files in mkv merge , where it  says tracks -there is no chapter line to select , it is only  a truehd , avmpeg4 iso video and the m4a audio stream 

what to do ,
shall i ignore the chapter line that is missing and unselect the hd audio and press start muxing?

please reply"

,LigGeorge,2011-01-06T21:58Z,Unselect only the dolby digital audio.
,worcester,2011-01-08T17:40Z,"I too have the slight twitch on the left hand frame. I think I have lessened the effect by turning off 24Hz on my TV. Still think there is a glitch, but less noticable."
,johnnymrk2000,2011-01-08T20:47Z,"i tried , it does not work, it seems like is loading the film and then it freezes and nothing happens

i loaded the normal blu ray -and the video works with no sound coming out, and after muxing with the 5.1 audio and ofcourse unselecting the 7.1  it is all of the above -it just freezes on black screen"
,abyjohns,2011-01-09T07:43Z,"hi friend....i have samsung 7000 led 3d tv..is this video play in my tv ,with 3d..?"
,johnnymrk2000,2011-01-09T10:31Z,"george, please, can you upload another 5.1 audio file (m4a)!

i can not handle with the 226.25 mb m4a file.

cheers"
,darkaragon,2011-01-11T00:09Z,"LigGeorge, would it be possible to tell us how you got the file to be side by side?? I've got loads of dvs here ( yes originals) and would like to have them in 3D."
,darkaragon,2011-01-11T00:10Z,btw.. thank you for all the 3D uploads
,LigGeorge,2011-01-11T15:19Z,"The original source is a bluray 3D.
Dvd's don't  cortain 3d material and anaglyph doesn't count.I don't know a way to transform 2d to 3d.It is possible though.Disney for example is going to convert some old movies in 3d .Also we will see starwars episode 1 in 3d sometime in 2014."
,Shadowgatez,2011-01-11T16:05Z,"you may want to try cyberlink powerdvd ultra, it says it can convert ur dvds to 3d in real time. However, you'll need a computer that has a graphics card that is compatible with hdmi 1.4 and u might need a hdmi 1.4 cable to hook it up the tv, as for conversion as in video conversion, theres currently none that does 3d conversion atm... not that i know of anyway"
,Shadowgatez,2011-01-11T16:05Z,oh and thx LigGeorge for the uploads xD
,chopped,2011-01-21T22:30Z,3dfier will convert 2d to 3d (google 3dfier). It works best with 720p and above videos.  It supports NVIDIAs 3d vision and the new 3d TVs.  I have purchased it myself and it works really well.
,DJMpyrat,2011-01-31T02:01Z,"Thanks for the upload,Great job, How can I get this to convert to a DVD???ConvertXto gives No stream error"
,LigGeorge,2011-02-05T00:16Z,"Why do you want to convert it to dvd?
If you reduce the resolution and bitrate you will lose the 3d effect.It will look terrible."
,Gogul69,2011-02-05T02:46Z,"Any chance you can re code this? The left screen does judder and gives me a queasy feeling and there's a lot of ghosting from unsynced pictures. Kudos to the despicable me upload it was perfect! Really want a good copy of this though until they release the bluray officially.
Thanks for your hard work so far lig you are a legend!"
,DJMpyrat,2011-02-05T02:58Z,"Well so far I got avatar reload to convert on to dvd and it look pretty good, also decspecable me worked well Why I did this is I don't have a large gig flash stick,best I could figure I'd need a 32gig flash drive to fit a couple 3d's on, even a 16gig is $30.00. these 3d things take a lot of harddrive space so I can't see leaving them loaded on my pc So there you have it,.,.I ordered a 500gig external and plan to store 3d movies on it  I hope to use a usb port on 3dtv to play off that do you think that would work"
,Gogul69,2011-02-07T13:10Z,I purchased a 320 gig external portable hdd for ÂŁ2.99 more than a 32gb flash stick would cost. Absolutely brilliant bargain I use it to transfer the films to my lacie hd media player. Works a treat! 
,Gogul69,2011-02-12T14:49Z,Ok LiG has said that for those complaining about the left screen twitch he/she has re-encoded it and is waiting to upload it soon. Problems should rectified asap. 
,yarddawg,2011-02-25T07:02Z,"I downloaded the MP4 audio torrent and have the file, but the instructions are blank. Anyway to get those?"
