Carl Terrell Mitchell (born November 27, 1973), better known by his stage name Twista, is an American rapper. Mitchell debuted as Tung Twista in 1992 with Runnin' Off at da Mouth and dropped "Tung" from his stage name in 1996. He once held the title of fastest rapper in the world: according to the Guinness World Records in 1992, being able to pronounce 11.2 syllables per second. In 1997, after appearing on Do or Die's hit "Po Pimp", Twista was signed to Atlantic Records and debuted under that label with Adrenaline Rush and formed the group Speedknot Mobstaz in 1998. His 2004 album Kamikaze went to number-one on the U.S. Billboard 200 album chart after the success of his number-one Billboard Hot 100 single "Slow Jamz."
