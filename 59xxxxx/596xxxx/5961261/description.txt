File: This is the livecd image of Fedora 14 with GNOME. It can be run live, to test it out, without any changes to one's hard drive. Then you can install it to the hard drive.
Instructions: Burn this .iso image to a disk with a iso recorder(e.g. isorecorder). Then boot from the disk, and installation is self explanatory. As am alternative to booting from a disk, you can use a liveusb creator to boot Fedora from a flash drive. (If your hardware supports it)
