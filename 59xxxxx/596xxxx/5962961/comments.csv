[V],Subzero!,2010-11-17T21:56Z,"@rocco_sifredi aka PornMongo!...
you look at my first msg above.

@vaibhav03
who the fuck is tptb ?...

@filipDS
ripping this under 5gb, would mean to remove MP stuff, or recode vids or music... so ALL is in here, that might be the reason. you will see at 
other upcoming versions from other peoples releases. no names!.

@Angerfist_DJ
we do triple check all our releases before we gonna upload them, and even with ""triple checking stuff"" shit happens!. BUT NOT here and this works well, and has ""no china"" crack included. so far, loading , and gaming works flawlessly!. in other words... NO loading crash!."

When I Decided To Rip This Game , I Saw U Have Riped It In Nearly 5Gb's ....So I Left It

And Today I See Globe's Version Is 1.88 GB ??? Dont U Think Its Strange ?

I Dont Have Downloaded The File So I Am Asking ? Whats Rippable In This Rip ? Videos , Sounds ? Or All

And Wat Do U THink Globe Has Riped ? He Says ONLY Languages ? Is It True ?"

,MakMan06,2010-11-20T09:14Z,"Dudes. Instead of tormenting Globe how about you spend more time making better rips. Give me on good reason why (as an English speaking gamer) I should waste 5.54GB on this torrent when I can get the exact same thing (which I did, and it's perfect, might I add) for 1.88GB from Globe. Until you ""team"" start beating this one bloke in size and quality, show some bloody respect."

Even directions as simple as ""Extract from 7-zip"" followed by ""play"" aren't helping. When I open 7zip and ""add to archive"" it just compresses everything into one giant file. That's all I've been able to do. How the heck can I get this to play?  "

,Sublime570,2011-01-19T08:56Z,"@ nincow.
It's very simple.
1.Extract the files WITH 7-zip or WinRAR, what ever you use. Extract them to a folder of your choice.
2. Look inside your folder once the extract is done and click the Loader.bat file.
3. DONE.
If you really think this is hard you definitely are a noob. But hey, we all have to start off as noobs. If you find this hard try getting one a razor1911 ISO game to work."
