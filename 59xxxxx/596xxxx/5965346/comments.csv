A; pretty good"
,danielheale12345,2010-12-03T20:31Z,"well maybe if the fucking screenshots worked, we could all see if it was worth downloading before we watch the 1st 5 seconds and then realise that the quality is horrendously (idk how to spell it) shit. if you watched this back and realised it was so crappy, (which u obviously didn't) you wouldn't hav even bothered with the upload. Yes it may be a free copy of the film but come on, it's a waste of time even watching this copy"
,hopenhope,2010-12-07T05:49Z,Watchable. better to wait for a dvdrip if you can.
,icone71,2010-12-08T01:24Z,"V:6.5
A:6.5
But it seems the audio &video are somehow slow, not 25fps.
Very watchable for a cam."
,Pingsterness,2010-12-13T06:21Z,"video is a good 7 to 8 for a cam, audio is 5-7 for a cam, in one or two spots out of sync but definitely nothing major, definitely watchable, I suggest you download this if you don't want to wait for DVDRip. Great upload, thanks Bone! 

Whoever posted it's a A2V2, they're idiots, this is a good cam."
,atownbound09,2010-12-16T00:04Z,"Do not download! Nothing more than an advertisement/trailer, not the actual movie. Don't waste your time or bandwidth..."
,twexile,2010-12-17T02:33Z,For a cam v5/a8.
,bluesskyflyer,2011-01-30T01:13Z,"Watchable for a cam, but this has to be the most stupid movie I've seen in a long time.  Sooooo many holes you could pick in it , I can't begin to start. ABSOLUTE rubbish.   Pathetic tosh. Really really really BAD."
