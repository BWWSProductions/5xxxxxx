Game Info


In the 14th century a quarrel over English succession to the French
throne escalated into what history would call the Hundred Years War.
This ongoing war had exhausted the standing armies of both sides and
there was a growing dependence on mercenary soldiers. Take charge as
a mercenary leader and contract your army to the English and French.
Watch the battle begin as arrows rain from above, knights charge on
horseback and cannoniers fire volleys at heavy infantry. The style of
action enables you to defeat large numbers of soldiers with one chosen
attack command. Establish a reputation as a warrior and a leader and
watch as the toughest of men will battle at your side. Outwit your
opponents and overwhelm them with force to be the last one standing.

Greetings  Respects

To all active groups which where worth to greet and of course all
oldskool ones, which never sleep! :)
