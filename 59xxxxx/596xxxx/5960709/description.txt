Individually, Edgar Winter and his brother Johnny Winter are powerful artists, but combined, they are virtually unstoppable. In this live set, the brothers are just having the time of their lives, digging deep into their bag of favorites, and pulling out smoking renditions of the Sam & Dave classic \"Soul Man\" and the Righteous Brothers\' \"You\'ve Lost That Lovin\' Feeling.\" The history of rock & roll continues with Little Richard\'s \"Tutti Frutti\" and \"Good Golly Miss Molly\" and Chuck Berry\'s \"Reelin\' and Rockin\'.\" The Winters go Detroit on Mitch Ryder\'s \"Jenny Take a Ride,\" and pay homage to the king, Elvis Presley, with \"Blue Suede Shoes\" and \"Jailhouse Rock.\" From start to finish, Edgar and Johnny are having a rockin\' & rollin\' good time, and that happiness channels over to the listener.
