,marceltoppie,2010-11-21T17:31Z,I can confirm that this one works .... Ive PAL xbox WITH the new dashboard update so it is not AP2.5
,marceltoppie,2010-11-21T17:33Z,TY pickled_egg .... I had my doubts before downloading this one but it works tyvm
,lastjedi,2010-11-22T14:13Z,it doesnt matter if this game works.abgx doest have this game in their database yet so it cant be stealth patched yet.if you play this game on ur xbox ur gonna get banned.wait till abgx has this game in their database before playing it so you can have it stealth patched.
,caxluis,2010-11-24T16:05Z,"The game is fine. However, if you have firmware 1.6.1 you will need the activation disk. (the one used for the old 1.6 firmware)"

,Twiddler_13,2010-11-28T05:17Z,"Is this the one put out by ""Global""? If so, ABGX has it in their database now.

If not, then nevermind."
,clockmma,2010-12-05T09:57Z,i have been downloading and bringing games for well over a year and i use to stealth every game but i stopped a long time ago and still have not been banned call it being lucky i play online all the time with halo reach and cod black ops and im not banned so don't worrie about playing a game just because it wont pass abgx stealth but if your so worried about it play it off line or make a diff account and play it on that so to say your gonna get banned if you play this or any other game no matter what thats bull thank you and have a nice day ps. im not saying i wont be banned just the likely hood of it happening for playing harry potter is slim to none :D
,jonmaxx,2011-02-15T17:47Z,"I'm not a n00b or anything, but I was wondering if anyone else may have any information on what I had encountered.  I haven't updated the dash on my xbox yet, but when I pop in the game for HP, it prompts me that the game needs to update my console with a 4 MB update.  I have never said ok.  Anyone know what it is?  Can I install it and still play?"
,jonmaxx,2011-02-18T21:33Z,"Okay, so I went ahead and said yes to the update.  Just in case anyone else is wondering the same thing I was --

The update was for the new dashboard that hadn't been downloaded.  Apparently, Microsoft has embedded the update into this particular game to force you to update before you play it.  I updated the system via the game, and I was still able to play it afterwards.

Good job on the great upload!"
