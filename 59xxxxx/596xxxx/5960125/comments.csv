,mojobaby27,2010-11-17T07:09Z,Anyone know if this works forced NTSC? It's an EA game.
,Czoftik,2010-11-17T10:03Z,Hello i have little problem. I get freeze while selecting profile. Does anybody knows how to fix it?
,moldymike,2010-11-17T18:12Z,i get the same problem
[V],totomas1,2010-11-18T09:53Z,"The link above (from bloodomen5) doesn't help in this case. It only applies to the pc-game. I hope someone has another fix when the game freezes. I haven't tried it yet myself, so it might work for me :)"

,mojobaby27,2010-11-19T19:25Z,"SOSteam,

Thank you, works great,  forced NTSC, changed ios to 223, since others had freeze, and turned on EA 002 fix."

,jrr6415sun,2010-12-15T02:46Z,"can anyone teach me how to ""force"" a game to be NTSC? I will send $10 with paypal email me at jrr6415sun at aol.com"
,mnutzz,2011-01-01T16:37Z,"If you are using CFG USB Loader you can select the game, select options and then set video mode to force ntsc.

Although, for me, forcing NTSC and using ios233 got me through the very first stall were Voldamort arrives, but then crashes again when you meet hermione.  I shall keep experimenting :)"
,mnutzz,2011-01-04T12:04Z,"Found a solution.

Upgrade ISO233 to version 5.  You don't need to run in 'Force NTSC' either."
,Keithuk,2012-02-10T20:05Z,"It works for me on my 4.3E with USB Loader GX.

There is a part 2 if you Google it."
