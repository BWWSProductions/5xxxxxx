Four American soldiers who are in Iraq are sent on a mission to recover plates
for printing 100 dollar bills that were used to print a billion dollars. After
doing the job and returning to the base their commanding officer is killed in an
explosion and the plates are stolen by another operative. They would be court
martialed and sent to different prisons. 6 months later, the leader, Hannibal Smith
is visited by a CIA spook who tells him he knows where the man who took the plates
is and wants him and his men to recover it. So he helps him escape and he breaks
out the others and they go after the plates. But after doing it, they discover that
the spook might not be ok. And a military intelligence officer who was involved
with one of them is pursuing them.
