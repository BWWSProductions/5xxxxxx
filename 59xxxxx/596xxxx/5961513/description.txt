These are true stories told without script or notes in front of a live audience.

The Moth was founded in 1997 by the novelist George Dawes Green, who wanted to recreate in New York the feeling of summer evenings in his native Georgia, when moths were attracted to the light on the porch where he and his friends would gather to spin tales. The first New York Moth event was held in George's living room and the story events quickly spread to larger venues throughout the city, and around the country.

The Moth has presented more than three thousand stories, and yet it's practically impossible to get a hold of any of them, which is why I am uploading them here.
