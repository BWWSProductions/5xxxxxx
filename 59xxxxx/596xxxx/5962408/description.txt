CLK Rebellion released a new beta of the open-source Party Buffalo Drive Explorer that will allow you to access Xbox360 formatted drives/usb-sticks/bins:

I just pushed out version 1.0.0.4 -- here is the changelog:
* Update fixes bug with closing drives
* Fixes bug with extracting folders on a hard drive
* Might fix bug with some USB drives(I say might, because it's a ghetto fix. * If it messes up on yours, please message me regarding the issue)
* Added extracting of Security Sector
* Added extracting of Josh sector
