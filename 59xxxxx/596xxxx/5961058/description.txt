    Si King and Dave Myers continue their search for           
   best family of cooks with 40 families from      
    across the UK competing for the title. Their special     
    guest is Bill Oddie, who cooks sesame tuna with noodle    
    stir-fry. The bikers serve up their dish of the day,       
    cauliflower fritters with roast garlic, and viewers can   
    cook along to the seven-minute supper - sauteed          
    mushrooms on toast with parmesan cream and crispy bacon.
