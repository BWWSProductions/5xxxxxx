,rakz2cul,2010-11-18T19:20Z,yes right...very small in size
[V],-jonny-,2010-11-19T00:07Z,Nothing surprising about it. It's animated.
,Seeganga,2010-11-19T00:10Z,why non DTS?
,MoviesR101,2010-11-19T08:48Z,Screw MKV! MP4 Is Better!!!
,agent1su,2010-11-19T20:10Z,hey MoviesR101 you dumb shit mp4 are for loosers who dont know how to play the awesome mkv file. thanks aoloffline. MoviesR101 Fuck off if you dont like this download MKV Rules MOTHER FUCKER
,dallanlee,2010-11-19T21:34Z,"haha It always makes me laugh when I read about people arguing over ridiculous things. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. And we don't have to convert everyone to our way of thinking. I mean come on! Calling someone a mother f@#$er just because they want a different movie format?! hahahaha 

Look. I think the MKV format is AWESOME because of how it can be compressed so small with great quality and the multi-audio and multi-subs can be all in one. But it is a bit more uncommon and it's new to most people. A computer won't just play it through iTunes/QuickTime or Windows Media Player automatically. MPEG-4 is AWESOME as well because so many devices can recognize the format and the Apple TV is becoming a big hit so it's nice to have movies with the .mp4 extension for the Apple TV. Everyone will have their favorites. For me personally, I want anything not in divx or .avi extension. haha But there are also those who prefer divx. It's all good. I'm just grateful for those who rip, convert and compress. I'll take it however I can get it! haha

I use the WD TV Live Plus so I don't have to actually worry about file formats, but I may be getting an Apple TV and I have family members with Apple TVs so I try to get .mp4 when I can.

I am downloading this now. I plan to comment on quality once downloaded. Thank you aoloffline for the upload!"
,flextm71,2010-11-20T01:44Z,"agent1su - I can't play .mkv on my awesome PS3, so I agree that mp4 is best. I can convert the .mkv, but it is so time consuming. MP4 is a very popular format and is compatible with most technical devices. 
I wish secretmyth were here..."
,flextm71,2010-11-20T01:55Z,"dallanlee - As far as quality goes, there is not much difference between .mkv and .mp4. If you convert .mkv to .mp4 with 100% quality, the file size will be close to the same. Having to convert these files is frustrating, but just something we all have to live with. Personally, I wish there was only one .whatever. Then we could all live together in peace and harmony..."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-20T17:00Z,meh... none of you know what you are talking about.
,dallanlee,2010-11-21T03:01Z,"@HolyRoses

""Don't know what we're talking about"". We're opinionating. I do know what I'm talking about: just my damn opinion. What good did your comment do? It didn't add to our conversation in the least. Would you care to expound on what we don't know?

@flextm71

Yeah, they are comparable in quality at the same size. But matroska gets the upper hand, just slightly even. Honestly, I would prefer all MPEG-4 movie files for convenience but I appreciate both."
,Metroidn1f,2010-11-22T04:56Z,"Actually,sometimes when you use mp4 as a container, the file will be a bit bigger because of its Format Profile of Base Media."
,majuaraan,2010-11-22T10:25Z,MKV is the new AVI
,cypsun,2010-11-22T15:50Z,"I bought a samsung plasma tv last year with usb in the back,download film avi,mp4,mkv plays them all right out of the dongle. The beauty about mkv over mp4 though is the surround format. M.K.V. files can be compressed with D.T.S where as the mp4, i have to use double stereo with a matrix effect.Its still surround but its not 5.1 true surround. I am just thankful that people upload at all,I am stuck in a foreign desert country and I would not get this movie any other way.So thanks uploader for your effort."
,the.gonzo.bear,2010-11-25T04:06Z,"i love how people are straight trippin over Shrek Forever After... grow up people... 

thanks for the up aoloffline, always comin in with the clutch uploads :-)"
,khnpirate,2010-11-25T10:55Z,Anyone with a PS3 can simply watch any MKV file by running the file through MKV2VOB first.  Its a quick process 1 minute for most movies and then you can watch the movie on your ps3 streaming from your computer with TVersity.  
,darkscale,2010-12-01T19:18Z,er...? why do folks want to watch DLed movies on a console anyway? Just hook a PC to a TV and a surround receiver. At least that's what I do. RealTeks HD sound is pretty good for a built in processor and I'm using a DTS 5.1 receiver with satellite speakers.
,jeebexton,2010-12-04T17:02Z,"just finished downloading - seeding now -
video quality is a good true 720p -
audio is a little quite however when played through a home cinema set it is quite acceptable.

9/10 (due to the audio) 

thanks for the upload "
,zossie,2010-12-04T17:05Z,"Thanks for the upload, great quality!
A 10/10
V 10/10"
,WanneCoole,2010-12-11T15:10Z,Does anyone know how to convert this to a file that can be read by a ps3 without loss of quality ?
,NerdsterX,2010-12-12T04:52Z,Great Quality!
,triden,2010-12-12T18:19Z,"jeebexton:is this really true 720p??

Correct me if im wrong but 720p should be 720 lines right?
and this movie is 1280 * 544 (544 lines?)
Or im i wrong this is not 720P?"
,shizilao,2010-12-15T12:11Z,"Hey guys. To my understanding, MKV is not a video format, but something rather like a casing, which can contain different formats of video, audio, sub and chapter file, including mp4 and rmvb. Other such ""casings"" include AVI and m2ts, but MKV seems to be the outstanding one. "

And by the way, 720 is just the maximum number of horizontal lines."
,niggyniggnigg,2010-12-18T17:32Z,"holyroses is the shiz...

if he says you all dont know what your talking about, you might be ""opinionating,"" but you need a new opinion if you wanna be correct.

,Dizz61208,2010-12-25T06:00Z,How do you or can I know if a movie is in MP4 format?  Feedback another please!!!

,KeyReath,2012-02-18T00:49Z,"For anyone having issues watching different movie formats, download media player classic - home cinema. I highly recommend this player. When vlc let me down, media player classic did not. It plays flawlessly, is way more user friendly and even has a better looking icon than vlc player. 

In the middle of downloading this torrent now. Will comment later about AV ratings."
