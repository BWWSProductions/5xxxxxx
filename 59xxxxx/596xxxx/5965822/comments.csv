,Dimmis80,2010-12-30T07:42Z,"I played yesterday your mod and from my point of view i find it very good..Job well done.But i have some sugestions or thoughts to post about it.:

1)Where are the Zulu and the British Troops and leaders from the movie Zulu and reality i read there are in  the mod for the custom battles.I can't find them in the custom battles section.?

2)The British did they have Martiny-Henry rifles in the Sudan campaign or different rifles because there are just the Vanila muskets.?

3)About the Cavalry they don't have the ability to use Wedge or Diamont formation and stuff.No formation at all.?

4)About the starting colonial artilery there are 4 cannons but they use only the 3.?

5)I like the Gatling a lot and its leathal and stuff but 120 if i remember correctly to use it and stuff.?

6)In the Nations name section it says British and stuff and not United Kingdom.?

These are the things that i can remember."
[T],Tanauser,2010-12-30T15:06Z,"Rifles are maritini Henry  ; Revolver are Webley
and British army is Natal Contingent ; 

if you don't see these ; you must have the wrong installation"
,Dimmis80,2010-12-30T17:33Z,Just a sec.@Tanauser u mean that in the Gordon/Sudan Campaign the British have the Martini rifles equiped.In the game i mean.!?Or u have them just in the Zulu for the custom battles.??I used this torrent and there is an another torrent that is exactly the same with this torrent which i found in some forums.!?To be honest it don't look to me like that is the final release that i play but like a previous beta one or something..?And i put all the files in the correct places.??What do u think.?
,Dimmis80,2010-12-30T19:44Z,Nevermind @Tanauser i solve the problem..I just play a battle with the British against the Zulu...AWESOME dude just AWESOME..Great skins/Models and stuff-Maps-Rilfes.I love the music inside the battles and generaly.Very pro mod.Congrats again mate..No i will play with the Zulu this time..
