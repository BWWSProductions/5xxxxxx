You have to extract the application: ""Garmap_SA_Streetmaps_2010.3_NT"" with winrar or winzip and then in that there is a folder named:  ""SA street maps""

Open it and you will find a setup file run the setup and the maps will be installed.

Then you need to go to the folder ""Garmin unlocker""

In that folder there is a batch file called 'All'
double click it to run it and your new maps should be installed and unlocked.

Great upload
Thanks"

Obviously doing something wrong"

Here's better instructions:

meh can't figure out how to install this, after running Garmap_SA_Streetmaps_2010.3_NT.exe it takes me to a page online asking for a serial key :/

Ok this is what you're supposed to do:

1. After downloading Garmin South Africa 2010.3 Map + Unlocker right click and extract 'Garmap_SA_Streetmaps_2010.3_NT.exe' with Winrar ect

2. After extracting, navigate to this 'Garmap_SA_Streetmaps_2010.3_NT\SA Streetmaps\Setup.exe'

3. Install the MapSource program

4. After installing the program go to the 'Garmin unlocker' folder from the torrent and run the All.bat file

5. After running the file close the cmd window and open the MapSource program, there should be a shortcut on your desktop.

6. Select the 'Map Tool' button above, then select areas of the map that you want on your Garmin.

7. Then click the 'Send to Device' button above, the maps will now be transferred to your Garmin device.

Tested on Garmin nuvi 205, working perfectly, thank you!"
