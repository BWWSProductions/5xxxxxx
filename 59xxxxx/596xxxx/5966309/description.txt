Unlike most sequels, Time Further Out is a worthy successor to Time Out. Among the numbers introduced on this impressive set are Its a Raggy Waltz and Unsquare Dance (the latter an ancestor of Don Ellis Pussy Wiggle Stomp). The selections, which range in time signatures from 5/4 to 9/8, are handled with apparent ease (or at least not too much difficulty) by pianist Brubeck, altoist Paul Desmond, bassist Eugene Wright and drummer Joe Morello on this near-classic.

Time Further Out is a 1961 release by the Dave Brubeck Quartet. It features the Classic Quartet: pianist Dave Brubeck, alto saxophonist Paul Desmond, bassist Eugene Wright, and drummer Joe Morello. The album was recorded by engineer Fred Plaut and produced by Teo Macero.

Overview

Time Further Out continues the Dave Brubeck Quartets exploration of unusual time signatures that began on their 1959 album Time Out. The tracks are ordered by the number of beats per bar, starting with It's a Raggy Waltz and Bluette in 3/4, "Charles Matthew Hallelujah" in 4/4, "Far More Blue" and "Far More Drums" in 5/4, Maori Blues in 6/4, Unsquare Dance in 7/4, Bru's Boogie Woogie in 8/8, and concluding with Blue Shadows in the Street in 9/4. The time signatures are listed on the albums cover, where they are incorrectly referred to as "tempos". Like Time Out, Time Further Outs cover features a work of modern art: a painting by Spanish artist Joan Miro.

With my vinyl transfers, I try to catch the whole beauty of vinyl records; therefore I don't use any post-processing or any sound improvement. What you get is a clear and flat transfer. For getting a clear sound, I'll do an extended washing of each record with my RCM, which can take up to 30 minutes brushing on each side. Resistant ticks and clicks I try to remove as good as possible, but the priority is not to lose any musical information in the process. Surface noises, as long they are not too high, are left in place. Only on bad pressings or on records recorded at extremely low levels do I use a fade in-/-out. As John Peel said, "Life is full of surface noises." In some cases this means that I have to make a compromise.... The result has to pass my personal quality criteria, which is IMO quite high.
