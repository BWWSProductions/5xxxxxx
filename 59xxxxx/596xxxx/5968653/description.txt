IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:Russian proper xvid ............. Thanks
AUDIO:OWN LiNE

Here we go with skyline... now for this we used the russian proper xvid as it's the best video to date... However it's not the best thats for sure :( Video is blurry, colours were off, theres some borders for the first few mins, had some noise aswell... Anyway we filtered the video the best we could and also changes the res... still nothing great,but watchable on small screens or laptop. Audio was pretty good for line,but was a bitch to sync as there seemed to be missing footage in several places but only like 15 secs here and there... Anyway enjoy, until we have a better video source :)

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
