,klondikex,2010-11-22T04:37Z,"P.S. For what it's worth, bigbluesea is right at least to the extent that THIS IS A REALLY BAD MOVIE.  Bad bad bad.  Cloverfield it definitely ain't."
,natascore1000,2010-11-22T19:07Z,"I have to assume that klondik is joking,Cloverfield is the worst shit ever simply becouse of the way it was filmed,completly stupid,i liked this movie but i like most alien take over earth movies but its no WAR OF THE WORLDS,(a real movie). Quarantine was filmed like cloverfield but becouse it was a zombie movie it was much better, but still a stupid way to film  "
,LOLiverPB,2010-11-23T04:26Z,Cloverfield is an excellent movie. Entertained me at least ALOT. wich few films today do.

Cloverfield meets War of the Worlds meets Godzilla. Decent acting with main character played by Eric Balfour of Valemont (MTV) and Haven (SyFy)  fame. Also, from the ending, it looks like there could possibly be a sequel."
