***UPLOADERâ€™S NOTE*** - This film has only been released as a PAL  DVD, and the only torrent for that is so badly seeded it took me a week to download it. I have ripped it to the highest possible resolution allowed by DVDFab, with two passes. The original bears the hallmarks of a filmed TV show that was not cleaned up prior to release on DVD. In other words, itâ€™s a bit grainy.
In any event, the film is exceptional in all major areas. The history is essentially accurate, it has huge stars, it is well acted, it is sweeping, majestic, and itâ€™s a hell of a lot of fun. Itâ€™s an absolute CRIME that films like this from the Golden Age of the Miniseries (Roots, War and Remembrance, etc.) are not better known and watched today. This is a must-view for history buffs, but I really encourage the younger crowd to take a chance. See what TV used to be like when it really, really tried not to be crap. Thrill to the acting chops of Gielgud and Houseman; be bathed in pure quality of production values. Fans of reality TV need not apply.

Marco Polo (c. 1254 â€“ January 8, 1324) was a Christian merchant from the Venetian Republic who wrote Il Milione, which introduced Europeans to Central Asia and China. He learned about trading whilst his father and uncle, NiccolÃ² and Maffeo, travelled through Asia and met Kublai Khan. In 1269, they returned to Venice to meet Marco for the first time. The three of them embarked on an epic journey to Asia, returning after 24 years to find Venice at war with Genoa; Marco was imprisoned, and dictated his stories to a cellmate. He was released in 1299, became a wealthy merchant, married and had 3 children. He died in 1324, and was buried in San Lorenzo.

Il Milione was translated, embellished, copied by hand and adapted; there is no authoritative version. It documents his father's journey to meet the Kublai Khan, who asked them to become ambassadors, and communicate with the pope. This led to Marco's quest, through Acre, into China and to the Mongol court. Marco wrote of his extensive travels throughout Asia on behalf of the Khan, and their eventual return after 15,000 miles (24,140 km) and 24 years of adventures.

Their pioneering journey inspired Columbus[1] and others. Marco Polo's other legacies include Venice Marco Polo Airport, the Marco Polo sheep, and several books and films. He also had an influence on European cartography, leading to the introduction of the Fra Mauro map.
