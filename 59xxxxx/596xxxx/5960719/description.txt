The Spice Girls were an English pop girl group that formed in 1994. The members consist of Victoria Beckham (nee Adams), Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Melanie Chisholm and Geri Halliwell. They are signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single, \\\\\\\"Wannabe\\\\\\\" in 1996. The song hit number-one in 31 countries and helped establish the group as a \\\\\\\"global phenomenon\\\\\\\". Credited for being the pioneers that paved the way for the commercial breakthrough of teen pop in the late 1990s, their debut album, Spice, sold more than 23 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in music history. They have sold over 75 million records worldwide with only four albums and twelve singles, making them the best selling girl group of all time. Measures of their success include international record sales, a 2007â€“2008 reunion tour, merchandising, record-breaking achievements, iconic symbolism such as the Union Flag dress, \\\\\\\"Girl Power\\\\\\\", a box office hit film Spice World and their nicknames.Background information
