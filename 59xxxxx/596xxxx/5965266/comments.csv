,muthineni,2010-11-18T18:04Z,"thank you 20-40 for southpark

one question
 - when it shows 4 or 5 seeds, does it mean those only 4 or 5 have downloaded the entire pack and r now seeding????
i m sure  a lot of people like me get one or two eps n seed their part but r not shown as seeders. correct me if i am wrong."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-18T18:54Z,"@muthineni: It depends on tracker-servers and their ability to perform scratching (constant two-way communication about which, how-much and when some packets (data) have been requested, sent and received. From three years back none of the tracker servers doesn't do ""well"" any of that functions. Openbittorrent tracker is down 99% of the time and he is the only one which allows scratching from TPB. Numbers one get from TPB database are invalid. Numbers one can see in his client are rubbish too. DHT accepts ""partial downloads"" and if one choose to download just a part - his DHT would report download as finished. 
Peer exchange add to that mixture a lot - and at the end - no one gets the numbers right.

It isn't so just on private-tracker/club sites, but TPB is public, open site, and therefore, especially in light of recent attacks, practically destined to rely on DHT alone, and downloaders must stop to look at the numbers, as they have been used too, because it's plain rubbish.

Only way is to have newest uTorrent/BitTorrent, not to allow unencrypted traffic at all, have PeerBlock, Firewall running and open the TCP/UDP port-pair above 55000 exclusively."
,killeurkilleur,2010-11-18T18:56Z,"@ muthineni : ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND !?!?! HOW DARE YOU ASK A QUESTION LIKE THAT TO THE MIGHTY 20-40 ????

BE CAREFUL...HE MIGHT GO BATSH*T INSANE ON YA !!"
,killeurkilleur,2010-11-18T18:57Z,@ 20-40 : now ...you see u can talk like a normal person WHEN you want to...
,jon4fun,2010-11-18T19:02Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode(s)/upload.

Cheers
Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-18T19:19Z,"Addendum: From August my seeding server fell into range blocked by PeerBlock. Many downloaders who use this ""must-have"" program should add my server to 'permallow' list by right-clicking on my 91.121.1.144 (in case of TV shows)  and choose ""Allow permanently"". 

I gave detailed instruction few times before, and if one has slow download, that might be the cause - I seed at 8000 - 24000 kB/s and that should be fast enough for anybody."

,muthineni,2010-11-18T19:39Z,"thank you buddy. 
that clears a lot of my doubts on the wierd numbers on your packs seeds 3 peers 108.. thats practically insane..stupid trackers lol

btw  my max d.speed is 50 kbps only but never got anything less than the max for ur downloads.
so no complaints from me at all. "

,lilars26,2010-11-18T22:38Z,"I think 'Friday Night Lights' is one of the best shows of all time.For some strange reason I find myself caring about these characters.Maybe it's the writers,maybe it's the actors and maybe it's the well placed music.Or maybe it's nostalgia for days long past.I've never been to Texas but I can relate to the lives of these teens and adults."
