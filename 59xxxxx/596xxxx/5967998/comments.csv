@ppravin88: You meant ""encode and up one""?

HolyRoses torrent is dead, only encode that fit into your asking.

I can encode Truman as ipod psp zune (272p) H264 and put it inside 272p movie-pack I plan to up on Sunday.

@justregged: No problems at all with showing helping hand when asked. I cannot give nothing more than you."
