,cygor64,2011-01-28T04:04Z,This version sucks.  The last version was the best so far. v7
,worple,2011-03-09T15:13Z,The virus is in the keygen. Be careful!
,RafVne2,2011-07-27T13:16Z,"Some sort of bull... it's in zip, then it's zipped again and you have to unzip each zip to get full set of yet another zip... plus no sign of a keygen either... it's a scam.Plus .gif file has subroutine that tries to connect to internet. "
,RafVne2,2011-07-27T13:30Z,I found a keygen in cr-apd18.zip... who the hell came up with the idea of nesting so many damn zip files?
,RafVne2,2011-07-27T13:48Z,For what it's worth it does work. It's just a pain to keep unzipping it all
,vj_ip,2011-11-06T23:28Z,Perfectly worked...excellent utility...thank you Blacktroy...
