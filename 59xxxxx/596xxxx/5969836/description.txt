Heart - Crazy on You [TopPop 1977] VHS.mkv 



HQ very rare tv show promo. AVRO's "TopPop" was the first weekly pop program broadcast on Dutch television. It ran from September 22, 1970 to June 27, 1988. 

"TopPop" was mainly filled with pop artists in the top pop studio, playing to their latest hit. During the years of 1970-1974, 1978-1981 and 1986-1988, the artists were selected by the choice of the Viewer. In the years 1974-1978 and 1981-1986, the National Charts were used instead.

"Crazy on You" is the guitar-driven debut single from the female-fronted (Nancy and Ann Wilson) rock band Heart's debut album Dreamboat Annie, released in 1976. Starting with an acoustic guitar intro, the song turns into fast-paced hard rock that was the signature sound of the band in their early years. "Crazy on You" attracted attention both for the relatively unusual combination of an acoustic guitar paired with an electric guitar, and the fact that the acoustic guitarist was a female â€“ a rarity in rock music during that time. 

The song's lyrics tell of a person's desire to forget all the problems of the world during one night of passion. During an interview on Private Sessions, Ann Wilson revealed the song was written in response to the stress caused by the Vietnam War and social unrest in the United States in the early seventies. 

"Crazy On You" became the band's first commercial hit, peaking at #35 on the charts in the summer of 1976. Despite its modest chart, "Crazy on You" remains as one of Heart's signature tunes and is still a staple on U.S. classic rock radio stations.

*NOTE: I have been uploading the very best of what i have in my collection, but thought i would also post a few of the rest of what i have downloaded from the net over the years. Their video quality may not be as good, or their resolution may be odd, and so on. For example, the original file for this video had a odd resolution of 352x576. The Media Player Classic played it at the correct aspect ratio of 768x576 (4:3) just fine, but takes the screenshots at the original odd resolution, so i had converted them to .mkv to get a correct screenshot to use when i posted it, but decided to post the .mkv conversions since the "DivX Plus Converter" allowed me to pass through the original AC3 audio and the video is about the same quality. Hope you enjoy them also :)
