,Norwegian-FunFun,2010-11-25T15:00Z,"Hi Update V11.1.1 has come out but this pack is for V11.1.0.. Can I still Use it?
I just want the face, logo and Kit pack.
Can I just past them or do I have to past the hole pack?"
,reyder8,2010-11-25T20:29Z,"Norwegian-FunFun
Yes. This pack should work on this latest version and subsequent updates to the game ..)
On my version 11.1.1 works perfect.)
I only recommend one file ""logos.fmf"" to paste in a folder with my documents. 
Thanks for you comment."

Can somebody please tell me exactly how to put the graphics in game? I installed the offline version, not steam."
,reyder8,2010-11-26T06:04Z,"Copy ""Data"" folder to directory you installed the game."

,Lankoz,2011-01-17T23:04Z,"Need help, downloaded and copy and pasted the 'data' folder as instructed but now when I start my fm2011 game, there is no skin, its completely white and only link such as new game etc is showing. Anyone having same problem?"
,therippeRz-,2011-02-05T18:56Z,Seed please!
,euphoria4949,2011-02-16T07:51Z,"Well I give up!!
I have used graphics packs on FM for years so I know where to put the files, but no matter where I put these they just ain't working!
It maybe because I'm running the updated 11.2.1 version or not I don't know.
It's really frustrating because it was a really slow download too, it took around 7hours to download!

I'll keep the files in case someone can offer some advice........ ANYONE.....????"
,bjk94,2011-03-20T06:43Z,I can only get the faces and other features to work when I am using the dark skin but I'd like to use them with the white one can anyone help?
