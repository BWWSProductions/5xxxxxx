This bug is in all 1.2.2 versions of the game, no matter which one you download its gonna be there, the developer of the game made the bug, there is nothing you can do about that.

""Most of you know that the recent update has cause some new bugs. The most annoying of which, is the block regeneration. When you're holding down the ""break"" button with a tool, the blocks can regenerate up to like 5 times before dispersing entirely. Annoying huh!

Well to fix this, break blocks without holding down the ""break"" button. So hold down the button just long enough for the block to break, then let go."""

me again, thanks it worked, i switched monsters from false to true, i understand why you had it turned off tho. here are a few more questions that are bugging me i hope you find the time to answere them.
1) You can't create obisidian, lava and water changes into cobblestone, how can i fix this.
2) Can you find redstone rocks at all, because i didnt encounter one yet.
3) And the last question is, why can't i create hell gates. I tried to light my *admin made* obsidian and it didnt work. Any idea how to change this? Also i tried to turn hellgates from false to true but after that it didn't let me into my own server, So i had to turn it back to false."

This update breaks mostly all mods, plus has tons of bugs in SMP and SP.

I suggest you wait for more stable version as NOTCH is updating it like every few hours, by tomorrow you might see v1.2.4 lol

""The Word of Notch
Iâ€™m expecting bugs on this one, so Iâ€™m monitoring the usual channels (irc, twitter, email) extra carefully.

Basically everything I talked about in the last post is done, with some extras such as visible hurt animations (how did I forget that?) and visible fire on burning mobs.

The lighting still isnâ€™t right, I need to rewrite it. I think I know what the problem is now, though. Or rather, I know what ONE problem is. You know when youâ€™re traveling by boat, and you see weird strips of light on the ocean floor in multiplayer? That.

Also needed is visible armor on players and mobs (sheep!), and some tweaks to reduce laggy moving mobs. And bows and arrows.

There are a couple of new settings for the server:
pvp. True by default. If this is set to false, players canâ€™t hurt other players.
spawn-monsters. True by default. Set to false to remove all monsters.
spawn-animals. Also true by default. Set to false to remove all animals.

[edit:]

Wow, that broke the game. Hold on while I try to fix stuff.

[edit:]

Iâ€™ve uploaded a new server and a new client, fixing the two major bugs I heard about.
I had to disable leaves decaying again (sorry!) because it caused infinite loops in certain situations.

Keep me posted, and Iâ€™ll keep fixing!"""

,GonnaCreepOnYou,2010-11-25T14:42Z,"Hi NanoEntity! Thanks for this release!

I've been trying to make the server work for quite some time now. Here's my problem:

I know you recommended using Tunngle, but I went with Hamachi instead since the free version requires no registration etc., reasons like that.

But that's not the problem. This far I only managed to connect the server and the clients with Hamachi in a way I'm not supposed to. Others can join the server when I start with ""minecraft_server.jar"". This way I can change the server's IP in ""server.properties"" to the my computer's Hamachi IP. But this way the game is horribly buggy.

By starting the server with ""launch.bat"" (like I should, according to the instructions) I can join my own server from the same machine and the whole thing seems more stable, but the server's IP cannot be changed, it will use the default 127.0.0.1. So others can't connect through Hamachi.

What can I do?

(Also, by running ""launch.bat"" there's no server GUI. Can I bring it forth somehow?)"
,GonnaCreepOnYou,2010-11-25T15:02Z,"Oh and I forgot to mention that portforwarding doesn't work on my network. The reason is complicated, let's not get into that. That's why I chose Hamachi in the first place, because I knew I couldn't forward ports.

As I said, others can connect without any problem when I change the server IP to the Hamachi virtual LAN IP and run ""minecraft_server.jar"", but ""launch.bat"" will start the server with 127.0.0.1, no matter what."
,dragonphire7,2010-11-25T16:41Z,"thanks for the response. end of stream, did all that, still get error.

as for server ip, i have the same type of issue as Creep, in the fact that the server is using 127.0.0.1 for the ip which is not the internal or external ip of the server. i don't have hamachi."
,NanoEntity,2010-11-25T21:00Z,"""launch.bat""
Has a Server Console
Just type ""help"" for list of commands.

127.0.0.1 - is Local Host/ is your own computer, is whatsmyip.org, ITS YOUR OWN IP ADDRESS! ITS YOUR SERVER ADDRESS, ITS TUNNGLE IP, ITS HAMACHI IP, don't make no difference.

That is your server IP, changing it dose not matter at all, it dose nothing, 127.0.0.1 becomes for example 65.789.345.890, there the same IP, get it?

Only thing that matters is PORT, if the PORT is not open no one will be able to connect.

And Minecraft uses :25565 or :25566 or TUNNGLE 11155 or HAMACHI no idea what port it uses.
1) Run Server
2) Go to http://www.whatsmyip.org/ports/
3) Look for Custom Port Test
4) enter 1 of the ports listed above
5) if 1 of them is open your good.
6) if there all closed you can not host a server.

And I strongly recommend tunngle, it supports over 255 users on same network and it works.

If you have a disabled ""Play offline"" button: (Thanks to OdeonDeathstalker & xaian)
1. Open Minecraft.jar from wherever you downloaded the torrent to, then close the game. This creates the "".minecraft"" folder in the C:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Roaming directory.
2. Press Win+R (or go to Start -> Run if it's on your Start Menu), type %appdata% (exactly as shown) and press Enter. A Windows Explorer window will open to C:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Roaming on Win7 or C:\Documents and Settings\[UserName]\Application Data\ for WinXP.
3. Copy the contents of the ""minecraft 1.2.2.125"" (not the whole folder, but the contents of it) into the "".minecraft"" folder. 
4. Open Minecraft.jar from %appdata%\.minecraft
5. Type anything or nothing into the Username and Password boxes and click Login (Enter doesn't work). It will say ""Login Failed"", but the ""Play Offline"" button will not be grayed out, which it will be if opened from any other folder."
