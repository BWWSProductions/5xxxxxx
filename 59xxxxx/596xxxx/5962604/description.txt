Plot
Emmet is ambushed by three men while he sleeps in a deserted shack. In a brief gunfight he kills all of them. Unbeknownst to him, these men worked for a man named Ethan McKendrick whose father Emmett had killed. Emmett had just been released from prison after serving five years for the killing. As he travels to the town of Silverado, he finds a man, Paden, lying near death in the desert. The men with whom Paden had been riding had robbed him and left him to die.

Emmett and Paden ride to the town of Turley to meet Emmett's brother, Jake, who has been jailed, and is awaiting hanging, for killing a man in self-defense. Paden is also jailed when he finds one of the men who robbed him and kills him. Emmett breaks the two of them out of jail and the three escape with the help of Malachi Johnson, a black sharpshooter who was run out of town by Turley's overzealous sheriff, expatriate Englishman Langston.

After helping a wagon train of settlers recover their stolen cash from a group of thieves and leading them to Silverado, the group disbands to find their relatives, or, like Paden, settle into the town. Emmett and Jake learn from their sister's husband, the federal land agent for the area, that McKendrick is attempting to maintain the open range, which he will dominate with his enormous herds of cattle, by driving all lawful claimants off the land through violence carried out by his paid henchmen. Mal finds his father's farm has been burned down, overrun by cattle, and his father has been driven onto a nearby mesa, where he hides in a cave.

The group soon discovers that the town's sheriff, Cobb, an old friend of Paden's, is on the rancher's payroll and is defending the actions of the man's thugs. After McKendrick and his men burn the land office, capture Jake, shoot Emmett's sister and brother-in-law, and kidnap their son, Augie, Paden determines to defy Cobb. The four stampede McKendrick's cattle to provide cover for a raid on his ranch, in which most of the cowboys are killed and the kidnapped boy is rescued. The four then return to town where, in a series of encounters, each defeats his personal antagonist. In the last of these, Paden kills Cobb in a classic Western fast draw duel. Emmett and Jake leave for California, their long stated goal, Mal and his sister reunite and decide to rebuild their father's homestead, and Paden is now the sheriff of Silverado
