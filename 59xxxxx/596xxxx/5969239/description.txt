Plot: Three couples set off to spend some time in the desert. At first all is well and they all have a lot of fun (if you know what I mean!). Watching their fun is a mysterious stranger in a pickup truck, who has plans for some fun of his own that the youngsters aren't going to appreciate. (Written by Rob Hartill.) This is a VHS-Rip that has good quality to be from that, a VHS cassette. Sadly, it has 1.33 aspect ratio. Haven't seen any widescreen one yet. Hope some company releases it in DVD format soon. Love this desert-based slasher. Funny and violent at the same time.
