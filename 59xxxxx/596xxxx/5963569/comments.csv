Will seed to 2.
Cheers"
[T],honchorella31,2010-11-18T18:37Z,yes the source i used is from a well respected HD Group REiFINED.
,tejagamer,2010-11-19T08:17Z,"Saw the sample just now
Its awesome clarity
Thought to go with SecretMyth as i usually do his uploads only
But after seeing this, I am downloading this
Bad thing is that my speed is capped at 512Kbps = 64KBps max..
So takes time...
1GB Done"
,falconss,2010-11-19T11:23Z,"Your source and S.M are the same in this movies. But you are giving us a higher resolution (1920 x 800) and a min bitrate of 2972 kbps for 200MB extra :) That is G8 honchorella. 
I know it take lots of time to get those parameters that you are giving. 
All of you at kingdom-kvcd and other sites are providing a great service to the net, and I am sure all of us who are downloading your rips appreciate the effort and the time you have put in each single movie. Again G8 Work and Thank you.
