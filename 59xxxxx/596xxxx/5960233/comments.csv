thanks"
,sndman148,2010-11-16T18:12Z,"Thanks for the quick upload!!

Files are m4a not FLAC, so they are ready to go in iTunes!!

Thanks again!"
[T],tmax666,2010-11-16T18:43Z,"Please don't misunderstand.  This is NOT the iTunes set.  The iTunes set is in lossy AAC format.  

These files were taken from the recent remasters in Apple Lossless.  This allows uncompressed audio quality PLUS you can import them directly into iTunes without the need of converting FLAC files."
,jammeke,2010-11-16T19:11Z,We need the Box-set that's available in iTunes today ... :-/

[V],Kitlope,2010-11-21T10:43Z,"So, basically, you threw in the ""itunes"" buzzword in the title for more hits. Brilliant."
,bsinclair,2010-11-23T16:36Z,"Thanks for this, but what happened to T6 on Yellow Submarine - Octupus' Garden ?"
,phoenix12239,2010-11-23T20:34Z,Thank you so much from all The Beatles lovers all over the world!
,joluboga,2010-12-03T21:29Z,"So tmax666 gives you the entire Beatles Remastered discography in a LOSSLESS iTunes compatible format and all you people do is complain??? WTF??

tmax666, I don't have an iPod because I really don't like those little things, but nevertheless, I appreciate your upload and all the trouble that you went through to rip all of your remastered CDs to offer us a much better sounding option than what iTunes is selling for like 150 bucks"
