,MPAAss,2011-08-06T21:56Z,I second that question! Why?
,Vicar in a Tutu,2011-09-04T15:32Z,"6-8GB+ gives a much higher video/audio bit rate.

High bit rate = crystal clear image and sound
Low bit rate = blurry round the edges, compression artifacts, lack of fine detail, possibly a stereo mix instead of surround sound.

Experiment yourself. Download two 720p versions of the same film. One @ 300-600MB and one @ 4-8GB. You will need a fast computer or dedicated HD media player to play the high bit rate stuff at full speed."
