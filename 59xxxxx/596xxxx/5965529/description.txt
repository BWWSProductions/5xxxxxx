                    The Van.                                 
                    Drama about an Indian doctor who moves to a  
                    Welsh mining village in 1963. Dr Sharma comes  
                    up with a plan to diagnose the miners' health  
                    problems, and a rather unusual van arrives in  
                    the village. The driver, a well-known rugby  
                    player, creates a real stir, and it looks like  
                    the doctor's luck is changing for the better.  
                    Mr Sharpe is furious, and does his best to turn  
                    the locals against the doctor and his van -  
                    although Mrs Sharpe is rather taken with the  
                    new arrival. Meanwhile, Gina gets some shocking  
                    news, and the crucial diary goes missing.
