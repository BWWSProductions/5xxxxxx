I'm gonna check this out because I am a Denzel and Tony Scott fanatic, but the dvd screener will probably appear in the next week."

im not questioning you, but what makes u so sure, ive been waitin on despicable me for months. but there has been alot of screeners lately"
,some-young-guy,2010-11-17T03:49Z,"I hope there is soon a screener for Skyline.  Even though someone else said that the movie was not directed well and the story had too much fuzz in it, I still think it'll be a good movie if the viewer can understand the concept."

The audio is louder than usual for a cam rip, with a little distortion during the really loud action moments, but it holds up well. Very watchable copy! Thanks to the uploader!"
