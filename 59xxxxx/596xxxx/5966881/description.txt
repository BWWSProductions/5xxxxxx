True Romance (1993) Director's Cut

Director: Tony Scott

True Romance is a 1993 American romance crime film written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott. It stars Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette with an ensemble cast.

Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore and James Gandolfini are among those in the cast. Val Kilmer is heard but not seen mainly in silhouette as Elvis Presley.

True Romance was a breakthrough of sorts for Tarantino. It was his first screenplay for a major motion picture. He had hoped to direct the film himself, but ended up selling the script.

The film's score by Hans Zimmer is a theme based on Gassenhauer from Carl Orff's Schulwerk. This theme combined with a voiceover spoken by Arquette is Tarantino's homage to Terrence Malick's 1973 crime movie Badlands, in which Sissy Spacek speaks the voiceover, and that also shares similar dramatic motifs.

A fast paced thriller written by Tarantino which is in his usual vein of work. The film stars Christian Slater as a guy who marries a prostitute only days after meeting her. In order to prove his love, he goes to her pimp (played by an almost unrecognizable, not to mention incomprehensible Gary Oldman) to inform him she will no longer be working for him. Things donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go quite according to plan and he ends up stealing a large amount of drugs as he leaves. Obviously, the gang are not going to let Slater get away with this, so pursue him as he and his new wife, Patricia Arquette, try to find a buyer for these drugs.

Typically Tarantino, the film is full of gory comic moments, with a very funny appearance from Brad Pitt as a stoner, and ends in a bloody showdown, but will the newlyweds live happily ever afterÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
