The directors cut is super, you should put that in your title (you'll get more hits)
I had a hard time finding this, I have a VHS retail Directors copy but it's worn out now. "

I can't stand watching it for more than 1 minute."

Your comments are ignorant.  DVDRip.  Now how about YOU creating some torrents and put some booty on the table for the rest of us.  You DERP!"
[V],big_dad_e,2011-01-07T03:23Z,"BTW, update your codecs, or better yet, burn the file to a DVD and view on a stand alone player."
,swampmatt,2011-01-09T05:30Z,"Thanks for mentioning ""Director's Cut"" in the tags. I avoid the 'extended' and 'director's cut' because it makes most movies boring. "
