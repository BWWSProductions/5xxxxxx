Maria McKee has a huge range of style in her voice from fragile as a butterfly on songs like "Nobody's Child", and "Has He Got a Friend For Me", to the full on wallop of stuff like "This Property is Condemned" and "Panic Beach".  Her lyrics are smart, engaging, and often times touching.  Along with that, you have assistance from the likes of Ricard Thompson, Jim Keltner, Tony Levin, and the excellent production of Mitchell Froom, who has made so many great albums with Thompson.  This album is can't miss, so don't.
