This is the 1280x720 Dutch HD video feed from the first Armin Only 2010 in Utrecht.  The quality of the feed is great, although it does contain occassional drops or pixelations.  Overall, a fantastic rip.

Instead of posting this to some pay-site for file sharing and trying to make money off it, I have un-RARed the source and letting this loose on the world.

MKV format - Intro and Main show are two separate files.  Main show was broadcast for 3.5 hours.

I will try to seed this for the next 2-3 months.  Everyone who truly loves this kind of content, please seed for a long while to share the wealth.

Enjoy!
