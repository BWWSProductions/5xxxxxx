                    Young Hearts.                            
                    Drama about an Indian doctor who moves to a  
                    Welsh mining village in 1963. Mrs Sharma, the  
                    doctor's wife, is desperate to get out of  
                    Trefelin, but when local tearaway Dan gets into  
                    trouble, only she can help him. The doctor's  
                    friendship with Megan deepens as they realise  
                    that the old doctor's diary holds vital clues  
                    to the deteriorating health of the local  
                    miners. Mine manager Sharpe tries to persuade  
                    the doctor that health hazards are just an  
                    unfortunate part of a miner's job, and teenager  
                    Gina is falling recklessly in love.
