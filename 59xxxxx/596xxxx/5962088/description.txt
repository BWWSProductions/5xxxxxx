[i][b][color=red]Storyline:[/color][/b][/i][b] MC Stevie Hyper D (R.I.P)
The Origin of the modern day MC.

Stevie's style was fast paced and fresh and when he started chatting people hadn't really heard anything of this calibre before. He combined dance hall style and lyrics with his own streetwise tongue-twisters to literally leave crowds in awe. This guy was simply on another level.

From Fulham in south west London, he came up through the acid techno scene in the late 80's and early 90's first making an impact with the release of techno ragga alongside appolo 440. After that he started getting bookings for raves like Telepathy, Labyrinth, Elevation and Utopia.

He soon became the main event MC'ing alongside the likes of Micky Finn and Nicky Blackmarket and was the first name punters looked for at any DnB event. By 1995 he was the biggest MC in the game and destined to break into the mainstream getting booked all over the UK and smashing up Kool FM and other regional pirates.

Tragedy struck on July 4th 1998, Stevie Hyper D died of a heart attack the morning after performing at a rave in Maidstone, Kent, coincidently on the same night as friend and fellow MC Ruff. Many rumours surfaced around the time of Stevie's death, but it is widely accepted that he died as a result of a pre existing heart condition. The scene had lost two of its biggest soldiers and they have been sorely missed ever since. Even now his tribute raves are sell out roadblock events and his name still rings out from mc's across the world paying their respect.

[b][color=gold]Encoders Notes:[/b][/color][i] This colection of MP3 was not encoded by Release-Lounge. Time was spent gathering these and then tidying up the file's ie Names/Artist/Albums etc so it looks nice in your Itunes. These MP3 were mostly gathered from rips of 'Cassette Tapes' hence some of the mp3s are not amazing quality, but you wouldnt throw away a rough diamond. A massive thanks goes out to the people who originally ripped these from their Tapes, without them this collection would not be possible. If you have additional Stevie Hyper D tapes, please rip them to MP3 (google this if you dont know how) up them to a site likeand contact us at Release lounge and we will see about updating this torrent in the future. 
The man should be remembered by everyone, whether you were there or not.
