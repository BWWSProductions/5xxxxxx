Dire Straits - Sultans of Swing [Old Grey Whistle Test 1978] VHS.mkv 



HQ "The Old Grey Whistle Test" 1978 tv show live performance. "Sultans of Swing" was the first single release of therock band Dire Straits. It was first recorded as a demo at Pathway Studios, North London, and quickly acquired a following after it was put on rotation at Radio London.

The song was originally released in May 1978 but did not chart. Following re-issue in January 1979, the song entered the American music pop chart. Unusually, the success of this single release came more than six months after the relatively unheralded release of the band's debut album in October 1978. BBC Radio was unwilling to play the song due to its high lyrical content; after it became a U.S. hit, their line softened. The song reached the top 10 in both the UK and the U.S., reaching number 8 on the UK Singles Chart and number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and helped drive sales of the album, which also became a hit. 

I would like to add that Mark Knopfler's guitar performance in this video is better than the studio recorded version. With his amazing spot on guitar solo work, and an all around top notch performance throughout the whole song, it's easy to see that he has to be one of the best guitar players of all time!

*NOTE: I have been uploading the very best of what i have in my collection, but thought i would also post a few of the rest of what i have downloaded from the net over the years. Their video quality may not be as good, or their resolution may be odd, and so on. For example, the original file for this video had a odd resolution of 352x576. The Media Player Classic played it at the correct aspect ratio of 768x576 (4:3) just fine, but takes the screenshots at the original odd resolution, so i had converted them to .mkv to get a correct screenshot to use when i posted it, but decided to post the .mkv conversions since the "DivX Plus Converter" allowed me to pass through the original AC3 audio and the video is about the same quality. Hope you enjoy them also :)
