,derk66,2010-11-17T12:50Z,"now where do you get the assumption that when the download is slow, you need a new computer.
:/
Is it something in the food that makes ppl so dumb nowadays ?? or is it just me growing up, and im just seeing what the world is about ..........  lol

,dargonhuman,2010-11-19T10:44Z,"Thanks so much!  It's BS that we gotta wait a whole freakin' MONTH for syfy.com to upload these; we shouldn't have to wait that long to catch up if we miss an episode or two.
You're a life-saver eztv.  Will seed as much as I can (not that you seem to need it lol!)"
,pimpmobile,2010-11-20T05:01Z,"I can't believe you people are still into this crap it has no action, it's all talking and nothing but a bunch of relationship crap like a soapopera!"
,SquirrelSack,2010-11-20T08:36Z,"
Hey Guys, Could you please also watch SGU on your respective TV networks when it plays. Or just turn it to the channel and leave it there cause I heard that viewer ship is good but not amazing so season 3 hasnâ€™t been given a green light to shoot yet. Like for sure download the torrent, I did to  (just couldnâ€™t waitâ€¦.) but if you like the show and want to see it continue, watch it on TV too.     Thanks!"
,Sattori,2010-11-20T20:23Z,Thanks! Best episode of this season! And I got my final confirmation that Col. Young is a moron.
,Sattori,2010-11-20T20:27Z,"@pimpmobile
For gods sake, get lost and watch something different. "
,Sattori,2010-11-20T20:40Z,"Thanks for this hint SquirrelSack.
Everyone should follow this advise who is able to."
,lobo275,2010-11-21T04:43Z,THIS IS NOT MALICE (s02e08).  It is The Greater Good (s02e07).  Sad to see no one say it yet.
,Skram0,2010-11-21T09:39Z,"THIS IS IN FACT MALICE. Go look up the episode description of Malice.

""Lucian Alliance prisoner Simeon escapes, creating a manhunt on a remote planet.""

I definitely see the remote planet they're talking about in this video, where Rush kills that guy in the end on the planet. Took me like 3 minutes to download this just to see, and you're wrong."
