NOTES:: THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST 36 MINS OF THE FILM. It has a big WB watermark throughout it, nothing i can really do and is only really visible in the dark scenes. Looking over it, it could be a workprint but it was labelled as dvdscr so i\'ll leave it as that. With the audio it seems the voice comes out the left speaker and everything else right speaker, so to fix this make sure your click the mono option under audio devices in vlc player. Check sample before you start complaining.
