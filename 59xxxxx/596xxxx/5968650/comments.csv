Ok i cannot get this reduced of a file size for 1080p video i use DVDFab as its the easiest i use the.mkv format which i love, quality and audio is awesome but still comes out at least 26gb. help please. my dvd's i use xilisoft dvd ripper ultimate 7, the audio and video come out not in sync 100%. i want quality and full 16:9 picture but i also need easy to use software cause im not a genius in figuring out how to rip with audio tracks then a video track and remerge them, thats to much work. i just want to click rip and then move the file to my wdtv. so if you could provide some simple guidance i would greatly appreciate it. thank you."
