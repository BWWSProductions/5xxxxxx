The sixth edition of "General, Organic, and Biochemistry" is designed to help undergraduate health-related majors, and students of all other majors, understand key concepts and appreciate the significant connections between chemistry, health, disease, and the treatment of disease. 

This text continues to strike a balance between theoretical and practical chemistry, while emphasizing material that is unique to health-related studies. The text has been written at a level intended for students whose professional goals do not include a mastery of chemistry, but for whom an understanding of the principles and practice of chemistry is a necessity. Designed for the one- or two-semester course, this text has an easy-to-follow problem-solving pedagogy, vivid illustrations, and engaging applications.
