The IMG file seems to be very small also, compared to previous versions."

,irishhatty,2010-11-21T14:37Z,"pls seed......usually with this type of file you need to:-  1. rename sd card ""GARMIN""  2. open sd card and make a new folder and name this ""garmin""  3. put gmapsupp file into this folder(delete the "".img"") 4. place sd card into slot in garmin device  5. go to maps on device and select these new maps and de-select you previous maps. 6. happy motoring.      will confirm this when i manage to d/l this torrent"
