This is a highly watchable copy, couple of people moving around now and then, but its right at the bottom of the screen, so hardly noticable.
V7/A8 imo

Thanks again"

,condem78,2010-11-18T11:52Z,"out of all the copys out there this one is far better and watchable, i agree with antz172 although i would rate @V7/A7 its a very good copy for a film thats only really just been released, as for the film i and our lass are in to sci-fi and we enjoyed it, yeah it strays off now and again with the characters, BUT it is a disaster film in the sense that for once we dont get to kick the crap out some alien race like we normally do in these kind of films, ive given it the BIG thumbs up. just my own opinion like,
cheers to the uploader scenebalance for this great copy "
