,Calitucky,2010-12-07T02:10Z,"Wendy,
 I've also ALWAYS loved your game shares, but this one crashed my Windows XP. Have you any idea what happened?
 I was able to get to the Scarecrow, but that's when everything went ""Blue"".
 I'm kinda afraid to try any more.
 Don't let this comment stop ya... you're the best."
