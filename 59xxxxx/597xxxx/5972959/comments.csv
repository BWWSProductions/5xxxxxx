,voidmain79,2011-01-02T17:16Z,"Dosen't seem to work :/
I unpacked the files with 7Zip.
Burned with growisofs on Linux.
Xbox recognize the disk as an regular DVD movie and just shows a logo... Nothing more.

But this is the first time I burn a Xbox360 game with Linux so I don't know if that might be the problem. But since no one else got this working (?) i suppose this torrent is bad."

,RomanCl,2011-07-12T10:17Z,I couldn't even extract this shit
