-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fallout Revived Installer 1.3.5.1

This installer will take care of everything. Contains the unofficial patch
(version 1.3.5) by TeamX and the High Resolution Patch made by Mash (2.2b).

Many thanks for them making it possible to play with this decade-old game even
on Windows 7 x64!

After installation, download the Fallout Revived Data Files, otherwise you
won't be able to run the game.

Also check out the valueadd folder, it contains a few additions.

Install: just use the exe provided, it will install to "Games" in your user
folder. Then you can run Fallout from the Start Menu.

If the game crashes on run, check whether fallout.cfg exists. If it doesn't,
run bs_run.bat and it will create it. If it fails for some reason, copy
fallout.cfg.in to fallout.cfg, and replace the REPLACEME string with the
install path everywhere (5 occurrences in total).

Uninstall: go to Control Panel, and use "Add or remove programs" or "Uninstall
a program". Alternatively, use "Uninstall" from Start Menu.
