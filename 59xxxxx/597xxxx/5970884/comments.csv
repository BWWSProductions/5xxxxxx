,Markstar.PB,2010-12-20T12:19Z,"Is there an ""official"" forum or something?

I'm pretty sure this one has a bug:
The screen flickers on my desktop machine (C2D, Radeon 4870, Win7 x64), but not on my laptop (C2D, Intel onboard graphics, Win7 x64). I have tried all settings and resolutions, all with the same result. 

Fallout 2 Revived works on both machines, however, so it's only this one. :("

but this is a known bug and there's no fix for it. it flickers for me as well, but i just got used to it after a while :)"
,Markstar.PB,2010-12-23T19:12Z,"Thanks for your reply, anarki2!

Luckily it works fine on my laptop, so I don't have to get used to it (which I think I couldn't and would rather not play it). ;)

Interesting though that it's just F1, since both are based on the same engine."
