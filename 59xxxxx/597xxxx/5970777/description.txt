This in not an actual digital copy of the Nedwerk Portfolio from Capabel Taal.  And that is a required step in most local town councils for you to get your integration certificate.  It is re-written and is probably 99% accurate.  The forms would most likely pass as clean copies as long as the formatting is correct.
A4 is something different from where I come from.  :P


Regardless, if you must integrate yourself in the Netherlands you may need to complete a portfolio such as this, which can be hard to come by at the local city hall.  It took me over a year for me to receive mine after many annoying phone calls, emails, and meetings.  So here it is, why not go ahead and finish it if you know you'll have to do it anyways?  Enjoy being one step ahead!
