PLOT:


US Army sergeant Cody Cullen's horror tour in Afghanistan ends when his mate Jonesy is blown to pieces while they deliver medical supplies in Nurestan. Cody is sent home to return private possessions to Jonesy's bride turned widow. On his way home he passes Nevada City, California, where he meets Faith Spelman, who writes the parish's Christmas cards to lonely soldiers, coincidentally including him, an orphan. He happens to save her dad Luke from a serious car run-over. The Spellmans invite Cody home for dinner, then the Christmas tide. He proves a great help in the family logging firm. Vietenam vet Luke wants Cody as son-in-law, but although charmed, Faith still seems committed to rarely present fiancÃ© Paul, a wine broker. 

In the midst of war in Afghanistan, Cody Cullen (John Newton) is touched by a lovely card sent by Faith Spelman (Alice Evans) from the small, picturesque town of Nevada City, California. As months pass, the card never leaves his side, giving him the strength to survive and setting him on a mission to find her.
