,DevilNuts,2011-02-17T08:08Z,"Huge improvement over 4.1 that I used in my CCNA course. 

5.3 Allows you to configure dynamic ACLs, which older version had trouble with. 

VMPS support still not present :( 

Great tool if you are studying for CCNA... Anything more advanced probably requires an actual lab with higher-end gear. "
,DevilNuts,2011-02-17T08:10Z,"Oh, and THANK YOU for the upload! 

I will see if I still have any of my old labs saved from CCNA, but chances are I deleted them after the course. If I still have any, they're yours. "

Thanks. 

Seed & Enjoy. "
