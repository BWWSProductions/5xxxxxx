Seems to have worked out well for a 1st attempt at hardcoding subs."
,jennerden,2010-11-21T23:33Z,For some reason - there are no Input-file here :-(
,786AAA,2010-11-22T08:57Z,Sorry 'jennerden' I have no idea what your referring to. Please elaborate. 
,jennerden,2010-11-23T19:21Z,"Hi 786AAA

This is the message I get when I try to dowload the torrent-file.
""No input file specified.""
Looks like your torrent file is no longer reachable.
Would have loved this with eng. subs.

I''m really trying to work this out, but I'm confused. So far I've had about twenty people download this with no problems. 
Have you tried the 'Magnet Link'?? Sorry If I'm being to basic here but I'm stumped as to why your having problems. Have the other torrents you downloaded ever given you this message?

Let try to fix this for you!

,jennerden,2010-11-24T08:58Z,"Hi again 786AAA

Yes the Magnet link worked but it didnÂ´t seem to have any seeders. Left it there overnight with no result.

Never had this problem before - but it can be a glitch - no worries.

,786AAA,2010-11-24T12:08Z,"Ok Jennerden, seems like your getting closer. My PC was on all night & I was seeding so maybe the problem is elsewhere. Keep at it and I'm sure it'll work!

Peace."
,786AAA,2010-11-25T16:09Z,"Hi jovong00
Sorry dude but I'm at a loss. I've currently got 7 people downloading at a fairly decent bandwidth..
Any ideas from other users out there would be appreciated. "
,786AAA,2010-11-25T16:39Z,"OK TRY THIS ONE AND SEE IF IT WORKS
