,Jeremiah37185,2010-12-20T17:49Z,How do I get this to play on my Xbox? Unpacking seems to fail once it gets to the iso level and it is to large for a standard dvd. Do I just need to burn the iso and dvd file to a high capacity blank dvd or what?

you need to unpack and then burn to a double layer dvd-disc. I think you also need a modded xbox360 for this game to work."
