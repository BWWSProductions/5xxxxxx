,rayk64,2010-12-09T09:15Z,"If more people would enable initial seeding for this torrent when they load it, it'd probably be spread throughout the swarm faster."
,WesX,2010-12-16T02:54Z,This is a great upload. Only problem is that it's Region B. So if you're in the USA and you burn this to a BD-R and try to play it in a PS3 or Blu-ray player it's not going to play.

,jpd456,2012-05-06T05:43Z,"Well got down loaded, finally.  Converted the folders on disc 1 to an .iso so that I could burn em to disc.  Did a check first on on Intervideo BD player.  Won't play - Region B!  No big, ripped with Anydvd to iso, tried again with intervideo, no go.

Basically Anydvd HD is unable to make these discs region free so..... if your in the US and have bought your player here (region A) don't bother with burning them, you won't be able to play em.  That said, If someone has done it, I'm all ears :)"
,F413,2012-05-06T23:11Z,"Firstly i cant understand why any1 would need a single movie file this big. So in other words if you don't know what you are doing, probably have no business downloading this torrent. Also to the people who were wondering how to watch a movie on their TV, get an HDMI cord, they save lives."
