oh well, back to eztv then, i guess."
,Revrant,2010-11-23T10:54Z,"And then you have a dumbass wanting the other one.

Ignore him, GG guys, XviD first so we can actually DL it!"

Bye bye! Eztv only cares about Jay Leno's show being up first."
,claytown,2010-11-23T20:42Z,"hey guys, if you don't really care about quality..
you know it's streaming up on the coco website, right? 

i don't care which one goes up first, honestly. 
i just want them to upload the 720p also, for those of us who like good quality.

if they upload both of them in a timely manner, then i'm happy. no need to get all defensive.

and as for leno...um, hey.. his show DOES air first.
i'm no fan of leno, but you're just reaching :P"
