,SleepyJake,2010-11-27T23:51Z,"Nevermind, fixed it."
,Tash_Alistair,2010-11-29T20:53Z,"Yeah, for some reason Every once in a while, SOME people will get a dll error. if you do, try exiting out of everything, and then restart. and then run your exe from your NEW directory. i had the same problem. i exited out, changed directories, and bam, done deal. one of the readme files i wrote should clear up any issues you guys will have, i actually INTENTIONALLY tried to get errors, so i could tell ya how to fix em."
,Tash-Alistair,2011-12-02T01:57Z,"Sorry guys, i need to re-DL this, TPB for some reason will not let me log into my account, so i had to create a new one, i will be doing this for all of my torrents, i am truly sorry for the inconvenience."
