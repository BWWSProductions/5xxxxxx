,vulkmus02,2011-06-02T14:36Z,"Thx raidy!  I appreciate your efforts!  I would like to begin uploading.  Is there a way to protect one's self or do you pretty much just upload with no real changes?  For example, do I need a service that will block someone from tracking my IP address?  Not sure what that means, I am a little new, but would like to participate in sharing."
