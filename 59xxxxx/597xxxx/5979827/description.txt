ReleaseNotes:

Few musicians have the stylistic reach Detroit rap-rocker Kid Rock displays in bringing together musical guests as disparate as country music sweetheart Martina McBride and rapper T.I. รยน and on the same track, no less. But that's one of the nifty surprises Kid Rock pulls off on his eighth album, making strange musical bedfellows sound like kindred spirits to boot.

That also may have something to do with the presence of producer Rick Rubin, who once again demonstrates his uncanny gift for chipping away the bluster and artifice from the acts he works with, helping them sculpt their songs and performances down to what really matters.

Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,
HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality
of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
