,MuzikJunki,2010-11-24T00:44Z,"Hey FXG_team,

I'd like to let you know, I only trust you to download from, never gotten a virus, always good quality, awesome sized uploads. So I don't download from anyone else.. AT ALL.

BUT, there's a couple of movies I want that you don't have up, or could you suggest someone you trust as well that would have them?

theREBOUND with - Justin Gartha? And Catherine Zeta-Jones.

I Love You Man with - Paul Rudd and Jason Segel.

And, I love You Too with - Brendan Cowell, Peter Dinklage, Yvonne Strahovski, Peter Hellier and Megan Gale.

Any chance of getting those uploaded? Or at least linked to someone trustworthy who has them?"

All uploaders with green skulls are reliable. For example TvTeam, VTV, EZTV, Scenebalance, BONE, Raymonhome, hiest, Zen_Bud, Greenbud1969 and many others. I'm downloading stuff released only by uploaders with green skull and I've NEVER had any problems.

Thanks FXG for upload!"

I was in the Danish Recon Squadron and never got around to see this in the Theater and it isnt coming out on Dvd.

So I must thank you for this release!"
,MuzikJunki,2010-11-29T01:20Z,"@ Dramat,

,parasites,2011-03-14T20:13Z,You would have to be a member of the Danish Recon Squadron or just danish to whant to see this. A GOOD OLD PROVO FILM WOULD BEAT THE PANTS OF THIS.

As always with the FXG_team, the quality is superb.  The movie itself was pretty good too, I definitely enjoyed seeing it from the perspective of the Danes (being an American).   

This movie is in Danish mostly and does not have hardcoded subtitles.  The torrent does contain subtitles for use with the film, but if you're downloading to watch on a PS3 like I did, you'll need to embed the subtitles yourself.  In case anyone out there needs help, I found this page very useful in doing so.  Looks complicated at first, but incredibly easy.  http://www.afterdawn.com/guides/archive/adding_subs_to_avi.cfm


Thanks FXG_team, I sincerely do appreciate all your uploads!"
