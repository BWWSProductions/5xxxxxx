,yazz00,2010-11-22T13:41Z,is the show any good?
,captaind,2010-11-22T23:16Z,Terrible show.  I doubt we'll see a second season.
,95433312,2010-11-23T02:44Z,This show sucks big time. Don't waste your time. It is terrible.
,rlywndr,2010-11-23T07:02Z,"Agreed, it is terrible.  The rip quality is excellent, but the show itself is just awful."
,kangy3,2010-11-24T04:02Z,"I watched the show on TV, I know it's only been one episode, but it was really bad. The guys have no personality whatsoever, only one can drive. And who tests 3 lamborghinis by having a drag race? thats stupid they are supercars and hypercars. UK top gear would driven across several countries to test them."
,yazz00,2010-11-24T20:18Z,"finally watched it, sucks big time. Guys got completely no idea about European cars & culture, there were bulls and corrida to introduce Lamborghini, because it's got a bull in the logo, but it's a freakin ITALIAN sportscar! Now c'mon, that's just disrespectful!
Also, their accent is terrible."

TvTeam thanks for the rip as always :)"
,captainronito,2011-01-05T17:21Z,"Just saw a couple episodes, 1 and 7.

Awful.

Who ever chose the presenters for the US version should be given different duties.

The writers should find other work as well.

I hope it improves, but for now
the US version is just awful. Zero fun so far.

Glad UK Top Gear is imminent."
