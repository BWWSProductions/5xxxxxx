,onecki,2010-12-17T16:55Z,@Yangy PLAYSTATION does EVERYTHING. except cheesey family games including Forza. Since these are Blu-ray one would expect some forums would shed some light.

,ozboywizard,2010-12-20T21:35Z,can i play this on 3.41
,Zeroformer,2010-12-21T10:54Z,"To play this game you need Hermes v4 Hex and Open Manager.
You have to install the Hex (every device has its own Hermes-Hex). And you have to install the Open Manager (pkg).
The Hex will appear the version into 3.50 (but you still have 3.41). Then patch the game with Open Manager (just load it and Open Manager will let you patch it) and load the game with the backup manager. "
,Zeroformer,2010-12-21T11:08Z,"@Yangy555

1. PS3 Firmware must be 3.40 (download update file and update to 3.41)
X:\PS3\UPDATE\PUB-File

Download: downloads.exophase.com/685/ps3-firmware-341

2. You need a USB Dongle like Open Kubus, AT90 or PIC18f2550. You also can use the one from ps3break.

3. Search the right hex (hermes) for your device. You need a programmer to flash it on.

,Guttorm2k,2010-12-21T22:44Z,"This game will onlu run on fw 3.50....for the moment. If you have a ps3 with JB, its on fw 3.41 and it will not run the game. A black screen will appear when starting the game... 

Download the game and wait for a fix, or buy it! Don`t waste your time... "
,oikjgbvguiugfc,2010-12-24T16:05Z,yeah this game doesn't work yet.
,Zeroformer,2010-12-25T12:40Z,"@Guttorm2k

That is wrong.  I do have AC Brotherhood for example and 3.41.

You need the right hex for your device (called 3.50 spoof) and the Open Manager.
Flash the hex and install the Open Manager. Then load the game with it and it will ask you to patch it.
After patching it load it with your Backup Manager.

The 3.50 spoof shows in the options 3.50 but you still have 3.41 :)"
,Zeroformer,2010-12-25T12:42Z,"The hex also is called Hermes v4:
