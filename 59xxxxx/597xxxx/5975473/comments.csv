,koala_koala,2011-01-06T10:08Z,"This file has a fuckin' trojan... ""Oh yeah it's clean! Clean like a weasel!!!"" Besides that: Thxs 4 keygen. I deleted the trojan an leave the Installer_EN app. Good morning RedHat."
,falco07,2011-01-07T01:03Z,Why is it that it can't run now??? it works fine before but now its error. has anyone encountered this problem?
,crtvsoul,2011-01-14T19:42Z,Every Corel Suite on PB has a trojan in the keygen...is there anyone out there with a clean version?  I really need X4 or X5 for 64bit windows ASAP!
,noob3557,2011-03-07T04:19Z,"Thx redhat, works like a charm... FYI running corel on a win7 x64bit system."
,georgewkw,2011-03-17T13:19Z,"I have problem - get to generate the serial number, but the keyengine does not stay open long enough to finish the installion. Also can not type the code genrated by corel into the keyengine. Any ideas?

,Mr.Was,2011-03-26T10:11Z,"nice work
thank you

I have checked - there is no virus or trojan"
,Koshpa,2011-05-01T13:15Z,"The installation works fine but I need the installation code to get the product activated. Can anyone help me on that? And there are no instructions in the torrent file...
My OS is Win 7 64bit"
,Koshpa,2011-05-01T13:29Z,Hehe! got it. You have to take phone activation first to see what's your installation code and the write it down to keygen and activate. Works great! thanx
,MarcMrNice,2011-06-26T07:22Z,"All you noobs finding a trojan!!!!! Get a decent anti-virus. Lots of anti virus programs detect PB installation packages as viruses but guess what?
MOST OF THESE PB DOWNLOADS ARE CRACKED IF YOU WANT STORE BOUGHT PROGRAMS GO TO A FUCKING STORE. Also please stop insulting the uploader by marking everything as FAKE or VIRUS just because you don't have the brains to fugure shit out for yourself! Thanx Redhatcc!!!!"
,Seed_Demon,2011-07-04T22:34Z,"Ditto that MarcMrNice!!!

Lets show some appreciation for the time and effort these nice people are putting in to making these available to you ungrateful bunch of whiners...GO READ SOME ARTICLES ABOUT WHAT THESE ARE ABOUT BEFORE ASSUMING YOU KNOW SOMETHING, YOU MAKE VERY APPARENT YOU DO NOT!  

Then you go and ruin it for other noobs who are now spooked for your inaccurate virus/Trojan claims.  PEOPLE remember ANY tool, legitimate or otherwise, will trigger an AV to tag it as POTENTIALLY unsafe or a threat, it is NOT stating it IS such a thing.  READ THE FINE PRINT, especially using Miscroshit's security essentials. they do not want you using any tools that are not MS VB ASPX framework and so forth so loading them on your machine will trigger it to disable it if you let it and then it won't work anymore. and you write and complain.

FOR THE RECORD...some of us appreciate these uploads THANX!!"
,steelllynx,2011-10-05T21:06Z,What's with the l or 1 or | or whatever in the last section of the installation code?  It won't let me copy it from the activation window either.
,vimal25,2012-01-26T16:41Z,"THANX ,WORKS GR8"
,Makb1,2012-03-19T13:27Z,Thanks. First lost it to Superantispyware false positive.
