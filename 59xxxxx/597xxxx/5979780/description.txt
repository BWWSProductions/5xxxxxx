It*s Cocker's voice, a soulful rasp of an instrument backed up by Madeline Bell, Sunny Weetman and Rossetta Hightower that carries this album and makes *Change in Louise,* *Feeling Alright,* *Just Like a Woman,* *I Shall Be Released,* and even *Bye Bye Blackbird* into profound listening experiences.	



With a Little Help from My Friends is the first album by singer Joe Cocker, released in 1969. This album is credited to Cocker & his band, The Grease Band. The popular title track was featured in a 1975 episode of Saturday Night Live, in which John Belushi (as Cocker) called the song a *musical performance*. It was also the theme song to the popular television series The Wonder Years during the 1980s and 1990s.
