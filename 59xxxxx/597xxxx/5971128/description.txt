Sometimes there's a song that's just too perfectly named.  That's definitely the case with "You Always Make Me Smile" from Kyle Andrews' forthcoming Kangaroo EP (out August 31st).  The track, with it's whistle line and bouncy bright vibe will definitely have you smiling.

The joy continues with catchy ditties "Kangaroo" and "Sushi (Slow Dancing At the Prom Mix)".  Both tracks continue the theme of delightful jangly hooks.

The EP doesn't end as strongly as it begins.  The tepid ballad "Don't Feel Left Out" seems like a throwaway, while the remix of "You Always Make Me Smile" is just too over-beated (to coin a new term).

But that shouldn't detract from what's overall a really enjoyable and fun listen.
