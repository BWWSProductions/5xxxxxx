,mandog,2010-11-21T22:36Z,"man you can't even rip 24/96 what is the point 
and on a diy turntable as the great man once said Garbage in garbage out that's the Linn LP12, aka Ariston RD11 with 50p Philips clock motor, O i did love my Lpi2 with a wooden sided supex. then it was just left behind by real turntables by the way that Sony is a solid metal direct drive that competed with the likes of Technics   "

So I think I qualify to my own opinion. If you  had read my 1st post, My complaint was that you don't take full advantage of vinyl and record it in its full glory 24/96 all vinyl is worthy of that. The LP12 was a fine turntable is 30 years ago but its a budget turntable to what is used today? Still sounds good though still got one in the loft with Ittok and wooden sided supex garret tipped. "
