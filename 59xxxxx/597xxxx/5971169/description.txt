Kevin Bridges: The Story So Far... Live From Glasgow 
is the debut DVD from the UK's fastest rising comedy 
star. Filmed in May 2010 at Glasgow's SECC Arena in 
front of a sold out crowd of 10,000 fans. 

At the age of just 23, Kevin, Scotland's 'Young comedy 
prodigy' has followed a meteoric path, from his appearance 
on BBC 1's first episode of 'Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow' 
to starring in 'Stand Up For The Week'. Other TV appearances 
include 'Live at the Apollo', 'Friday Night with Jonathan Ross', 
'Have I Got News For You', 'Mock The Week', '8 Out Of 10 Cats', 
Channel 4's 'Comedy Gala In Aid Of Great Ormond St Hospital'.

Kevin's unique brand of social commentary, astute observations 
and sharp one-liners arguably make him the hottest act to come 
out of Scotland in the last ten years.
