,Kanegasi,2010-11-30T14:25Z,"I love it when people think the download speed of a torrent is the torrent poster's fault. It may be for the first few hours or even the first day because of initial seeding, but when a torrent has 1000+ seeders, the download speed is only limited by your own shitty connection. Excuse me while my download rides in on a cool 2.5 MB/s. I could do more, but I have my client clip up and down so I can do other things."

Funny and entertaining movie. All of the students in the high school look like college kids, making the movie an inaccurate depiction of high school. Plentiful hot girls is what keeps the male audience looking at the screen. Not highly recommended, but watchable for a few laughs."
,iCLUTCHiEZz,2012-01-01T16:03Z,Fast download speed: 3.3 MB/s
,DoctaMike,2012-01-20T22:09Z,Good job deffjam555. Audio and video is top notch.
