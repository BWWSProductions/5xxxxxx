Allmusic Biography:
Slidawg & the Redneck Ramblers are a novelty singing act specializing in redneck comedy written and performed by Steve Ivey for IMI (Ivey Music International), a music writing and production company based in Nashville, TN. Slidawg & the Redneck Ramblers are just one of many acts helmed by Ivey, who grew up in Swainsboro, GA, and started IMI during his freshman year of college in Macon, GA. Ivey debuted Slidawg & the Redneck Ramblers in September 2007 with a pair of Christmas CDs â€” A Blue Collar Christmas and A Redneck Christmas â€” comprised of novelty songs such as "Rudolph the Redneck Reindeer," "White Trash Christmas," "Up on the Trailertop," "Did You Heared What I Heared?," and "Deck the Doublewide." Distributed by Madacy and sold primarily at Wal-Mart, the CDs charted respectably, breaking into the Top 50 of Billboard's Top Country Albums chart and occupying the top two spots of the Heatseekers chart. The albums were promoted with a video for "Did You Heared What I Heared?" that accumulated over 10,000 views on YouTube, as well as an amusing website (slidawg.com) that established a persona for Slidawg and his Redneck Ramblers (i.e., Cooter Jenkins, Melvin Snodgrass, Rascal Ray Cole, and Darlene Sexton), including an elaborate back story.
