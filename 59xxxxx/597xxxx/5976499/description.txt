Welcome to G-Force

G-Force is a music visualizer for media players and can also visualize auxiliary or "line-in" audio. G-Force features fast anti-aliased visuals, millions of possible effect combinations, savable and scriptable effects, and unparalleled expandability. G-Force is designed to entertain you on its own, but there are many ways it can be customized and extended.
