Recorded at the same sessions as A Fine Intensity (released by CIMP under the
name of the Elliott Levin-Tyrone Hill Quartet) and featuring the same musicians,
Soul-Etude at times rises to great improvisation and outstanding collective
interplay. Released under the name of the Tyrone & Elliott Levin 4tet, the group
looks forward by reaching back to older sounds, particularly in the case of
trombonist Tyrone Hill. You can hear Roswell Rudd's voice in Hill's approach,
his gutsy, raw-edged, sometimes abrasive attack and nasal tone favoring
on-the-beat quartertones to a bop-infused aesthetic. The opening Sun Ra tune,
"We're Living in a Space Age," is a joy, the trombone and Elliott Levin's tenor
saxophone taking the role of the Arkestra's call and response. The other six
numbers (each written by members of the quartet) bring out different sides of
the band. Levin (who is also an established poet) boasts a unique, individual,
and sophisticated style that contrasts with Hill's earthier attack. Bassist
Howard Cooper and drummer Ed Watkins play a secondary role, though the changes
in tempos and the repetitive rhythms require their impressive talents for the
project's success.
