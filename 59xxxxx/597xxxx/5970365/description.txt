Matt Dillon

Matthew Raymond Dillon made the successful transition from teenage heartthrob to respected actor to inspired director, a journey that makes little of his 44 years. With his gravelly voice and chiselled dark features, he has always brought a sense of danger, intensity and even menace to whatever movie screen he happened to grace, while his range of acting and disregard for genre brought him an Oscar nomination and numerous plaudits.
