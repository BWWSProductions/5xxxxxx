I like USAO, I like USAO a lot. As such, I'm releasing this torrent (thanks Muzaffar) since it is a worthy sequel to his mostly-jumpstyle album, Kick's for Liberation. This album focuses more on hardstyle, and is a solid album, and sadly there isn't too much variation (which can be a very risky thing). As a result there are no *bad* tracks on the whole disc, but a few stale ones. Despite that criticism, it's still a good album. Half the album consists of arranges of his first album by other J-Core artists, and they're pretty well done. If you like USAO, you're already going to get it, and if you're searching for some new hardstyle, Kick's for Liberation 2 deserves at least a juicy sample.

My top picks are "Another Sect (USAO & DJ Nanashi Mix)" [man this track sounds like some from the demoscene] and "Sakura Era (DJ Nanashi Remix)".

Enjoy.
