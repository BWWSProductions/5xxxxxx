Don't forget to seed and say thanks everyone. This will be a 24/7 seed, so enjoy!

Like I said, this is a RE-UP of my other torrent. I accidentally set the sampling rate to 48000Hz which caused bass clipping. This torrent is FIXED, PROPER at 44000Hz for your entertainment pleasure. I apologize for the inconvenience of you all downloading a botched torrent. Delete the old songs and enjoy these. Clipping free! XD
