This is the original game disc from the Unreal Tournament 3 collector's edition metal box.  I can upload the bonus disc if I get some feedback from you guys.  This is my first torrent.  I like the idea of being able to seed a torrent as a way to have a backup on the internet without having to sign up for one of those ridiculous backup sites like Mozy (but I like them for backing up secure files, like school homework ;)

So here it is, Unreal Tournament 3.  Original and unmodified.

I also am into customizing windows installation discs and using them to install without having to download updates and such, so if there are any requests for custom windows install discs, I'd be happy to fulfill those requests.

I DO NOT

let me repeat that

...I DO NOT:

OFFER ANY KEYS, KEYGENS, CRACKS, MODS, OR SERIALS THAT BYPASS PRODUCT IDENTIFIERS

Enjoy this torrent, and if it has success, I will probably upload more
