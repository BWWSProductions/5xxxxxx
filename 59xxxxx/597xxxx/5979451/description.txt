I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.
I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. 
Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. 
Surely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.

The Guitar of Preston Reed

Expanding the Realm of Acoustic Playing

HomeSpun video
Type: AVI


This is an instructional video derived from a VHS copy... but the image and sound quality are more than sufficient to enjoy this revolutionary approach to the guitar as a percussive instrument...

Preston Reed has reinvented how the acoustic guitar is played with his dynamic use of percussive devices and unusual playing ideas. You'll learn to create a multitude of sonic and rhythmic effects with Preston's "rim shots," "bongo hits," slap harmonics, double hammer-ons, two-hand tapping, right-hand fretting and other techniques. In "Slap Funk," "Border Towns" and "Tribes," he shows new ways of generating sounds and offers a myriad of ideas for this exciting solo guitar style.
