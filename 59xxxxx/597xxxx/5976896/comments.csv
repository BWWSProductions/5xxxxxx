lol thx mate this is kind from you .
I meant that THIS IS ARTISTEER VERSION 3 so last one out there but funny you say about me retiring as i shall move oud from my house soon and i learned today that the place where i ll go is ... omg ... it s a place where internet is even more slow than the one i have now ! i mean i upload AT MAX 100ko/s when i download at max 700ko/s and in my new house it seems like i ll be back on something like 30ko/s UP and download at max 100ko/s so a MISERY !  it s still a shock for me to know that so MY DAYS AS UPLOADER MIGHT BE OVER as i cannot upload stuff at such a ridiculous speed ... so funny but not really huh ? 

i am guted ! just because i love life ina countryside where i can plant my ganJAH and enjoy life outside , music very loud , BBQ and other stuff like that you know ? 

Man i appreciate very much your concern ... gosh ... like i m gonna have a modem at 56k ! 

 omg ... 56k can t be real ... ... as soon as i move out i ll try FIRST THING to upload a torrent and i will see if upload speed is enough as i dont download so much ... but still 56k is just a MISERYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY !

But honestly thx your comments help me to FIGHT FOR MY UPLOADERZ RIGHT lol . 

Take good care bredda Jah Protect and Bless tha man ."
,piyalsilva,2010-11-23T16:40Z,"tnx thousand times buddy. Very useful software for me. Worked and activated wll. However, when i try to open a previously saved themplate it doen't work. Only get the default default template. any idea for fix this?

Anyway, thanks a lot"
[V],DeGun,2010-11-23T20:44Z,"@@ PIYALSILVA : yea i heard about that recently so i guess you should try to save it on the vmware disk, and then just suspend it. 

OR ELSE : 

see there : http://www.artisteer.com/?post_id=142394&p=forum_post&forum_id=18  OR THERE http://www.artisteer.com/?post_id=147207&p=forum_post&forum_id=9 if you can find answers 

It seems that this is due to their new protection system against cracked pirated copies... hopefully you can get yourself sorted , if so PLZ COME BACK and LEAVE COMMENTS for people to find your solution

NB : TRY THIS : 

All YOU need to do is right click on the shortcut to launch the program, select properties, go to the compatibility tab, check the box for ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:"" and choose your 32 bit ""poison"". I chose ""Windows XP (Service Pack 3) and BINGO! The program will now save files with all the layout settings available and kept for you.

hope it works for ya LET US KNOW PLZ

,piyalsilva,2010-11-24T08:02Z,"unfortunately, that didn't work for me. sometimes may be the problem with my pc. that trick may work on other computer.  I am using windows 7 and tried all other compatible methods but still the problem exists. 

HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING IS BETTER THAN NOTHING. NOW WHAT I DO IS I  KEEP SOFTWARE WITHOUT CLOSING AND HIBERNATE COMPUTER UNTIL I COMPLETELY FINISH THE TEMPLATE. 
REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS AND REPLIES. THANKS AGAIN AND HAVE A NICE DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

,hex244,2010-12-01T06:46Z,"Yes, you may have activated it, but the activation does not allow you to save files and reload them, when you make a change to the artwork, save it then reload, it is not the same. I know because i have tried to do it on many ocasions.

There is more to the activation process, than just entering the code.

If you can prove the save and reload with a designedï»¿ template then you may get some credit."

,Enque,2010-12-13T11:24Z,"Solved The 'Not Saving and Re-opening' Issue.

Hello guys, I am so happy that i couldn't wait till later to write a comment, now i'm writing using my mobile. So bare with me if u see some misspelled words or very short words. Anyways, i've been using Artiseer for the last couple of weeks and i couldn't open the templates i saved. When it opens it opens the default page not the template i saved. So i used to use my laptop and hibernate it. It kind of sucked and i have to shutdown my computer at some point. Anyways, today i found a method to Re-open those files. Let me go straight to the point.
First create a new Administrator User account. 
Switch user and go to the newly created user account. On that account open, Artiseer. 
Now, It will ask you for a license key to activate it even though i activated it on my older user account. So using the key-gen you downloaded from this site, Activate the application. After that, it just works fine. Simple as That. I have tried these thing on three computers (2 windows 7, 1 Xp) and it worked like a charm. Try it out and tell me how it goes. I didn't get time to test whether it would work if the user account i created is not Administrator or what would happen if i opened artiseer on my old user account. So follow the same steps i did, and tell me how it goes. So to Summarize;

Steps (1-3 are for those people who haven't installed or tried Artisteer)

1. Install Artiseer (If you haven't already )
2. Activate it using the Key-gen.
3. Do what ever you do and save your template and try to re-open it. (It doesn't Re-open)

4. Now go to Control Panel --> Users, Then create a new Administrator User account.
5. Switch user and go to that User account. 
6. Open Artiseer. (It will ask you to re-activate it)
7. Do that by doing the same thing you did to activate it (like Step number 2)
8. When you activate it, it will work. 

This is my first time posting, so please tell me how it goes. "

,ZoltAi,2010-12-28T13:46Z,"none of above worked for me :( it's really sad there's still no solution 

however what I did and it worked I installed version 2 of artisteer and when I create template I do it in 2 then save it and open in 3 and it works ... that mean that I still have to change few things (cause in 2 there are some options from 3 missing) but at least I don't have to do it from scratch ...

take care and waiting for vitamin for art3"
,orloxnew,2010-12-31T13:55Z,"What I did that fixed the problem.
Logged in to another administrative account.
Run artisteer install from that account at windows xp service pack 2 compability mode.
Run the artisteer, put the keys.
Run it once.
Log of the account.
Log in with normal account.
Run it again and it worked normaly."
,riteonman2001,2011-01-04T20:52Z,Great upload. works fine on XP Home 32-bit. 
,shyspy,2011-01-11T18:56Z,"An awesome share..
+1000 for the share.. really awesome.. works classic on win xp sp3

And secondly i added it to no net access list of my firewall so that no shit updates or lisence detection happens..

Thanks for the share.. keep it up !!"

Too bad the saving/loading isnt working yet, but that's not the torrent, thats artisteer itself. I dunno if it has been fixed, but when it does, can you please upload that version then? thanks alot! :)"
,chaoticmel,2011-02-15T05:26Z,"Tried dling and after opening the torrent and installing, there was no key gen that I found:("

I right clicked shortcut and put it in compatibility more for windows xp sp2 and used option for all users. worked, will now save all changes. woo hoo"
,blackmejl,2011-03-06T09:10Z,"Now, when I try to download from artisteer site, it says it is 2.6.0.36391.exe file.
What is that? did they stop version 3?"
,blackmejl,2011-03-06T22:33Z,"... and nope, i still can't save, no matter what I try.
This version 2.6 that can be downloaded from their official site DOES WORK WITH KEYGEN FROM THIS TORRENT, but it also do not save. And it is very different from this one here, much less options, so do not bother doing it.

Now this one is very usefull, but there is just too much to do building a template, that cant b done at once, so, a save option is a must. 
And nowhere to find solution. I will try installing on a xp 32bit tomorrow to see if it helps. On Win 7 x64 just is not working! (save option, but software is working fine) Since there is no fully working version on net, this is as good as it gets at this point.

And one more time: whats with 2.6 version they offer on-site? Is this one (v.3) from this torrent a beta or something? "
,deathlyoller,2011-03-09T14:25Z,Tried every solution given above but none helped...anyways thanks for this torrent. It is great!!! Hope that a solution for the save problem will be found soon.  I am doing my best to find one...:)
,bobtheiphonenob,2011-03-14T06:58Z,"I've tried with the other torrents even changing the other Loader.exe file to search for this version etc, still doesn't work...  Also tried the other crack and save fix WITH this keygen... stilll doesn't work, but surely a combination of crack and this keygen must work, changing the license.reg
If you use that blocker on the other torrent it will block ALL outgoing to even the Artisteer website, which is a pain in the arse for you, better to just block all using windows firewall advanced settings....  
@DeGun  I will keep trying, thanks for the up!   And if your connection is crap in your new place try using usb dongle, I used to get 7.2mbps only limitation been I had to upload and download after 12am!"

by Bout2Bus

You guys are gonna love how easy this is!

OK. So youve downloaded and activated your chosen version of Artisteer.
BUT, guess what? IT WONT SAVE YOUR PROJECTS!!!
Youre not alone, trust me.

How to get around this:

When you open Artisteer you are faced with that dreaded default layout.
Dont even bother working on it!
Instead choose 'Open' and browse to C:\Program Files\Artisteer 3\Library\Data\Samples (XP example)
Open one of these and get creative!
Save project by simply clicking the 'Save' icon. And it WILL BE SAVED! Reopen it and you'll see!"

,loconz,2011-03-20T03:01Z,I gave up and purchased it. It was worth it...
,thegje,2011-03-21T19:54Z,"i decided to buy v2.6, but was blocked from artisteer website, downloaded onto external HD through other computer and activated through purchase ~ÃÂ£82.   Ran from external HD on main computer and had the same save and reload issue of not changing layout etc so tried to install on main computer using exactly the same keys but said invalid keys? so realised install location wasnt the issue, neither was save location, it had to be the operating system location i.e. HD serial, so I guessed it checks your HD serial against licence key/install code (like i think solidworks does as well maybe?) so I downloaded HD changer and got the serial of the other laptop and changed my main laptops HD to that, and now it works :-)  Will test on a few more computers to see it works. But if this is the case, then maybe I can use the install codes I got with that purchase with my new HD serial and see if It can properly activate v3.0    

So basically-
Artisteer checks your HD serial against the install keys (i think)
Anyone who has it working with v3, can you post your HD serial, if we change ours to that, then it should work :-)

but thegje may be nerer the point, but how do you change your HD serial number? "
,alfuk,2011-03-24T11:19Z,"I have been one told me this would work have not tried yet

01. Uninstall any previous release of Artisteer.
02. Clean the registry with regedit : ""[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Extensoft\"", and delete a ""Extensoft"" key (whole ""folder"").
03. Run ""ViewVID.vbs"" to see the hard disk ID (must be: 8CC54BFB, if not this, use ""ChVID.exe"" to change).
04. Copy ""ChVID.exe"" to ""C:\"" (eg: ""C:\ChVID.exe"").
05. Run the console (CMD) as administrator.
06. Go to ""C:\"".
07. In the console type ""ChVID c: 8CC5-4BFB"" (without the quotes).
08. click ""Ok"" to all, until a message confirms the ID change.
09. Close the console and restart the computer.
10. Once the computer is booted again, use ""ViewVID.vbs"" to verify that your new ID is: 8CC54BFB.
11. Install ""Artisteer.3.0.0.32906.exe"" and follow the indications.
12. Let me finish the installation, do not run the program (Uncheck the ""Run the program) and click ""Finish"".
13. With Windows FireWall select ""...\Artisteer 3\bin\Artisteer.exe"" and LOCK IT so it can not access the internet (this step is essential) - If you dont know to lock it by firewall, try to disconnet your internet connection(unplug cable) and you see that will work
14. Now, run the file ""Artists 3 lic.reg"" and accept the warning window.
15. Ready, you can use Artisteer 3 and save templates modified!."
