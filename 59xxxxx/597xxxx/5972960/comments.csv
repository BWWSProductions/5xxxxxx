,Pzer0cool,2010-11-22T01:34Z,"Great copy  V9 A7

Video is awesome. Audio still sounds like it's from a cam, yet it's clear, but ""hollow"". Also, it's off sync at certain points, but only for a moment."

,ogdnp,2010-12-14T16:03Z,"Miguelius, is that you?"
,cainmosnimirrored,2010-12-17T09:59Z,"This copy is not bad at all. The video is great. The only problem is the audio, It is out of sync. The only way to get the audio to sync is to watch it on your computer with VLC media player. When the audio goes out of sync just hit pause for a few seconds and then play it, it will sync for about ten minutes so you will have to periodically pause and unpause to keep it in sync. This works. Hope I helped. If you really want to see this you will follow my advice."
,strytlr,2010-12-21T08:49Z,"U cock suckers......rating,criticizing and commenting the video.....atleast sm1 uploaded it for u scumbags.........u want some real shit than go spend some money......get a ticket  and watch it or buy the dvd urself.............wait for axxo to release a dvd rip for it "

,amsnrwb2010,2010-12-30T02:25Z,how do i seed?
,Recon117,2011-01-01T07:27Z,"@amsnrwb2010  When you download keep the torrent application going. Don't stop the file once it's downloaded, just keep the Utorrent/bitorrent w/e you use open when you can.

Most Torrent apps tell you your seed Ratio, you want to seed it to at least 2 people."
