[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-24T05:06Z,this video start out corrupted for you?  someone do an sha1sum of this video for me.
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-24T05:12Z,"could just be my copy is whack, starts out green in vlc, which means there is corruption somehow."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-24T05:14Z,"weird my Easy.A.2010.1080p.BluRay.x264-METiS is the same, corruption in beginning."
[V],aoloffline,2010-11-25T23:31Z,"Didn't noticed problems,but i only watch these releases on my PC with players that support core avc.. I never been a fan of VLC"
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-26T00:19Z,"yea, well my copies have some sort of corruption in the first few seconds. its not vlc related."
,scurvypirate1234,2010-11-26T01:30Z,"Plays fine on VLC, but not on my WDTV. Audio is a few seconds out of synch."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-26T02:27Z,im fetching it because no one has given me a straight answer.  my copy someone has cut like a few frames from the beginning and it doesn't start with a reference frame and it corrupts until an I frame shows up.
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-28T16:20Z,well that was a large waste of time :) exact same corruption.  wonder this didn't get nuked.
[T],qwersd,2010-12-20T15:42Z,i don't know if it's just me but i found the quality on this one poor.. will upload screens later..
[T],qwersd,2010-12-20T15:45Z,"in fact, my tv rejected this as being a corrupt file.."
