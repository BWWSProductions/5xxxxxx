,BuffDude,2010-11-21T19:51Z,"Thanks for uploading, but friends don't let friends do rar files. It makes the download a little smaller but doubles the size taken on a seeders hard drive."
,IamtheonlyDave,2010-11-21T20:24Z,Really bad download speed. Hardly any seeders?

,vapov,2010-11-23T01:12Z,"A:10 V:10.
This is the whole event including bonus fight at the end. 2h:47m:38s at 624x352 25fps Stereo off the ESPN HD feed. No idea what these other guys are talking about cutting off and prelims only.

IZArc unrar'd it fine. VLC played it perfect. Thx hiest."
,Aoshi101,2010-11-23T21:29Z,"When i try to unrar the files i get an error message.

Anyone else who has this problem too?"
,Choebee,2010-11-24T00:04Z,"I can open the rar files just fine, uncompressed I have an avi file that is 1.57gigs  lasting 1:53:42. The video for me cuts out right before Machida walks into the ring. 

 Anyone else having this problem? "
,SURLEWEB,2010-11-26T02:04Z,"No rars, please...it's a pain in the ass and video files are already compressed. Unless it's meant to include a virus."
