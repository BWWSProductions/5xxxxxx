Cleveland Jr. and Kendra, ashamed of how they look in swimsuits, feel left out of the fun when the family spends an afternoon at the pool. They decide to petition to pass a bill to grant equal rights to those who are overweight. Disgruntled by their defeat in the polls, the pair flees to Wisconsin, a land where they feel more free and accepted, and Cleveland and Lester vow to bring them back to where they belong.
