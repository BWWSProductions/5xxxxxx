
Dimitris Zervoudakis was born in Thessaloniki where he lives permanently. 
In 1985, while he is in Law school, he founds with other fellow students the group 'Neoi Epivates'. 
The success of the group opens the way in the discography soon with the release of an independent production titled "Shetika Paranomi" (Rather Illegal). Three years later Dimitris Zervoudakis has his first personal album "Acrobat" released, the correspondence is warm and the project classifies the new artist in a faculty of qualitative modern sound.
