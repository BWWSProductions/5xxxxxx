From the
bestselling author of The Little Red Book of Selling...Every business winner has one thing in common: a YES! attitude
that's powerful enough to help them achieve the impossible! When you've got a YES! attitude, you assume everything will
start with "YES!"...and you'll find a way to "YES!" even when the first, second, and third answer you hear is
"NO!"...
