,hauntnut,2011-05-10T05:35Z,Audio goes way out of sync at 1hr 21min mark. 
,dpx,2011-08-22T23:39Z,"Hauntnut is correct, you'll need to re-sync audio (if you're using a player like VLC) at the 1hr 20min mark.  

Also there are black bars around the frame that have been encoded into the video. 

Given that its hard to find this online, you might have to download this and make it work. "
