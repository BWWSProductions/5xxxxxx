[T],RedHatcc,2010-11-22T18:54Z,"I have used these before, but none that was quite this simple to do. Thought I should share, although its simple in theory, very small download, I think some people are not sure how to use it lol seeing that there are a few -'s up there. 

You open the .torrent file, set your upload speed to something like 50000000, wait a few seconds after you click start and click stop. Your ratio will be sky high. 

I can make a youtube video if someone has a problem using it. 

But thank you for the review :)"
,neil22768,2010-11-22T20:18Z,"hi thankyou so much RedHatcc i was having trouble keeping my ratio up on another torrent site i was 60gig more downloaded than uploaded so was going to get banned 

but then along comes you with this torrent and saves my life in a few seconds im now 300gig more upload than download no more ratio problems for me rofl

again thanks one of the best torrents ive ever downloaded and i WILL SEED THIS ONE LOL :)"
,neil22768,2010-11-22T21:26Z,"guys stop giving this minus scores untill you know what its suppossed to do

right if you use another torrent site that requires you to seed torrents to keep your ratio at 1.00 or they ban you from that site then this it what this program is for it tricks your torrent site into thinking your uploading when actually your not

so as i said previous my ratio was 0.89 on the other site i use so if i could not seed anough torrents to get my ratio to 1.00 i would of been banned from that site but this program tricked the site into thinking i seeded 300gigs of data so my ratio is no sky high i dont have to worry about seedind torrents to keep my ratio good

its a fantastic programm if you know anything about torrents 

maybe this will help you understand what it is

once again THANKYOU REDHATCC"

,rogamosh,2010-11-28T19:30Z,Thank U So Much Bro.....U Saved My Demonoid Account.....
,thirteen37,2010-11-28T21:06Z,"WORKS PERFECT! Thank you Red Hat. 
the -10 are just the people not smart enough to read the comments to figure out how to work it.

Thanks again."
[T],RedHatcc,2010-12-13T12:51Z,"lol yep.. 

I know for a fact it works with demonoid, bitsoup, and a couple other very popular ones. But since they all are using the same proto, theres a 99% sucess rate.
