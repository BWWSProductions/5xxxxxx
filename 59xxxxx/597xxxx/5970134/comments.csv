,cloie74,2010-11-26T19:53Z,"You have to have a modded Wii either a soft mod or a wiikii type mod, and Homebrew. then you need Win Rar to make all the little files into a big ISO File from there you can either use IMGBurn to burn the ISO to disk or you can use WBFS manager to put it on a USB device and play from there. Google is your friend, use it! "
