Undercover Agent Malcolm Turner is back and this time he's out to expose the
suspected designer of a deadly computer "worm" that would allow outside forces
access to sophistical and critical government intelligence files. But unfortunately,
the only way the crafty agent can get next to the worm's creator, Tom Fuller, is
to access the programmer's Orange County home as the new "nanny" to Fuller and his
wife Leah's children: toddler Andrew and his two older sisters, Carrie and Molly.
This means that Malcolm must once again rely on his sure-fire alter ego, the
take-no-prisoners Hattie Mae Pierce, a.k.a. "Big Momma," to bring down the bad guys
and prove that a woman's work is never done! But once undercover, the job proves
another tough juggling act for Big Momma as "she" must manage the hectic lives of
the three Fuller kids, keep up with their myriad of daily activities, and handle
the many household chores...
