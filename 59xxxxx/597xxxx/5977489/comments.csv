,FucHollywood,2010-11-28T08:46Z,Try Cookies Xbox360 Game burner works every time & never burn faster than 4X the slower the better.
,Wishingwell12,2010-11-28T18:00Z,"Ok everyone,  this is what to do for those of you having problems with this iso.  Yes it does not burn straight to Image Burn or Cookies Xbox 360.  What you need to do is make a copy of the iso image on your desktop.  Then you can add it from your desktop to your Image Burner or Cookies Xbox 360.  It will then burn in your Image Burner or Cookies Xbox 360.  Hope this helps end the confusion.  It does work/play this way.   "
,beerswagger2007,2010-11-30T18:38Z,bullshit.....i extracted the files with winrar...then i burned it with img burn at 2.4 speed and guess what im playing it right now ...so dont say it dont burn with img burn cuz your all full of shit

,vlike2party,2010-12-08T20:28Z,"I think this is a bad dup, cause I stuck in loading for a long while in the second fight.. I try to install the game inside the harddrive and it passed that stage .. but play and continue sometimes it frozen..
I downloaded another one from other site no such problem.. anyone has the same problem"
,knight90,2011-01-12T02:03Z,for some reason when i was extracting it said the iso file is broken did i do something wrong
