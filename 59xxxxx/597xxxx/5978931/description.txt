Venue: Thunderdome

Recording: AUD
Quality: 8(-)
Menu: NO

Comments: Single cam stage left. Nice and steady and fairly well-shot. A few shakes, a few onstructions and the odd shot of the screen. Picture quality is a bit blurry Audio is a bit uneven at first and then it's gets very distant and tinny with plenty of audience hooting.
