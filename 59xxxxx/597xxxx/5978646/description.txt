Release notes:

The Black Eyed Peas' sixth album, The Beginning is the follow-up to the group's
blockbuster album The E.N.D. Released in June 2009, The E.N.D. has sold more
than 11 million copies worldwide, while spending 52 weeks on the Billboard Top
200 chart. It is also the first album in two decades by a duo or group to yield
five Top 10 songs on Billboard's Hot 100 chart, including the No. 1 hits "Boom
Boom Pow," "I Gotta Feeling" (which is the best-selling digital song in
SoundScan history), and "Imma Be," as well as the Top 10's "Meet Me Halfway" and
"Rock That Body." In addition, The E.N.D. was nominated for six 2010 Grammy
Awards and won for Best Pop Vocal Album, "Boom Boom Pow" won Best Short Form
Music Video and "I Gotta Feeling" won for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or
Group.

While the title of The E.N.D. was a play on words (standing for "The Energy
Never Dies"), the new album's title, The Beginning, "refers to what is actually
happening in the world right now," says will.i.am. "The Beginning is symbolic of
adopting new technologies, such as augmented reality, 3D, and 360 video. It's
also about being experimental and taking songs we've liked from the past and
playing around with sick, crazy beats."

In keeping with that manifesto, the first single from The Beginning is "The Time
(Dirty Bit)," which is built around a sample from the classic 1987 theme from
Dirty Dancing, ("I've Had) The Time of My Life," recorded by Bill Medley and
Jennifer Warnes. "The song is a celebration of this amazing time in our lives,"
says vocalist Fergie. "We've been on tour all over the world, and looking out at
stadiums full of people who came out to see us -- that's as big as it gets.
After the shows, we go out to the clubs and meet the fans; those are moments
that we have to remember." "Plus the fact that we get to experience it with each
other," adds vocalist apl.de.ap, "that's the best feeling ever."

"You never know what's going to happen, so you want to make the best of every
day," says will.i.am. "We wanted to capture that feeling and release a song that
celebrates with the fans because it wouldn't have happened without them." This
album is the beginning of a new era of Pea world domination -- fasten your seat
belts pea-ple enjoy the ride, declares Taboo.

The Black Eyed Peas have shot a video for "The Time (Dirty Bit)," with director
Rich Lee, who also lensed the Peas' "Imma Be Rocking That Body" video, as well
as clips for Eminem ("Not Afraid"), The All-American Rejects ("The Wind Blows"),
Fergie ("Clumsy"), and the Pussycat Dolls ("Hush Hush").

The Beginning will be released in several physical formats - a standard CD, a
deluxe CD that includes 3 bonus songs, a full album vinyl and a combo two-disc
set of 20 songs that includes The Beginning & The Best of THE E.N.D..

The E.N.D. was The Black Eyed Peas first original music since 2005's Monkey
Business, which was certified triple platinum in the U.S., with worldwide sales
of more than nine million. Monkey Business generated Grammy Awards over two
consecutive years, for "Don't Phunk with My Heart" and "My Humps." The Peas'
first Grammy Award came six years ago, for "Let's Get It Started," from their
breakthrough 2003 album Elephunk, which introduced Fergie into the lineup, and
transformed the group into international superstars with cumulative 25x platinum
sales in nearly a dozen countries around the world. In 2006, Fergie released her
six-million-selling solo debut The Dutchess and 2007 Producer of the Year
Grammy-nominee will.i.am released Songs About Girls. Since forming in 1995, The
Black Eyed Peas have sold more than 28 million albums worldwide and more than
30.8 million digital tracks. In addition, they have logged more than 300
headline tour dates in 29 countries with more than 2.2 million tickets sold. The
group has been nominated for a 2010 American Music Award in the Favorite Band,
Duo or Group category.
