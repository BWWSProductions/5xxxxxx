Post any problems here and I will try to get back with you asap for the next couple days. Enjoy!"

,nicoya,2010-12-12T07:47Z,"**Just a heads upp**

I was getting a Photoshop CS5 Aplication error (0xc000001d) when trying to open Photoshop CS5 because i have an older Athlon XP processors with Win 7.

But Adobe had a patch to fix this problem so that means you have to update to newer version so it may ask for a serial.

So what i did was i install patch/upgrade and use one of those serials from above. 

So now im happy that i got it running:)

Here is the link on Adobe forums if you run into problems with older Athlon XP processors.

Thanks You RedHatcc for great Upload."

,P4LMER,2010-12-20T02:49Z,No 3D? Or did I do something wrong. If theres a way to add the 3D feature please somebody tell me.
,ancientmarinerstc,2010-12-20T16:46Z,"Can someone help?
I followed all the instructions but keep getting:
application failed to start: missing amtlib.dll.

I replaced four: did I miss something?"
,nifty999,2011-01-07T10:54Z,"Hi I downloaded this and unpacked it. Followed instructions re host file.

Now instructions say to install the program but I can find an exe or similar file anywhere to begin the process. Any help much appreciated!"
,impuls3,2011-01-10T06:49Z,"Thanks Red, works like a charm"
,dearghoul,2011-01-11T11:22Z,"Haven't actually run it yet, but it installed without a hitch. I think I'm good to go. I had to try two serials, but the 2nd in the list worked. 
Thank you a BUNCH, nicest crack I've seen in a while!"
,dearghoul,2011-01-11T11:33Z,"Yes, she works!
People! Find and disable the automatic updater, I don't know about this one, but my old versions would try to update, and adobe would send a nice package which killed my ever-so-pirated copy, permanently!!! Had to reinstall windows to overcome this.
I just renamed every .exe file in the folder containing the updater to disable it. 
I like to just stick a big ""KILLED"" on the end, so it's easy to find if I need it later for some reason. 
This folder lives at:
c:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\OOBE\PDApp\UWA
"
,dearghoul,2011-01-11T11:37Z,"PS, beware of any other adobe installs you do, they could/will overwrite your updater even though it's another product. I'm pretty sure adobe uses one updater for all their stuff. Flash, reader, etc. could undo you here! "
,dearghoul,2011-01-11T11:57Z,"Sorry to keep yacking. 
If I'm wrong, and this is not vulnerable to adobe's updates undoing it, ignore my spiel. I was just looking over at a premiere pro torrent which seems to be able to safely update and everything, so maybe this can too. 
Would the OP care to let us know?
Thanks!"

,Lewy_H,2012-03-16T20:38Z,"This torrent definitely works but I encountered a problem along the way that the instructions didn't fix. At the time of download, the website with the instructions wasn't online anymore but there is an instructions file within the Crack folder. 

I had just finished a trial version of Photoshop CS5.5 and uninstalled it so this still works if you were in my position.

The error I had was ""The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b)"". This happened after I had installed the program and tried to run it. The problem is with the amtlib.dll, the instructions given work fine for 32bit installs, but I chose to install only the 64bit version. 
"
,Lewy_H,2012-03-16T20:40Z,"^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The problem was that you shouldn't copy over the amtlib.dll which will be in the Program Files>Adobe folder because it is the 32bit file and isn't needed for 64bit. "
,windwip,2012-03-28T05:02Z,I downloaded CS5 awhile back (not sure if it was your torrent or not) and I had to tweak some information in a file which prevented adobe from updating. Now flash has a new version and I can't update to it - any idea what I can do? Thanks - and thanks a ton for the torrent!
