[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-28T16:23Z,"it is corrupt, just like metis 720p and 1080p of the other guys.  wont bother 99.99% of people though as it only effects the first 3 seconds or so of film."
,scurvypirate1234,2010-11-29T06:02Z,@wireless38 - I'm getting the same problem. Audio is out of sync throughout the whole movie when played on a WDTV.
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-29T22:43Z,"its likely due to the corruption at the beginning of the film.  there is an encoder error here, like the front part of the film got whacked off by a few frames."
