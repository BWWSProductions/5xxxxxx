Now that John Stewart has gone and left us, and Tom Waits seems to have all but disappeared (well he hasnâ€™t really as heâ€™s about to undertake an European tour), Eaglesmith is poised to pick up the mantle of the gruff man of Americana.

When you name an album â€˜Tinderboxâ€™ then maybe youâ€™re looking to start some sort of blaze. But whilst this album doesnâ€™t exactly burn in its fiery delivery itâ€™s certainly intense. 

Eaglesmith has been around for ages; always bubbling under as the next big thing, but in reality merely a cult, with his dedicated followers. Much like Waits and Stewart then.

As with those guys the message is in the lyrics. The music seems to merely accompany what heâ€™s saying, whereas other artists try to hide their thoughts behind a wall of sound, Eaglesmith does the opposite. You can imagine these lyrics with different musical genres accompanying them and theyâ€™d still work. 

Thereâ€™s a lot of laments for poor souls here. â€˜Get On Your Kneesâ€™ outlines how the narrator has come to save souls from Satan and â€˜Fancy Godâ€™ states â€œThat God you got is a fancy God and heâ€™s not one I knowâ€. Yikes, that should get the bible belt up in arms. â€˜Killing Meâ€™ sums up the trials and tribulations of day to day life; â€œUp on the high ground, down on my knees, this old world is killing me. Gotta have rain if you want to plant seed.â€ 

And not forgetting the shysters and swindlers who are also after your soul, which drug dealers are of course. â€˜You Canâ€™t Trust Themâ€™ advises amphetamine buyers to â€œCount your fingers, when you shake their hand cause they steal your wealth as fast as they canâ€ and insists â€œBells softly ring beneath their steeple, theyâ€™re selling souls and theyâ€™re dealing people.â€ 

Eaglesmith captures loads of eccentricities in his musings and also manages to deceive the listener with music that shouldnâ€™t â€˜matchâ€™ the words. â€˜I Pray Nowâ€™ uses the working chain gang spiritual chants so beloved of film directors, whereas â€˜Chain Gangâ€™ doesnâ€™t. See what he did there. Clever ainâ€™t he? And he does the same on other tracks when he brings in the alt-country, gospel and folk blues.

Eighteen songs and not one â€˜happyâ€™ one amongst them. But there are plenty of songs of hope and thatâ€™s as it should be.
