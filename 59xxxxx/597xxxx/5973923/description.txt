This is a template for subtitles to any language from an English template
for the bluray convert version of "The Remains of the Day" 2hrs 12mins 42 seconds
program version. We got it from a matroska file and ran a spell check through.

We suggest you download the very competent "subtitles editor program" offered
by a Danish author on the net for "free" (donations supprted).


In just a little time invested for your community, you might b able to offer
a subtitles file for all to share that speak your native language.

If you have a competent grasp of the English language, and are as well fluent
in some other languages too, here is a great chance to provide something many
people need to learn from what great lessons there are in this movie.

We hope you will serve the cause in the spirit of being community minded with our
collective efforts here.


Merci and danke equally!


with thanks!
