Special thanks to 2naFish for the original upload this was made from.

For the video, I cropped all the black out and made this a pure 16:9 file so that it will play full screen on widescreen monitors. I applied a slight noise reduction too, and de-interlaced with a special sharpening process I use personally.

Video as is in the screen shot. No cropping done to the screen shot above.

For the audio, it was completely replaced with explicit CD audio, encoded to the following specs:

Video = 16:9 NTSC 29.97 fps MPEG-2

Audio = 224 kbps .ac3 @ 48 KHz

File is ready for DVD Authoring as is.

Enjoy! And please seed!
