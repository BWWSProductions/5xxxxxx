That is, on every scene change, the left eye shows the current scene image and the right eye shows the next scene image.  It causes disturbing flashes at each scene change.  I am not sure if this is normal for 3D content??"

,BlueOpal,2011-06-20T15:33Z,How do I get subtitles to work on this movie? Tried Stereoscopic Player which didn't show subs at all and same with VLC. Windows mediaplayer showed them after installing CCCP codek pack but it's in the middle of the screen (starts in left corner of left pic and ends in right corner of right pic) so won't show correctly in 3D.
