
HOW TO DATE AN OTAKU GIRL (2010)




It was love at first sight when Hinata (Daito Shunsuke) spots former co-worker Yoriko (Matsumoto Wakana). Head over heels in love, Hinata confesses his love to Yoriko, but she warns him that she's a fujoshi - a term Hinata has never heard of. Ignoring her warning, the two begin dating, and Hinata suddenly finds himself knee-deep in butler costumes, boys love comics, and cosplay parties. Can Hinata see past Yoriko's strange hobbies and love her for who she is?
