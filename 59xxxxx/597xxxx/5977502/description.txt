Tanx is the eighth album byrock band T. Rex, released in 1973. Tanx
was a hit in UK and Europe but it failed to emulate the success of The Slider in
the U.S., reaching only #102 in the album charts. It was critically derided by
journalists[citation needed] who said the darker, adult sound was a complete
departure from the unique melodic rock and roll that made the band famous.

It predates punk in some ways, with largely darker and more aggressive songs,
and shorter songs than the previous two T. Rex albums ["Electric Warrior" and
"The Slider"] with 9 of the songs less than three minutes long [by comparison,
"Get It On" was 4:24], akin to Bolan's previous albums under the name
Tyrannosaurus Rex and the debut album under the abbreviated "T. Rex" name
[all of which had no more than 2 songs over three minutes per album]. "Tanx" is
also the first album notably to incorporate elements of soul music, further
explored in the following album, "Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of
Tomorrow", and other subsequent T. Rex albums. Likewise, it's the beginning of
Bolan's marked departure from the glam rock style which he originated and
helped popularize, preceding contemporary David Bowie's departure from glam
and move towards soul music with his album, "Young Americans", by nearly 2
years
