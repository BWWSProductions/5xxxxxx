ADOBE AFTER EFFECTS PLUGINS

DigiEffects CameraMapper.

Create multi-plane images with 3D parallax from any still image or project
your image onto solids rotated in 3D space to create 3 dimensional objects
that move realistically when camera moves are used. The possibilities are
endless. Now instead of a video camera, all you need is a still image and
some imagination

Key Features:
* Realistically create the illusion that a still image is fully dimensional
  moving footage
* Subtly change the perspective of a shot, or animate it over time
* Can be combined with 3D tracking to add or alter elements in a scene
* Now you can step back in time and get another chance to move the camera
* Allows you to stay in After Effects when working with fully dimensional
  models
