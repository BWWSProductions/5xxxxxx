Cyber City OEDO 808 File 2 - Psychic Trooper (The Decoy Program) - AUDIO=Rory McFarlane/ENG/JAP

Anyway this is part of the Cyberpunk Collection, the Cyber City series, I will upload the last one next week, there are 3 in total.

What I've done with these is added the McFarlane audio track of the original video tape (can't tell audio is very clear using a nicam akai vcr and LG Standalone DVD Recorder) and also left the original English and Japanese soundtrack intact, there are no menu's just manga.

Reason for doing this is because the original McFarlane soundtrack herd on UK's Channel 4 in 1995 sounded awesome and is probably never gonna be available on DVD. Hope you enjoy.
