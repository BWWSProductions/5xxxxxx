[T],verifire,2010-11-25T01:20Z,"@ shailu212: Well, would you believe me if I told you about how CIA contacted W. Disney to help them brainwash us into accepting satanic signing and messages through very short, one-frame, or ""subliminal"" messaging, signs already in 1940? Cartoons were the greatest media for reaching a big audience, especially children..

Since then, we've seen a distinct tendency on nearly every media arena.. Haven't you noticed?

If not; hit that download-button..

Then ask yourself: What does these things have in common, and why implant so heavily just these things in our minds? What do they want to accomplish?

[Food for thought, just an example: In 1941, ""Pinocchio"" was released on theaters, and in it, when the fox spots Pinocchio walking to school without any strings attached, he explains to his companion how they would have made it big if they sold him to the puppeteer, Stromboli. Seen the movie?

As the fox explains this, he is pointing his index finger down into his palm, for then to raise his hand and show the sign of recognition between Luciferians. The Satanic ""El Cornuto"", ""The Horned One"". Why? In a children's cartoon in 1941?

I stumbled across it while watching the movie some years ago, but suddenly I saw it.

I backplayed and took screenshots of every frame, and sure enough..

Why would a outstanding mason like Disney do that, you may ask?

""Good, Clean Family Entertainment You Can Trust""..

Yeah.."
