,james bond freak,2010-11-24T17:30Z,"@77jboy.

It's called Joe's adventures. Not Jimmy's vendatta.
So it includes Joe's adventures. Not Jimmy's vendetta.


I know, it's weird..."

,skinny_gorilla,2010-11-28T05:51Z,"Good one SKIDROW, works like a charm - like always!

If anyone has any problems thats what I did and u should do so, as well:

1. Install the full game,
2. Use Crack fix,
3. Update,
4. Install Joe's Adventures,
5. Use Crack fix again(just in case),
6. Play the game...

Simple as that...Good luck to all and thanks again. Will have some good fun for the next couple of days."

,amfefe925,2010-12-11T07:52Z,hi guys! ive dowbloaded this and the full game.. when i try to play the game it stuck on the loading screen? any hellp please?
,fuzzilla,2010-12-18T11:40Z,"It worked fine, but not anymore. After the shootout in the whorehouse the game crashes. I can see the video but after that, game crashes. Maybe I'll try to re-install or something..."
,Qeunoxe,2010-12-20T02:24Z,"The download works perfectly..!

But guys.. 

But i have a personal problem with this DLC which you people probably also wouln't like.
The DLC starts off great!.. but then it all goes back to jimmy's vendetta ,.. boring, no cutscenes,almost no narrative context,.. Reading your missions,.......which means ..BORING.. such a waist.. Mafia II was a awesome game.. infact, probably one of the best games i have ever played!.. Mafia 1 is still my favorite game ever and Mafia II is a perfect sequal.. it it looks like the 2k czech did spend a lot of attention to this DLC.

Too bad.. :("
,djplaztiqbag,2010-12-27T08:32Z,i've tried re-installing etc but no luck. i downloaded a random binkw32.dll file and copied that into my system folder but that didn't work either. Probably because it's not the right one for the game. Could someone please send me a copy of their 'binkw32.dll' file for Mafia2?? my email is ty_rite2me@hotmail.com . it would be a last resort and a real help. thanks!

,Piddyx,2011-01-12T06:23Z,"i installed the game,but it loads endlessly.  I know other people have this issue.  I think the problem is that we need the update."
,Piddyx,2011-01-12T06:29Z,"Update 1:

There are other updates, but I do not think they are real.

,Stan844,2011-01-20T16:49Z,Will this still work if my mafia 2 is through steam?
,Banzay27,2011-01-28T02:21Z,"'fuck is this shit?

This DLC starts you off well with proper filler content as you play with Joe, starting the moment Vito is arrested. After the beginning to, you only get fed junk filler ""arcade"" missions, with the occasional ""story"" mission in between. Hell, this whole game is built upon storyline, it doesn't float otherwise.
They were smoking something bad when they decided on the idea to make the DLCs this way. Or, more likely, aiming at easy money.

From Illusions Softworks to 2K Games... to hell with this."
