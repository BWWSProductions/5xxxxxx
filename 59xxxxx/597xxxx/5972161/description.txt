                                Drive-in Double Feature 01

   This is My first attempt at this, but it turned out pretty well. I learn quick and they will get better.

Tonight we have the legendary Double Feature "I drink your blood" and "I eat your skin".

It starts with "now playing", Trailers for this set. Then "coming attractions", Trailers for the next one I have in mind.

Then feature number 1 "I drink your blood".

Intermission with a countdown clock. Now you don't have to stop the DVD to refresh your drink, get some food.
Or just skip it and go to;

Feature number 2 "I eat your skin".

Then a goodbye message.

I hope You enjoy this Drive-in Experience.
