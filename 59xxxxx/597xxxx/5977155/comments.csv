,Sindollx666x,2010-11-23T08:21Z,"Downloading now, will comment on quality once I watch. Also will seed for sometime if quality is worth downloading. I have already seen this in the theater so I am looking for a decent version just to watch again. "
,mccheap,2010-11-23T10:05Z,"This is the same camera version, very low quality."
,Rohan151,2010-11-23T10:32Z,"@mccheap - I'm guessing that many people will know without you telling them that it's a cam version. Why? Through the miracle of their being the letters C, A and M in nice, shiny capital letters sticking together on their own somewhere in the torrent's name.

Duh."
,Sindollx666x,2010-11-23T12:21Z,"First 37 minutes were good quality, besides the WB logo in the middle of the screen that was slightly visible through it- but more visible in darker scenes.

The rest of the movie was blurry, dark, and the audio was a bit off at times.

NOT RECOMMENDED IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT IN THE THEATER YET. 

Other than that it was watchable if you have seen it in theaters and just really need to watch it again. However there is this annoying blurred spot on the lower right hand of the screen that looks like some sort of clock or counter. "

,raul4ever,2010-11-23T19:51Z,whats the point of uploading the same blurry cam again??
,Green-Banana,2010-11-23T22:45Z,"Absolutely unwatchable at least 1:30 in.  Really, we as the human race are capable of SO MUCH MORE than this.  "
,ronibob,2010-11-23T23:38Z,what a load of winghers its free you idiots so why complain if its not perfect just delete it if its no good and wait for a better copy instead of being childish and pulling the uploader down. people who complain about free stuff are jusy mourngy!!
,GAVB,2010-11-23T23:49Z,Wow somebody has a lot of memory on there 1.5 mega pixel camera phone!
,keith23uk,2010-11-24T00:00Z,"The movie I am still waiting for is ""Let Me In"" Anyone seen it or can contact the source providers?"
,musicman1105,2010-11-24T01:20Z,Seems fine to me for a cam. Thank you miguel1983.
,DuskRose666ss,2010-11-24T03:23Z,ive seen better cams this one has some really dark spots currently downloading a diff copy hoping to be better than this one altho if your really desperate this copy is watchable if you can get around the fact that some seens your bearly able to see then download this if not look for another copy but i do have to say the movie it self is freaking awsome 
,Snipess69,2010-11-24T03:24Z,is this like the other ones ive seen where at the 35min mark area of the movie for about 9mins it plays the audio from the sceane earlier in the movie wen vauldamort asks  for a wand it lasts untill the 44min mark
,dontuploadfake,2010-11-24T06:29Z,is is a very decent cam most of the torrents contaning more tha 700 megs are all bs fakes so dont bother ive tried almost all of them same bs download coral player to watch 
,mikeydada,2010-11-24T07:21Z,@snipess....no it is not.....it has a much better video.....audio is fine...but it is a  second or 2 out of sync sometimes....n u'll understand why if u look at bone's torrent with the description.......this is worth watching if u r 2 desperate n dun wanna w8 a week or 2
,highlander777,2010-11-24T11:28Z,"Thanks for the upload. This is the whole movie. The problem is about 1/3 of the movie is really dark and you can't see anything.

A: 5
V: 3
M: 7"
,highlander777,2010-11-24T11:44Z,"keith23uk,

Yeah, I'm waiting for ""Let Me In"" too!!! Seems it wasn't widely released. That's why there's no cam."
,virus.exe,2010-11-26T14:44Z,Wow best quality till now 10/10 thnx dude
,Mewable,2010-11-26T22:14Z,"Look, Basically This Is What's Gonna Happen! I Have NOT Downloaded This Film!! But I've Seen It At Cinema! .. Yeah If You Want A Decent Cam Your Going To Have To Wait About 1 -2 Weeks.. I Mean Im Going To Cinema Again Next Week To Watch This I've Got The Urge To Take A Tripod And A HD CamCorder And Friggin Record This Film In HD XD"
,ThE_UnKn0wN__,2010-11-27T01:54Z,"Best one out there:
V: 8 - (little bit dark)
A: 10 - everything is synced well.

Thanks for the upload!"
,Rampage9000,2010-11-27T05:25Z,"A6/V3
Audio is decent, with a bit of an echo.

Video is pretty unwatchable in most scenes.
Only if there is a lot of light can you actually make anything out. I've seen it in theaters, and even in medium light, you can hardly see anything.

The first and last sample picture in the description are from the cam. The other two are from the first 36 minutes that was leaked earlier. The two from the cam are probably the best pictures you could find in this. This one however does have proper audio sync when it switches over to the cam."
[T],Tiimb0,2010-11-27T19:04Z,"A: 5
V: 7 After 36 min V: 4
First 36 mins - Great quality! After that. it sucked"
,Kingx2000,2010-11-29T02:47Z,not to burst anyones bubble or anything but this wasn't filmed by miguel1983 if you go to filmous.com you'll find the exacly the same file from there web site all miguel had to do was buy it for  $.38 and just setup a torrent
,MEvsEVERYBODY,2010-11-29T12:31Z,"Those of you talking about ""Let Me In""...it's an english remake of the film ""Let the Right One In"" which is WAAAY better...I'd advise downloading that one first....

,fuji420,2010-11-30T03:05Z,What the fuck is up with the damn Warner Brothers watermark?? That certainly wasn't put on the theater screen so who would ruin an already poor quality vid even further by adding that? Jeez. . .
,martian_neighbour,2010-12-08T04:24Z,EVEN A DAMN CRAPPY CAM COPY HAS WATERMARK ON IT FUCK SHIT!!
,hr1989,2010-12-10T18:35Z,ass holllllllllll 1st 35min caler
