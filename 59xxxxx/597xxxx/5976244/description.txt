Check out this new Eminem track entitled "I Need A Doctor" which features Dr Dre. A new Alex Da Kid ('Love The Way You Lie') production. It's not clear yet if this collaboration comes from Dr Dre's upcoming album "Detox" or from Em' possible future re-release of "Recovery". In any case, this song is HOT!!! 

CD Quality. Enjoy.
