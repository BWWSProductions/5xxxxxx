This is a rough cut at best and whoever leaked it probably didn't have time to check the dB level on it. Either way this track will be dope as fuck when its all done. Also Alex Da Kidd said in an interview that it's on the Detox album, Dre came to him and asked him to produce it."

I hope Detox will bring some new ideas to the table. I've been waiting for this album since friggin high school. I completely forgot about it actually. From what I've read, it will be released this month, finally!"
