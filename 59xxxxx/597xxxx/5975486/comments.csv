leave out alcohol 120. Use Imgburn 2.5. This is free and has advanced features.

First you have to burn the files as 'ISO file' on a DVD. Then install the magicISO virtual Drive utility. This is free. This will show an icon on the system tray. Then insert the burned DVD on the drive. And right click on the system tray's icon, 'MagicISO Virtual CD/DVD Manager'. Go to Virtual CD/DVD Rom -> No Media -> Mount. Show the ISO files on the DVD drive. It guides you to a web browser (firefox). On the bottom of the browser click on 'Video Tutorials on this CD'. OK
