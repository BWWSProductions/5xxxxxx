This is AutoCad 2005 SP1 With 3 Tutorial CD's and one CD with extras for training.

When I started my job as a CNC operator I had to learn AutoCad. This set of tutorials got me up and running in no time. These Vid's are very helpful. The guy who teaches you is someone who actually uses AutoCad for a living, so he is very competent in his teaching. By the time you finish these tutorials, you will be able to start creating your work in AutoCad with relative ease.

Good luck, and enjoy.
