This is a new and improved version of the same torrent posted earlier. It has smaller file size but the same audio quality. This is the version you want."
,skeptoidfan,2010-11-20T16:25Z,A quick note: There are many more peers on this torrent than what appears from the seeders/leechers numbers on TPB.

Thank you for a very good question!

The answer is:

The lecturer acknowledges that many people may have various religious beliefs about the nature of life and death, immortality, sin, heaven and hell, based upon what they read from scripture or learn from their family. THAT IS NOT A SUBJECT OF THIS COURSE. 

The subject of the course is to examine what we can say about the topic of death, souls, immortality, morality, personal identity and so on WITHOUT resorting to arguments based upon traditional beliefs or ""divine revealed authority"". Religion is in other words NOT a subject of this course AT ALL. 

This is a philosophy course in the true sense of the word - based on unbiased thinking and reasoning and looking at difficult problems from multiple angles. 

What I really appreciate about this course is the way the lecturer works through the argument from both sides of an argument. And sometimes there are problems where we end up with arguments with more than two ""sides"" such as a body-view, a personality-view and soul-view - all of which are examined in great detail.

Be prepared for some serious thinking.

By the way, the professor lecturing is one of the most enthusiastic and clear spoken teachers I've ever heard, and luckily he also does have a good sense of humor.

I am not sure what you mean by ""similar"". I do not know any other with the exact same topic. You may find something of interest if you search Google or Youtube for the lecturers name ""Shelly Kagan"".

Anyway here is another excellent lecture that really gave me a deeper understanding the hows and whys of humans, our society and our universe. I highly recommend it.

,dsgjsd2,2011-01-12T21:42Z,Many thanks! Its a nice experience getting the illusion of attending a class at Yale when working with less inspired things at less inspired place.
,Atomic_n,2011-04-05T17:39Z,"This book/course is both slow and uninteresting to anyone with the slightest knowledge of philosophy in general.

However, it might be a decent introduction to people who haven't experienced philosophical arguments and their consequences.

Ohwell, good upload though.

@skeptoidfan, Read your tip about ""BIG HISTORY - The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity"" and checked it out. It's pretty sweet, haven't gotten so far into it though, but  so far it's great! Thanks."
