Due to the fact that Garmin Mobile XT does not support opening cards over 2 GB, the file was razdelen.Karta Ukraine carved and hand in a separate file.

Garmin supports opening files of 4 cards at once, but they should only have allowed the program name:

Gmapbmap.img - basemap, resolve issues with errors routing over long distances, as well as a route through a few cards
Gmapsupp.img - your map
Gmapsup2.img - your other card
