Have you tried to put the sd card in a cardreader on a laptop. Format the card - fat32. Make a folder called Garmin and put the file in there. Think it should work.

(I've tried to put the file in my gps via usb connected to the computer - it won't work - file to big.... )"
,irishhatty,2010-12-03T19:14Z,"the ""gmapsupp"" file is bigger than 2gb so most garmin devices will not open it even if saved on a 4gb card. can anybody chop this file to decrease its size to less than 2gb"

when it obviously is not ?"
