"The Fool Monty"

After learning that he is suffering from 
multiple illnesses and has only a few weeks 
to live, Mr. Burns becomes distraught by the 
town's less-than-sensitive reaction to his 
announcement. Following an unexpected turn 
of events, Bart finds Mr. Burns weak and 
vulnerable in the wilderness and secretly 
takes him into the Simpsons' home. But when 
Homer and Marge learn about their new 
houseguest, they decide it's payback time, 
and Lisa, determined to stand up for Mr. 
Burns, learns that old habits die hard.
