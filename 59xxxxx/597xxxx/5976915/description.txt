---->> 1. PHOTOSHOP TUTORiALS:                                       
    Ever wish you had Photoshop skills? Well.. i do. How did i learn?      
    I did tons and tons of 'Signature Tutorials'. I kept doing them.       
    Not many people are aware of the sophistication those little 'Sigs'    
    require and take to make. They are jam-packed with unknown, useful,    
    exotic techniques, tips, and a well oiled work flow.                   
                                                                           
    What's great about these tutorials is they are picture illustrated.    
    Authors take the time to show you step-by-step with 'Before' and       
    'After' screenshots. These are great for beginners or enthusiasts who  
    are looking to sharpen their skills.

---->> 3. SUiTCASE FUSiON 3 (Font Manager):                                
    You never want to install fonts directly onto your system. It will     
    affect Photoshop, Illustrator, and the overall performance of your     
    computer. This is why i use Suitcase among many other reasons !        
                                                                           
    Quick Highlights:                                                      
    - Easy to install fonts: just locate the directory and Suitcase will   
    search each folder/file, install fonts, while ignoring non-font files. 
    - Font Doctor: this will help repair corrupted fonts.                  
    - Preview: you can see what the fonts look like.                       
    - Auto-Activation: Suitcase will automatically activate fonts that     
    are needed by your system.                                             
    - Performance: this will greatly avoid performance problems for your   
    PC.                                                                    
    - Online Font Store: you can buy/rent fonts from the online store.

    NOTE: No duplicates! Unlike other people who do this to increase the   
    size of their pack. It's a pet-peeve of mine. I have downloaded 2GB    
    Design Packs, and half of it are duplicates that the uploader hides    
    in Sub-Directories and renames them so people don't know. Shame on     
    those people!

    Stay away from his uploads.. he is a shameless                         
    "Collector's Account" whore, constantly trying to rip people off !     
                                                                           
---->> 7. PHOTOSHOP PLUGiNS:                                               
    Plugins are vital for Graphics Designers. Plugins save designers tons  
    of time. Essentially plugins are shortcuts that do a variety of        
    Effects, Designs, and Enhancements that usually would take hours.      
                                                                           
    These are also handpicked from my collection that i use frequently.    
                                                                           
    Many people instal plugins just to install them. But too many plugins  
    will cause Photoshop poor performance. I am very selective.
