,Jimstalk,2010-11-23T22:14Z,As i previously said everything works perfect except from the plane with the g1000 (the Garmin digital displays..).When i load it the screens appear black.The battery switch and the avionics master swich are both turned on but the screens are still black and the buttons like the HDG indicator are not clickable.....any ideas????

,Skankzter,2011-03-28T17:42Z,"@bounce69 Because catshit1 is a complete prick.He like to to comment that uploads dont work when they do, or he likes to comment complete and utter shit basically.If you ever see his comments, do yourself a favor and ignore the sad troll."
