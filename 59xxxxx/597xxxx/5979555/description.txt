Window Theory (2004)

In Los Angeles, the twenty-five years old reckless wolf playboy Ethan Humphries lives in night-clubs scoring women supported by his parents, without working or studying. When his high-school friend Bradley accidentally tells him that his former best friend Jeff will get married in a couple of days, Ethan immediately travels to his hometown. He meets Brad, who is studying in the medical school, and the shy Sean, who is studying psychology, and recalls his glorious high school days, but his friends do not tell the name of the bride to him. While meeting Jeff in a bar in the night, Ethan finds that his fiancÃ©e is his former high-school sweetheart Stephanie. After meeting Stephanie, Ethan questions whether he is still in love with she, or only recalling a passion from his past.
