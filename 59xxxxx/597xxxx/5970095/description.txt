Freeway (1996)

Director: Matthew Bright

Freeway is a 1996 crime film written and directed by Matthew Bright, starring Kiefer Sutherland, Reese Witherspoon and Brooke Shields.

The plot of this film has a resemblance of the fairy tale, Little Red Riding Hood.

The film was received positively by most critics, who lauded the film's hard edged satire and performances.

Film critic Roger Ebert gave Freeway three and a half stars out of four and stated, like it or hate it (or both), you have to admire its skill, and the over-the-top virtuosity of Reese Witherspoon and Kiefer Sutherland.

Joe Baltake of The Sacramento Bee gave Freeway four stars out of four and called it a wild, audacious drive in attraction that takes the high from highbrow and the low from lowdown and shakes them up.

Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave Freeway four stars out of four and said that it was rude in the way the truth is rude, only funnier.

It received Two Thumbs Up on Siskel and Ebert At the Movies. Ebert stated that Witherspoon's performance was great and said Kiefer Sutherland balances it with a truly inspired villain. He also said how the film was filled with fine acting. He ended by describing it as compulsively watchable and noted that Witherspoon's performance promised an exciting career. Gene Siskel agreed completely with Ebert and commented on how the performances it hits the right notes. The only flaw they noted about the film was that it was too cute sometimes, but stated that it was a good film.

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
