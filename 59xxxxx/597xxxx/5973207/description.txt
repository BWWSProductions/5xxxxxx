LOSSLESS quality, recoded from FLAC to ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec)
using "ffmpeg -acodec alac" so it's ready for drag and drop in iTunes.

Due to the poor amount of lossless hardcore, post-hardcore, metalcore
and deathcore music torrents I'm starting a series of uploads using
other lossless rips from DD websites, forums and blogs.

And remember, if you like this band, support them going to shows,
purchasing CDs and merch. People needs money to live.
