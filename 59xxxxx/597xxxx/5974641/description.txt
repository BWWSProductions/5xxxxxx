Perhaps the most exhaustive and complete reworking of Superman II to date. Combining footage from the original Lester cut, the 2006 â€œDonner Cutâ€ and selected footage from Superman The Movie, along with extensive special effects corrections, this is the movie that Richard Donner never got to make, the movie you always wanted.
