Architectural Record Magazine. December 2010.

Architectural Record is an American monthly magazine dedicated to 
architecture and interior design, published by McGraw-Hill Construction 
in New York City. It is over 110 years old. While the magazine is aimed 
at professional architects and engineers with news, commentary, criticism 
and continuing education sections, it features numerous articles exploring 
cutting edge designs by leading architects with glossy photos and articles 
that are accessible to non-experts. The magazine holds a close relationship 
with the American Institute of Architects (AIA), notably through AIA 
Continuing Education sections offered in the magazine and on its website.
