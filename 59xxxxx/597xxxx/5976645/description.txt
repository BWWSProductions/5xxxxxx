Alexisonfire have come a long way the last few years. Now a PLATINUM act in Canada, the band has also established itself as a force in the US. They've done it along the same lines as a lot of the other successful Vagrant acts, through touring, word of mouth, and writing better songs with each release. This is indeed the album to take Alexisonfire from BIG to SUPERSTARS around the world. Crisis is heavy, catchy and shows remarkable growth. Album produced by Doug Boehm (Guided By Voices, Saves the Day, The Vines). HOMETOWN: Ontario, Canada
