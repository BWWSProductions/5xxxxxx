Have you ever wondered why some people can survive and prosper in the midst of adversity while everyone else around them crumbles?

Dan Castro conducted ten years of research into the lives of thousands of people throughout history who overcame extreme obstacles. He wanted to know if they were following any kind of pattern that could help explain their success. After ten years, Dan concluded that they are following a pattern, and that this pattern is both observable and exlpainable. In CRITICAL CHOICES THAT CHANGE LIVES, Dan put the best of the best stories side by side so others could see the same patterns he saw.

You will learn:
â€¢ The patterns that heroes have followed for thousands of years to turn tragedy into triumph.
â€¢ The three reasons why heroes thrive under pressure while others crack.
â€¢ What heroes choose to focus on in the heat of the battle.
â€¢ Why heroes choose their own beliefs even when the evidence looks grim.
â€¢ How heroes choose their own expectations when everyone else's expectations are low.
â€¢ The three critical choices that turn ordinary people into heroes.
