Video: CAM TD/Spanish Cam TDX/Screener Toxic thanks

Audio/Own

Okay this time we used the TD CAM was a little better then the tdx source had a huge timer on it that we blurred, also was missing odd scenes here and there so we muxed it with our v1, over coloring etc ran a lot of filters way more watchable then v1

Audio again is our own,yes i know file size is a little small but no need for a high bitrate and a huge file size if you are going to watch on p.c which is what i intended it for.I hate this movie had to sync every 6 seconds and no TS or R5 from us watching this was pure torture anyways enjoy till the TS comes not to far away
