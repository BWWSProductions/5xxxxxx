Says on the website that the new plugins have support for 64-bit. But when I put the ""Nik Software"" folder inside the Plugins folder inside CS5 64-bit it doesn't load the plugins :("
,kickst011,2010-11-26T09:13Z,These are not the latest versions with 64-bit compatibility. :(

Cannot find a serial for this anywhere!"
,billybob223,2012-02-15T22:26Z,I'm new here so please bear with the potentially noob question.  When I click the download button I get a down load for bflix which tries to install a bunch of crap.  I'm not getting the nik software pack at all.  A little help on using the site would be appreciated. thanks.
