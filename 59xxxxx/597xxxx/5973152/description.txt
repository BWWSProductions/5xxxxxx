In the near future, cloning is now technically advanced, but human cloning
is still illegal. Adam Gibson (Schwarzenegger) returns home after working with
his friend Hank Morgan (Rapaport), only to find a clone of himself with his
family. Before he has chance to find out the truth, he is attacked by a group
who want him dead. Adam must escape and find out the truth from the creator of
the clones, Michael Drucker (Goldwyn). Adam knows for sure you couldn't have
been cloned, but isn't ready for what he's about to hear.
