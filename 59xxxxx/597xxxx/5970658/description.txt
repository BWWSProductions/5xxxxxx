Loosely based on the life of Savinien Cyrano de Bergerac (1619-1655).
Best remembered now for his large nose, and Edmond Rostand's 1890's
play. Cyrano was a soldier, poet, and renowned swordsman. Also known
then for his nose, although mention of it was an invitation to a duel.



A free thinker. Part of MoliÃ¨re's literary circle. Assassinated by
unspecified enemies who dropped a house beam on his head. In
the play he survived this attack. In life it killed him.
