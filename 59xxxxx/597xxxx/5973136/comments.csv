IMDB doesn't have the details on the OAR (original aspect ratio) but all the trailers/clips available for the film are set at 2.35:1 whereas the sample file in this torrent is 1.85:1 and it actually does look a little too tight."
,mymateluke,2010-11-21T23:21Z,Fuck me Berklon. Are you for real? Its free! I bet it not as tight as your mum's arse though.......
,jangmuso,2010-11-23T15:42Z,"Indeed the movie is almost 16:9, which is not typical for cinema stuff. Thanks for pointing that out, berklon.


mymateluke: Just because it's free it doesn't mean it can't be criticized and made better.
If I spit in the food I give you, will you not complain about it just because you got it for free?"
