Nature Illusion Studio is a graphical authoring tool that lets you add unique effects to your photos.

It has three main areas: water, weather and sound. The first allows you to add effects of waves moving to any area of your photo, the second insert effects of rain or snow in the picture, and the third adds a soundtrack as background music or sound effects.



Combining all the effects together with a good image, you can get splendid animated landscapes that the program can be saved as screensavers, executables, graphics, animated GIF or AVI videos"
