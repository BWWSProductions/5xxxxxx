Dandy in the Underworld is the thirteenth and final studio album byrock
band T.Rex. It was released on March 11, 1977, and reached a chart peak in the
UK of #26. It was the band's highest-charting album since 1974's Zinc Alloy and
the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow.

At the time of the album's release Marc Bolan and T.Rex were on a UK tour,
supported by The Damned. The album and tour were notable for marking a return
to form for the band. Dandy in the Underworld gathered the most consistently
positive reviews for any T.Rex album in five years. Having fallen from critical and
commercial favour the band had endured some fiercely hostile press but NME,
who had been amongst the most negative, noted of the album: "very listenable,
well arranged immaculately played."

The sessions had started in Los Angeles in August 1976 and carried on until the
end of the year, in UK studios
