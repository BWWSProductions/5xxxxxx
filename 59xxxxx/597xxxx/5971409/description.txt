Have you enjoyed Final Fantasy VII with its detailed story line, multiple side quests and addicting mini-games only to realize once you were leveled up no opponents in the game offered you a challenge? Did you find yourself at the final boss only to destroy them in a few turns? Were you disappointed in Emerald and Ruby weapon the two Super bosses of the game?

Final Fantasy VII Hard Type begins addressing all these things and more by giving you a more challenging experience. In this game not only will monsters pose enough of a challenge to let you enjoy the devastating power of your final limit break more often; you'll find yourself needing every last drop of power your limit gauge has to offer.

The creator of this Final Fantasy VII mod GalenMyra did the best job possible to keep the experience as close to the original as possible; by increasing the difficulty of monsters and bosses. All dialogue has been untouched. Keep in mind this is Version 7 as Final Fantasy VII is unstable to edit where one bug may be addressed another could arise so be on the lookout for newer versions. You may notice in the background image before you start the game, in the lower right hand corner I have and will continue to post what version you are playing.
