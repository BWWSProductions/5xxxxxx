Nation's brand of melodic Hard Rock has been compared to such artists as Yngwie Malmsteen, TNT, Europe and Talisman in the past. "Without Remorse" sees the band expanding their range of influences and the likes of Dream Theater and Saga have also been mentioned due the newfound technicality of some tracks.

Hard Roxx gave "Without Remorse" 9/10 calling it "an essential addition to any melodic rock fans collection", "simply irrisistable" and "damn near indispensable". They praised the "super vocals" of Isaac Isaacson and the "outrageous Malmsteen/LeTekro shred" of guitarist Johnny Ohlin. Powerplay called Nation "very classy". Of Isaacson they said his "exhilarating vocals are especially noteworthy" and concluded that "They typify the high calibre of bands that are being attracted to Now & Then at the moment.".

NATION: Without remorse (Septima) I Japan blev Johnny Ã–hlin vald till Ã¥rets bÃ¤sta gitarrist 1995, dÃ¤r sÃ¥lde Nations debut 10 000 exemplar. FÃ¶r den som gillar Yngwierock alÃ¡ 80-tal Ã¤r Nation fantastiskt bra. Allt Ã¤r oklanderligt spelat, produktionen pompÃ¶s och snygg och sÃ¥ngaren som jag hackade pÃ¥ tidigare har blivit riktigt bra.Omodernt, men bra och "Waterloo" har blivit roligt uppruggad...


NATION is a very, very powerful sounding band. Each and every song on â€œWithout Remorseâ€ is a heavy metal hit! The musicianship featured on it is outrageous. The way I would describe Nations sound: Extremely clean and technical guitar, Soaring vocals and harmony, HUGE double kick drums and bass, and a super slick metal pop production that seals it together. This album is an absolute A+ in my opinion!! 


BRILLIANT 11*/10.F*cking f*cking brilliant.
