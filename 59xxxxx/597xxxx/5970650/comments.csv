Vad är det som skiljer? Har du tagit bort någonting eller censurerat?"

,Azzabat,2010-11-23T14:20Z,"Dear Anonymous uploader,

It would have been nice if you had left the English descriptive audio intact. It is annoying to download something which is supposed to have audio description and find that it has been removed by an uploader who considers this vital audio track CRAP!

I am visually impaired/blind and know first hand how important this audio track is. It increases my enjoyment of the film and makes it possible for my partner and I to sit through a movie without him having to describe everything that is going on. This is also difficult if he has never seen the movie before as he will not know what information is relevant. This means that we cannot watch a movie for the first time and experience it together.

Thankyou alderbaran for writing your informative post. With regard to the descriptive audio being removed. At least now I dont have to go through the frustration of not being able to find the AD track. Thank you for your post.

Please anonymous uploader leave your discs intact so that they can be of benefit to as many people as possible. I would also say this to anyone else who uploads content in DVDR format. Please give a full description of what audio tracks are available on the original disc.

Thank you.

,fetishgod,2011-01-15T20:35Z,"Azzabat, thank you for a good comment. My girl-friend is blind and as you can imagine it is very hard to get any audio described movies off the PB. Uploaders seem to be either oblivious to what it acctually is or impertinent enough to think that the AD feature is useless, not good for them, and in terms not usefull to anybody else too. I urge the uploader to put a full version here, it would please us a lot and shw much consideration from your side, not to say that blind people would have to feel discriminated that you don't let them to be a part of the audience. Food for though and thatks for consideration."
