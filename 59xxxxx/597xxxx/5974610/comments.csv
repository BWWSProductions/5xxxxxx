,gps1976,2010-11-23T17:38Z,"Seems to work fine on my nuvi 200 - note: if you are storing this in the Garmin folder on an SD card in the unit, rename this image file ""gmapsupp"" - insert card and restart"
,jdoubles,2010-11-24T09:47Z,"This worked great once I made a slight change on how to do this on my Street Pilot c530. 
1) Simply create a folder named ""Gramin"" on a 2gb SD card (Not SDHC). Make sure this card is completely empty.
2)Transfer the the zip file from your hardrive to the SD card and place it in the ""Garmin"" folder (you dont have to unzip or unrar this file, leave it alone)
3) Rename the file on the SD card ""gmapsupp"", (for me I did not add the .img extension, tried it first and didn't work, removed it and it worked)
4) Now enjoy having to 2011 maps!"
,nittany,2010-11-27T12:57Z,I'll download this and install it and test it out.  If I don't report back that means everything went fine.
,nittany,2010-11-27T13:21Z,"Detailed instructions for unlocked image files:


Use either Part A or Part B depending on your choice:

Part A â€“ Internal Memory

1. Connect your device to the computer.
2. Go into the Nuvi files and backup the file named â€œgmapprom.imgâ€ to your computer.
3. Delete the â€œgmapprom.imgâ€ file from the device.
4. Copy the unlocked â€œgmapprom.imgâ€ file that you downloaded into the device.
5. Restart your device and check your map info via : Tools>Settings>Map>Map Info.


Part B â€“ SD Card

1. Get a 2GB SD card (NOT SDHC) and format it FAT or FAT32

2. Create a folder on the memory card called â€œGarminâ€

3. Copy the downloaded â€œgmapprom.imgâ€ file into the Garmin folder on your SD card.

4. Rename the â€œgmapprom.imgâ€ to â€œgmapsupp.imgâ€ on the SD card.  Remember the "".img"" is just the file extension so you don't need to type that.

5. Insert the SD card into your Garmin GPS, and browse to your map information on your Garmin GPS and you should see the new maps selected. This can be found on the device via : Tools>Settings>Map>Map Info. (Note: The SD card must remain in your device if you want to use the maps.)

Why the renaming?

This must be done because this is not the primary mapset as it is being used from the SD card. The primary mapset is the one on the GPSâ€™s internal memory."
,HoslerG,2010-11-29T20:28Z,Can someone help me? Macbook Pro OS X 10.6.4 backed up the gmapprom.img and erased it from my Garmin 205 and then went to simply drag it into the folder and it just won't copy in. Any help would be much appreciated!

,joekim20,2010-12-01T03:37Z,Hey I was wondering how I can get the FM traffic after downloading the new map...my lifetime traffic doesn't seem to appear on the newly dled map...before I put the new map on..I had traffic reports but now I don't. hmm....

,nittany,2010-12-01T07:51Z,"***********WARNING***********

DO NOT INSTALL MAP UPDATES ON NUVI'S THAT HAVE VR (VOICE RECOGNITION) FEATURES OR YOU WILL LOSE THOSE FEATURES.  ALSO, THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMMENTING THAT ARE SAYING THEY LOST THEIR TRAFFIC FEATURES AS WELL.
"
,nittany,2010-12-01T08:55Z,"Just a warning to people out there, no matter what I did, I could not get my voice recognition features to work on my Nuvi 850 after installing this update.  It's not this update though, it's any update because I've tried several including the older 2011.10 maps and the VR features did not work either. Certain basic menu voice commands work, but the other ones do not.

I also tried the 2011.30 torrent from demonoid as well because for that one you have to install Mapsource and then Mapsource builds the mapset and transfers it to your GPS.  I figured if I did it that way maybe Mapsource would update the VR files on my unit, nope.


Apparently, the voice recognition (VR) files on the 8x0/8x5 series nuvis have to be updated to match the map. The map and the VR files are considered a ""set"", that is, the VR files are associated with their particular mapset. If those VR files are not used with their associated mapset, certain VR key commands (like searches for associated items in the mapset like addresses, POIs, etc) will not work.

I have no idea how to update the VR files to match the mapset, I assumed mapsource would do that automatically when it configures the map files and transfers them to your GPS. So I guess if I want updated maps on my Nuvi 850 I'm going to have to go without the VR features. I put back my old 2010.10 maps on the unit and all the VR features worked again, so it's definitely the maps causing the problem.


Too bad some hacker out there can't figure out a fix for this problem."
,WildcardHB,2010-12-04T00:33Z,"I can't get this to work on my Garmin 650.

I formatted a 2gb SD card to FAT32, created a Garmin Folder and put the ""gmapsupp.img"" file in there, but it's not showing up on the GPS.

I also tried naming the file ""gmapsupp"" without the .img extension, but no success.  Any thoughts?"
,gps1976,2010-12-05T20:44Z,"@WildcardHB 

You seem to have done right about the card format and placing this into the Garmin folder on it.  Make sure you still have your gmapprom file on the actual unit.  The only reason you rename this torrent's file gmapsupp is because it's a supplement to the main basemap gmapprom file.  Turn off your unit, insert the SD card, and restart.  You should see a little green progress meter go across the screen.  You should then be able to verify the map version in the Settings."
,Punkristo,2010-12-08T18:15Z,I cannot get it to work on the internal memory. It keeps showing the info from the old map.
,Punkristo,2010-12-09T20:53Z,Does this have the full map for Mexico? I was looking in Mexico city and it was only showing me the big highways! Does it have the normal streets for Mexico?
,WildcardHB,2010-12-13T08:31Z,"@gps1976

Yup, I understand that.  I have both the gmapprom on the internal memory and the gmapsupp on the SD card, but still no success.  I'm quite befuddled.

Maybe I'll try putting on the OEM maps back on the GPS internal memory.  It currently has a cracked 2011.10 version."
,grapow,2010-12-14T16:46Z,"I have an old c580...none of the above worked. But what did work was just connecting the unit to my computer via USB and swapping out this download with the gmapprom.img that is in there. You have to delete the older one first, or else there's no room. Keep a backup just in case. The transfer took a real long time (1-2 hrs)."
,joekim20,2010-12-16T11:43Z,I am a noob...the traffic worked...I didn't realized it only works when you hook it up to a power source...thanks for the upload! Works Great!
,poorerman,2010-12-17T13:46Z,"A noobie to maps and MapSource.  Can this map be used as the MapSource source map?  I've tried everything I can imagine but can't get MapSource to recognize this map from locations on either SD 2GB card (and renamed to gmapsupp.img and recognized by nuvi) or a folder on my PC.  I just purchased a nuvi 855 model for creating routes, only to find out that GoogleMaps and MapQuest no longer support route exporting to the device.  Using MapSource appears to be the only ""route"" (bad pun), but having great difficulty.  Anyone use this unlocked map with MapSource?  Thanks in advance."
,nittany,2010-12-20T05:27Z,"I want to correct something, I posted a warning telling people not to download this if your GPS has VR features.

Well you can download this fine and your VR features will still work as long as you put the map update on a SD card and don't put it on your GPS internal memory.

For anybody that is confused or having problems with this torrent follow the directions from Method 2 from the link below, I would also use Part B the SD card method that way you can't screw up your GPS internal memory.

Power up the GPS and worked number 1. Now the GPS is updated and it's a lot faster than it used to be.
