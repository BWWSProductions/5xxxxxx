Yes, the time has come again Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for a new kernel, and a new release of BackTrack. Codenamed Ã¢â‚¬Å“NemesisÃ¢â‚¬Â. This release is our finest release as of yet with faster Desktop responsiveness, better hardware support, broader wireless card support, streamlined work environment.

We could go on for pages on saying how great the new version is, but weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll cut to the chase, and give you the run down:

    * Kernel 2.6.35.8 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ *Much* improved mac80211 stack.
    * USB 3.0 support.
    * New wireless cards supported.
    * All wireless Injection patches applied, maximum support for wireless attacks.
    * Even *faster* desktop environment.
    * Revamped Fluxbox environment for the KDE challenged.
    * Metasploit rebuilt from scratch, MySQL db_drivers working out of the box.
    * Updated old packages, added new ones, and removed obsolete ones.
    * New BackTrack Wiki with better documentation and support.
    * Our most professional, tested and streamlined release ever.

For those wanting to upgrade an older release of BT4, an apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade should do the job.
