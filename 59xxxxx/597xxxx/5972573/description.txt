Paper Doll | Crystal Frost | PD  +  Pics

Crystal Frost thought the toughest part of being the bitch du jour for PD was just taking the pain but psychologically it is much worse than that. She does not just want her to just suffer, he wants her to ask for it. She has to lean forward and accept the torment. It is almost impossible to stay in the positions he tells her to. Between the pain she feels already and the knowledge that there is more to come she can hardly keep it together.
