Futuristic Dragon is a 1976 album by T.Rex. Preceded by two UK Top 40 hits, "New
York City" (#15) and "Dreamy Lady" (#30), Futuristic Dragon was released in
January, reaching #50. It was T. Rex's first album to register charts since Zinc Alloy
and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow in 1974. Live recordings of the successful tour
T.Rex undertook that year in the UK (the first since the birth of his son Rolan Bolan,
with Gloria Jones) show him to be returning to form from the cocaine addiction,
(alleged) Napoleon complex, and weight gain which had plagued him since late 1973,
when his star began to fall. In many of these (bootleg) recordings, often done by
members of the audience, Bolan thanks the audience for coming, and admits that he
did not know if they would. He was heartened by the response received on the two
aforementioned hit singles, and set to work on a new album immediately.

One factor which also sparked Bolan's renewed interest in music was the emergence
of punk. Photos from early 1977 show Bolan at a pub/restaurant with members of The
Ramones. He toured in spring 1977 with The Damned, and on the Granada TV show
"Marc", which he hosted, guests of his included The Boomtown Rats, The Jam, and
Generation X.

The album is also notable for the sleeve illustration by artist George Underwood, who
had last worked with Bolan on the 1968 Tyrannosaurus Rex album My People Were
Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair... But Now They're Content to Wear Stars on Their
Brows.
