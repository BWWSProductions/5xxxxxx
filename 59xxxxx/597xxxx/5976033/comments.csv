,BILALgs,2010-11-23T12:24Z,how can we copy it to ps3 hdd.thanx
,lfla,2010-11-23T16:38Z,"
Did anybody make it work?"
,Raficoo,2010-11-23T22:49Z,"Is this real or not? I've seen some people saying they're getting a different game, and why is this 13.73 while the others are almost 20GB? :("
,BILALgs,2010-11-24T11:47Z,"are these ps3 games depend upon region 
can we play usa region backup games on ps3 region coded europe "
,kludge420,2010-11-24T17:05Z,Fake. The US version is over 19GB. This is a fake.
[V],webchella,2010-11-24T18:52Z,It's good ...
,richto,2010-11-25T01:05Z,Works on FW 3.41?
,DDRobert,2010-11-28T21:10Z,"I don't believe this is a fake, it's simply the PAL version of the game since it has multi EUR languages with it such as spanish and french, but neither the real 19GB nor this 13GB PAL version play on my firmware 3.41. Any word yet on a patch, like with COD?"
,opalopaz,2010-11-29T17:21Z,It's not a fake. The problem is that you can't play it from an external HD(FAT32 won't allow files over 5gig) this has for example a file that is over 12gig.
,tnactim,2010-11-30T04:29Z,"Has anyone else confirmed this working on their 3.41 systems with the Prologue eboot?

,paddy0815,2010-12-26T10:53Z,"Still, GT5 is designed for FW3.50, so there is atm no option to get this working.
For updates look here: http://psx-scene.com/forums/f187/not-working-read-first-post-updates-gran-turismo-5-v3-50-only-70996/"
,njking25,2010-12-31T01:46Z,this is thirteen gigs because the ps3 has various file splitter and minimizer aps availible on th eweb. 
,richto,2011-01-03T19:42Z,"Fixed EBOOT now released to play on 3.41. See PS Groove site for links.
