,oldSMfan,2010-11-26T23:07Z,"@obiwancanblome
Just checked on your profile and suprisingly .... there is nothing there! Jezzz! I was taught that if you complain or criticize something, it is because YOU can do better! Having said that, ....... just look @ ""its"" surname!

Perfect as always aoloffline!
Cheers M8!
