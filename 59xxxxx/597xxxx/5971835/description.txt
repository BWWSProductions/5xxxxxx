This here is a CD of Anatol Ugorski at the piano, with Pierre Boulez conducting the Symphony Orchestra, in some of Scriabin's best known pieces. The Piano Concerto in F sharp minor is, seriously, the most fucking beautiful piece I have ever heard. It's hardly ever played in concert halls unfortunately, but we have this recording to get us through!
Format is FLAC. Enjoy!
