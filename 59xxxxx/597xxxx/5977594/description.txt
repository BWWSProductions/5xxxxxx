Monday, 22 November 2010

Description from the SchiffRadio web site ::

Filling in for Peter is Michael Pento, who will interview Chris Farrell, contributing editor at Bloomberg Businessweek, on why Ireland was done in by its low taxes. Later in the show Vincent Reinhart, resident scholar at The American Enterprise Institute and former director of the Federal Reserve Board's Division of Monetary Affairs, will join us to explain why a little quantitative easing is just what the doctor ordered.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
