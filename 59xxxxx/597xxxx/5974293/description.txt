"White Rice"

After an argument between Stan and Francine 
breaks out, Stan suggests they go see a 
counselor (guest voice Alexander), who 
hypnotizes Francine and reawakens her 
lifelong dream of being a comedian. 
Meanwhile, back in Langley Falls, Steve 
brings home a potential love interest for 
Klaus.

Enjoy :)
