OMC, or Otara Millionaires Club, was a music group from Auckland, New Zealand best known for their 1996 hit \\\"How Bizarre\\\" which was named as one of the greatest New Zealand songs of all time by the Australasian Performing Right Association. The full name of the band is a tongue-in-cheek reference to Otara\\\'s status as one of the poorest suburbs of Auckland.
