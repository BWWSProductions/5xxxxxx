,hakuna_matata,2011-02-03T18:27Z,"thx for all the work you put in. BBC coverage made the F! so much better. i cant put this in words man.. it was so much better. i didnt mind waiting for few days to watch this. i avoided newspaper TV news at times for weeks bcoz i couldnt watch these receordings and i didnt want to see the coverage of Espn asia man, BBC is so much better.  I just love the way they do it. BBC has made me more evolved as F1 fan rather than limited a Team OR DRIVER, F1 is awesome.
I just cant wait for 2011.

I just wish people dont post spoilers in comments this year."
,JT02,2011-02-05T18:29Z,"Thanks man you are awesome.  You don't know how much your torrents make my life here in Nascar country infinitely better.  The only thing I ask for is more!  I miss Anthony Davidson's practice commentary!  I can't wait for HD net year.

P.S. Speedvision sucks"
,giffo5,2011-02-10T00:28Z,"Not sure if your still checking this.... but do you have your equipment ready ?? lol....

F1 is almost here ! Woohoooo

Cant wait for HD... just bought a media player and hard drive to dl all the HD stuff ! 

Let me know if we can Donate to you TDMK1 !"
,duplo77,2011-03-17T13:25Z,Looking forward to your HD files for 2011. Only a week left. Cant wait. And thank you so much for your efforts.:)
,io23,2011-03-17T13:48Z,"Been seeding all 57 of your 2010 F1 files, all winter long. It's the LEAST we can do for ya! Hope (and pray) to see you here next week...

But more importantly, happy St. Patrick's day!:D"
,io23,2011-03-18T13:58Z,"BBC website videos wouldn't play in the country I'm in ATM, but this season they do! Hope they work for you guys in the US or Thailand or wherever:)

(The BBC F1 team preview the new season in the second of a series of discussions. This time they talk about what is new for 2011 including Pirelli tyres and moveable rear wings)"
,hakuna_matata,2011-03-20T18:47Z,"^ Thanks for link... 
yeah I hope they do. Season start in a few days now. Fingers Crossed :) "
,raymond_u,2011-03-22T09:37Z,"Hi there. Given that F1 is coming in with HD resolution, will you be posting stuff in HD? :D"
,Lm602,2011-03-24T20:38Z,Hey TDMK1! F1 this weekend! One thing that would make it better is if you would put up the practices too. Because in the US i have to be up really late to see them; and its on speedtv so it SUCKS! Thanks alot. Looking forward to the HD.
,EdoSensei,2011-03-25T06:24Z,"I DLed all the races via you last season and am very grateful! But having just read your comments here, please don't be uploading MKVs this year. I watch stuff through my PS3 into my TV and it won't play back MKVs. Last years file type was just perfect.

Looking forward to this weekend!"
,tony4finger,2011-03-26T07:42Z,"ae we not see you here , i hope you are fine mate"
,raymond_u,2011-03-26T08:32Z,Any ETA on the qualy hour we just watched? :D
,raymond_u,2011-03-26T15:43Z,where's the melbourne qualifying? Will it be 1080p?
,io23,2011-03-28T09:26Z,"Not sure what's goin' on this season, but I'm pretty sure these are TDMK1:

(The way the races are named looks like an exact match. I could be wrong of course, but I doubt it.)"
,raymond_u,2011-03-29T04:14Z,"Could be, but I don't think so. If it was TDMK1 the forum would be up :P"
