,thelacha,2010-11-22T08:02Z,"Hello,
The Great FXG.
Your uploads are always fantastic.
I am classic Hollywood's fan.
I have a suggestions for you.
Why don't you upload Bluray Rips instead of DVDrips. Ideal Size is 1.3 to 1.5 GB with FXG logo would be great. Its just a suggestion, because technology improves everyday.
Regards"
