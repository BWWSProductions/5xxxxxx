Canada's Worst Driver 5 is the fifth season of Canada's Worst Driver, the Canadian automotive television series on Discovery Channel which seeks to improve the skills of eight of the worst motorists in Canada.

In this season, the eight contestants are taken to the Driver Rehabilitation Centre in CFB Borden, which had been previously used in Canada's Worst Driver 2. Unlike Canada's Worst Driver 2, however, it is only referred to on-air as an "undisclosed military location".

The series launch was set to coincide with the launch of a new law in Ontario prohibiting the use of handheld electronic devices while driving. Similar bans have been instituted in Atlantic Canada and Quebec, with Manitoba and Saskatchewan considering similar laws. This season will also be the second to be featured on the iTunes Store and the first to have new episodes one day after first airing.
