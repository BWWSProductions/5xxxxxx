,HiroPro2,2011-03-30T08:12Z,"Mp3 101 !!!

(1) Encode using LAME (itunes is CRAP using Fraunhofer encoder boo!!)

(2) Set encoder to VBR (variable bit rate) as LAME was engineered for this. CBR is CRAP and in all honesty a VBR altpreset standard at -2 is as good as a 320 CBR !!!! and file is WAY SMALLER!!!

(3) SET IT TO JOINT STEREO NOT ""STEREO"" and if I have to explain don't ask because you have no comprehension of what the setting actually does!!!

owhh and LEARN how to use GOOGLE and RESEARCH ripping music PROPERLY you 320 CBR stereo Fraunhofer RETARDS!!! 

PS or buy/steal DBpoweramp !!!"

But if only get 1 person to read it i feel it's worth it.

I'm trying to be an artist like a million else

I'm maybe no diffrent yet, but it would mean the world to me to get a decent following on youtube and know that i can entertain alot of people out there.

If you ever read this, please give my Dubstep track a listen ""Kid Chemical - Genesis"" on youtube. Subscribe and Like!!!

Thank you & Enjoy.

To the haters..we don't care what a few close minded self absorbed people say! Don't like it , don't listen. Its sad that you even take the time to search out this torrent to just be an arse and insult people. 

Get some help, maybe you'll feel better about your existence!"
