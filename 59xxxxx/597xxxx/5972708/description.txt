While the title of The E.N.D. was a play on words (standing for The Energy Never Dies), the new albums title, The Beginning, refers to what is actually happening in the world right now, says will.i.am. The Beginning is symbolic of adopting new technologies, such as augmented reality, 3D, and 360 video. Its also about being experimental and taking songs weve liked from the past and playing around with sick, crazy beats.
