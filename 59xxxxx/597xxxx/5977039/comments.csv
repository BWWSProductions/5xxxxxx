Torrent d/l & Magnet link both work, it's on your end."
,A123Z,2010-11-24T16:11Z,"Same here, directly clicking the download links gives me an error, ""saving as"" gives me a .torrent file which doesn't work."
,bLuNtEd_aSsHoLe,2010-11-24T23:07Z,"yah im srry but its not on my end,the torrent link is fucked"
,bLuNtEd_aSsHoLe,2010-11-24T23:13Z,yah neither the torrent link nor magnet link work
,dm30001,2010-11-30T23:30Z,Magnet link worsk fine in latest utorrent but the torrent file doesn't. gives an error. thanks for the up!

srry blacktroy good work"
,pirate-love,2010-12-04T04:04Z,The magnet link worked for me. Great upload. Thank you.
,michaelwhite1324,2010-12-05T08:41Z,"i have the new uTorrent, and i downloaded it from the magnet.  But when I tried to open it, my computer didnk know what program to use on it!!! Heeeelp!"
,michaelwhite1324,2010-12-05T08:42Z,"in other words, my computer doesnt know how to open it, or if there's even anything to really open once completed downloading on uTorrent."
,MacPlus,2010-12-06T07:40Z,"Yes, there is an issue with the links. I'm running BT 7.2 (current version). DL link leads to an error page, and the Mag Link opens DL setup dialog but the file name is all that is there, size shows up as 0b. After clicking OK or DL or whatever the ""GO"" button is, it starts the DL and fills in the blanks... Just out of curiosity, what app (and version) was used to create the .torrent file?

Very nice UL anyhow, thanks a bunch."
,Old_Joe,2010-12-09T00:10Z,"my computer also doesnt know how to open it. what do i use to open a ""nrg"" file?"
,Stendoras,2010-12-09T21:24Z,"
I downloaded it from the magnet link, (when it asks you, choose to open it with Îźtorrent)
For  .nrg file use poweriso (you can find it easily in the tpb) ... 
1. from the tab ""mount"",
2. set number of drives to ""1"",
3. mount the .nrg file,
4. go to ""my computer"" and
5. double click the directory that you created....

Thank you,
A happy iphone owner from Hellas"
,ufeeling,2010-12-14T01:01Z,"Great upload Blacktroy.  Just what I was looking for.

One problem I am running into though.  About 260 songs into backing up my Ipod, I get a ""you've reached the 100 song limit on this evaluation copy"".  Now, I followed the instructions, used the key gen and submitted the keys and name into the program.  It says I have successfully activated CopyTrans under the Purchase/Activate Tab.  Is there are song that's causing the issue?  I have a feeling this is on my end.

Thanks."

No, you are quite right. I've had this issue with every version I've found so far... I can't find a working one. :("
,lexrabz,2010-12-19T11:26Z,"just downloaded it, but the new version is 4.30...can you post the new password for the 4.30...please...thanx...the rest works great"
,lexrabz,2010-12-19T11:29Z,can you post the new activation key for the 4.30...the rest of the apps are working perfectly...the only problem is that it wont acept the key for .20..thanx thanx thanx..great upload
,flittydub,2010-12-23T06:18Z,installs v. 4.3 on my pc but serials for copytrans 4.2 don't work with it... therefore the main app in the suite won't activate now. BLACKTROY thanks for this up but now we need updated keygen. or how do i force it to install v 4.2? 
,flittydub,2010-12-23T08:27Z,"@lexrabs
found a solution to the 4.30 - 4.20 keygen confusion... go to torrentz website & search copytrans & u will see a list of hits. go to the torrent that is at top of the list (25mb) in this version it installs v4.26 & the keygen is compatible with all versions. helped me, hope it helps someone else. peace"

,litsas23,2011-01-23T00:49Z,what firstg and last name do i use when im activating this?
,reeboker_cz,2011-02-08T12:25Z,"thanks blacktroy, luv ya, saved my arse from using the stupidest mobile app i know (iTunes)"
,PIRATE-555,2011-03-05T22:44Z,"A truly OUTSTANDING program!  I have NO idea why, but iTunes stopped me from adding MANY of the folders and music I wanted to my iPod!  

COPYTRANS somehow woke iTunes up and now iTunes allows ""most"" Folders to be added, however, COPYTRANS seems to CONSISTENTLY get the job done!  Once COPYTRANS is done iTunes catches on and Syncs up just fine with my new additions.

I have not tried to backup my iPod with COPYTRANS because iTunes appears to be doing that just fine ~ once it's slapped around a bit.

THANK YOU!

,ZeroC...,2011-06-11T19:30Z,"So I used the magnet link, everything installed correctly, problem is that when I try to activate it to get off of trial mode, it says that the activation code is no longer valid. any advice? this is on versions:
copytrans 4.72
photo 2.87
swift 1.56
cloner 2.41
doctor 1.63
libs 2.46"
,E30TECH,2011-07-23T00:21Z,"Thanks for the up.
Thanks too flittydub for the keygen info"
,PIRATE-555,2011-08-12T18:52Z,"PROBLEMS!  The Keygen for iCloner no longer works!  I did not try the other keygens for other elements or tools within the program.

When CopyTrans installs it goes online and auto-upgrades to Version 2.42!  If you try a install with the Internet disconnected your install will NOT proceed.  

The Keygen for iClone is for Version 2.37 and ALL serials created are now rejected.

I would highly recommend that you remove  older versions BEFORE you attempt to upgrade because I had some real problems trying to overwrite the old version.  Seems the uninstaller leaves elements of the old version still installed, so I kept getting a message to remove the old version first.

I finally had to use ""Your Uninstaller"" (a OUTSTANDING program) before I could proceed to a updated (V2.42) install.

ARGGGGG, my 1st Mate for a working Keygen!  

Anyone know someone on the French FFF Crew?

,PIRATE-555,2011-08-12T19:30Z,"Here is more!  (Aug. 12, 2011)

From the CopyTrans Site:

""Does iCloner work with iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad?""

""Unfortunately the current version does not. We plan on adding this feature in the future.""
