If you ever wondered what ambient music is all about, you could do worse than listen to the soundtrack by Brian Eno that accompanied the stunning visuals of NASA*s Apollo missions to the moon. Created with an intoxicating mixture of acoustic and electronic, the music makes the now-classic space travel images more magical and memorable, introducing a dreamlike element to scenes of cold reality. *An Ending (Ascent)* is about as close to an actual tune as you*ll get, but, as with every track, a shining example of what ambient music reveals about itself--slowly and carefully. -- Paul Clark
