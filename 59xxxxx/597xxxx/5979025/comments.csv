,665w4w2d,2010-11-24T01:17Z,Not to complain but looks like a cam.
,lynx_ca,2010-11-24T08:34Z,"watermark in the right side middle of the screen, seems to be through the whole movie. 

audio is definatly cam... 

video is no better then a decent cam. 

definatly not a dvdscr. i recommend waiting for a better copy. 
but if your desperate to see this movie.. i guess its watchable. "
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-11-24T13:56Z,I hate when people bullshit and say it is a DVDSCR.. really? We'll see. I highly doubt it judging other comments.
