 Martial Arts


Action superstar Donnie Yen (Ip Man) has outdone himself once again with his hot-blooded portrayal of Chen Zhen in this re-imagination of the legendary Chinese folk hero! Bruce Lee famously created the character in his 1972 masterpiece Fist of Fury, and Jet Li starred in Gordon Chan's acclaimed 1994 remake Fist of Legend, even Donnie himself has played the character in a 1995 TV series. Rather than doing another remake, Donnie now teams up with writer/producer Gordon Chan and director Andrew Lau (Infernal Affairs) to further the story of Chen Zhen, turning the furious avenger into a World War I veteran, secret agent, and masked kung fu superhero!
