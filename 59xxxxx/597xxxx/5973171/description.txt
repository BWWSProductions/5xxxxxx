With other audio grabbers you usually need to listen to every grabbed wave because they only do jitter correction. Scratched CDs read on CD-ROM drives often produce distortions. But listening to every extracted audio track is a waste of time. Exact Audio Copy conquer these problems by making use of several technologies like multi-reading with verify and AccurateRip.

The Wind That Shakes the Barley, recorded at the historic 1832 Sharon Temple outside of Toronto, finds the multi-instrumentalist McKennitt in a slightly more spare folk setting than her more recent expansively produced works. 

There's a certain fragility at the heart of Barley's most tender ballads -- "On a Bright May Morning", "The Parting Glass" -- an intimacy that extends throughout what is easily one of McKennitt's most personal albums. 

"Every once and again there is a pull to return to one's own roots or beginnings," says McKennitt, "with the perspective of time and experience, to feel the familiar things you once loved and love still."
