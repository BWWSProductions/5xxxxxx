Yui, Ritsu, Mio, Mugi and Azu-Nyan are all back for another season, and ive compiled all the episodes into one folder. no more running around to other places on the interwebs to find broken links and scams, i got it all right here.

These files are in MKV format, with english hard subs. i may upload them in AVI later, but i am running low on computer space at the moment, so i cant really do anything at the moment. still, they are all here in high quality format, if you cant get them to play for some odd reason, you can always try Media Player Classic, or my personal fav for having a ton of codecs, VLC.

as always, thanks for downloading from me, and if you like the upload, by all means, please send me a comment. i try to keep my uploads at top quality, and id appreciate you guys leaving me feedback so i can continue to do so just dont forget to punch that comment button every once in a while mmkay?
