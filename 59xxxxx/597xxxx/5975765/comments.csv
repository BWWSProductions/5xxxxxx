,Tash_Alistair,2011-01-17T18:24Z,"Okay, so i had to re-install windows on my lappy due to a hard drive crash, and i lost all my torrents. so id appreciate it if all you guys keep seeding the hell outta this one. once completed ill get back to my seeding schedule. thanks to all who enjoy this torrent, and good pirating to all!"
,nickhawaii,2011-02-25T16:18Z,Finally found this torrent... it's buried under a lot of crap non-anime torrents when you're using the search bar. >< Thanks for uploading this!
,Liet727,2011-04-06T23:41Z,"Thank god someone decided to upload this!  One small thing though, Episode 2 seems to be damaged.  After 2 or 3 minutes, it's completely unplayable.  Going to redownload and see if there's any change."
,Liet727,2011-04-07T01:10Z,"No change, and in fact several episodes seem to have damaged spots.  They only seem to last for less than a minute, but it's difficult to get the player (VLC) to move passed the damaged area.  In any case, they're still watchable.  Thanks again."
,jelloskater,2011-05-07T21:21Z,everything plays perfect. episodes are not damaged. the problem with yours is probably the fact that vlc player has trouble playing mkvs that are split into different scenes. you can disable scenes somewhere in advanced settings when playing mkvs to get it to play fine.
,jelloskater,2011-05-10T04:09Z,"my first comment was before watching. quality is perfect. but there is a mistake. the episode labeled 27 is really the 25th episode and the 25th episode is from earlier on in the series. there really isn't a 27th episode, but there is a ova after episode 26.

p.s. episode 24 is really the ending of the series. 25 and 26 are pretty much bonus episodes that take place earlier in the series."

Turns out you're right.  Finally looked up a detailed fix for this issue after encountering it with another torrent.  Link is below.

Thanks again Tash_Alistair for uploading!"
,Tash_Alistair,2011-10-07T04:22Z,"yes, i had the same issues with vlc at times, especially with an anime called sumomomo momomo. what i did was got the k-lite codec pack which came with media player classic. actually, here is a link to the different versions. just pick which one is best for you, (http://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm)
