This book introduces the inter-disciplinary study of childhood and youth and the multi-agency practice of professionals who serve the needs of children, young people and their families. Exploring key theories and central ideas, research methodology, policy and practice, it takes a holistic, contextual approach that values difference and diversity for example, investigating concepts such as identity, representation, creativity and discourse and issues such as ethnicity, gender and the childhood in crisis thesis. Furthermore, it challenges opinion by exploring complex and controversial modern-day issues and by engaging with a range of perspectives to highlight debates within the field.
