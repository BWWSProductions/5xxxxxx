Special thanks to JB59 for the original and great uploaded .avi

I have done many special tricks here to increase quality. Check it, you will enjoy!

Plus, the video card you have can now accelerate the video.

IVTC (inverse telecine), de-blocking, sharpening, black bars cropped and other things applied.

Video is as is in the screen shot. No cropping done to that at all compared to the vid.

Enjoy!

Here's the Day Version I made with the same process:
