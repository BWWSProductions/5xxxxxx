[V],twentyforty,2010-11-20T19:55Z,"@rojenatgmail: Already asked few times - and no, I cannot - MANY dozens of HP packs already exist - from extra-small to untouched BluRay ones."
,redvanilla,2010-11-20T21:14Z,"Good evening,

Do the words: "" REQUESTS ARE ""FROZEN"" "" some kind of hidden meaning I am not aware of?
Is there any common comprehendable reason for disrespecting this little detail?

If you know the answer, please share!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-20T21:41Z,"@redvanilla: Nope, there is no ""hidden meaning"" in  REQUESTS ARE ""FROZEN"".

>""Is there any common comprehendable reason for disrespecting this little detail?""

Nope, other than cancer I have there is no other ""small"" details."
,redvanilla,2010-11-20T23:17Z,"@twentyforty: If only people here would have the courtesy to read the headers of your torrents and follow the comments a little ... - hopefully they would give you a break! Or is it lack of interest? By all of you? - Get the hint?

Everybody downloading your torrents should have noticed you are seriously ill. It is dissapointing people do not care. 

Nevertheless, even without the issues stated in the  beginning and your little ""detail"" -  people should show respect."
,redriding,2010-11-21T06:47Z,"Thank you for Supernatural... 

@twentyforty ... when do you get to rest? if you have to do what everyone constantly demands and guess what - without payment. You do it out of kindness .... I just hope that people appreciate that fact.
