Battle of the Blades S02E15: Final Performance Show

Battle of the Blades is a Canadian figure skating reality show and competition that airs on CBC. The series resembles Dancing with the Stars, but in this case the women are famous figure skaters and the men are well-known hockey players.

If you are a fan of figure skating, ice hockey or Dancing With The Stars, this show is worth a try.

The 3 final pairs are:
- Patrice Brisebois and Shae-Lynn Bourne
- Todd Warriner and Isabelle Brasseur
- Valeri Bure and Ekaterina Gordeeva

Two of the judges are the same each week: Sandra Bezik and Jeremy Roenick. The guest judge this week is Christopher Dean. The hosts are Kurt Browning and Ron MacLean.

This week, the 3 final pairs each skated a new number and an old favourite. The 3 judges provided commentary as usual, but did not score the performances. Instead, the results are completely decided by the home audience.

This episode aired on CBC on Nov 21, 2010.
