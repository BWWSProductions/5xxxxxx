Unlike you, i dont give a shit about reputation or a skull or something like that. I try to bring here what i use myself, i found this version of Windows Loader on www.rlslog.net go there and u can find it yourself. Check my other torrents before talking trash. I upload torrents here only for fun and i try to upload only what i think is good i have another job im not like users like u who spend 25 hours out of 24 on piratebay uploading torrents. thats all kid."
[V],DeGun,2010-11-23T23:34Z,"MAn this loader from the place you say is probably infected straight from the exe which make it not detectable by antivirus or malware apps . 
Size is too big see the diff between this one you did upload and the one i ve done : more 5MB ! can you explain this ? as well can you explain that there is many differents unknown userz posting everyday different links to the same loader ? links from well known money makers so man come on - not saying you are not trustable - just saying that THIS KIND OF APPS SHOULD NOT BE UPLOADED by user like you with not yet a status , why dont you carry on on music stuff etc ... ? you say you work in an informatic shop so why do you need this shit ? 
MAN the place you say is a shit one ALL UPLOADERZ ARE ANONYMOUS ON THIS PLACE you cannot check their reliability  or see if they did upload many times many good apps so how come an professional informatician like you trust these guys  ? 
BTW : i spend 18h in my society which by hazard is computering - society that i created on my own and run on my own , im always on the move sorting people out with their compuuter so lol 25h out of 24 on TPB ? i'm just a guy who dont sleep more than 4 max 5h so no time to be 110% of time on TPB . 

Carry on uploading  but forget these apps too risky and who knows ? i could be the one applying for you to have a skull one day ya never know ? 

BUT DONT TRUST ANYONE god damn noob OR USE something like SANDBOX before opening these kind of apps YOU COULD BE WELL SURPRISED SOMEDAY .

All been a noob one day innit ?

Dont be offended buddy you shall be big enough to understand that anonymous userz shouldnt risk to upload that WHEN THEY DONT EVEN MENTION that the apps was use  throughout sandbox' . "

[V],DeGun,2010-11-24T16:46Z,"hey no worry with D3Linquent it tries uploading good stuff so nuff respect for that - plz check this : 
http://thepiratebay.org/search/daz%201.9.5/0/3/0

see that all last DAZ LOADERz from pink skull userz is 1.40MB MAX instead this one and other ThumperTM is 6MB so i am wondering : WHY ? 

plz use sandboxie to make sure no dirty stuff execute itself in ur back people .

D3linquent man - keep up the good work all right ? but try to use sandboxie as you ll be surprised how good this little thingy is . 
Apologies if i seemed a bit rough i can admit that all right ? so as suggested above SHAKE HANDS and thx for trying uploading good stuff but i still dont know why there is such a diff. in size .

PEACE buddy - "
,D3LinQuENT,2010-11-24T21:36Z,"@DeGun

the reason they are at smaller sizes is because they are rared and this one is uncompresed thats why it bigger if u download this and compress it with WinRAR it will become 1.26MB"
[T],pkaji123,2010-11-25T03:50Z,"The uncompressed size of this loader is 3.07 MB not 6 MB,then how come its x2 times bigger???"
