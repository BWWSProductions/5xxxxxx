My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is the fifth studio album by American hip hop artist Kanye West, which was released on Roc-A-Fella Records on November 22, 2010 and the deluxe edition releasing on 29 November 2010. The album was formerly known as Good Ass Job and tentatively Dark Twisted Fantasy, before being renamed. Production for the album began in early 2010, with West spending most of his time recording in Hawaii. GOOD Music artist Big Sean was the second to announce the title of the album as Good Ass Job" (after a 2005 interview with West while he was promoting his second album, Late Registration) which falls in line with the album West had planned to put out following Graduation before he released 808s & Heartbreak instead. Production will come from West himself, Q-Tip, DJ Premier, RZA, Pete Rock, Madlib, DJ Toomp, Swizz Beatz, Lex Luger, and Justin Vernon.

MY BEAUTIFUL DARK TWISTED FANTASY includes Nikki Minaj, Jay-Z, Rick Ross, and Justin Vernon of Bon Iver on the smash street single "Monster" and Pusha T on "Runaway" which received the Best New Music stamp from Pitchfork. Other guests include Kid Cudi and Raekwon and contributing producers include RZA of Wu-Tang Clan, Pete Rock, and Q-Tip. This album was recorded in Honolulu and at the legendary Electric Lady Studios in New York City.
