,micwood50,2010-11-20T20:35Z,Does anyone know quality or is this real?
,SilenTony,2010-11-20T22:08Z,"That's the real thing.

Video is pretty good for a cam, can't really judge audio as I don't speak Russian. :'("
,avont,2010-11-20T23:32Z,"no it is not..

the audio is better...but for the rest it is the same spanisch video with the 36min of good qualiti pasted on an extreemly bad cam.

this one has the original quality of the 36min fragment though....but after that...blurry like hell..not watchable.

kinda dissapointing...seems like Holywood won this one...no watchable copy made it to the internet..."
,thepowersurge,2010-11-21T00:49Z,"it seems that every file that has to do with this movie is getting dropped or the input file is missing within a few mins of it hitting the internet, combined with the 'leak' overflowing servers and an abundant amount 'coral player' crap.  wb can say what they want. this is a hollywood shutdown of the premier of this movie... but meh they can't keep it up forever by next week there will be something viewable."
,The_Reasoner,2010-11-21T02:14Z,"I was thinking about the same thing, powersurge. HP is huge at the box office, and the studios are definitely doing whatever they can to keep it out of our hands. 

The leaking of the 36 minute clip is especially strange... it's not often that we see just the first 36 minutes of a movie leak out. It's usually all of it or nothing. I wonder if WB leaked it intentionally, make a less-than-perfect cam copy like this seem even more disappointing..."
,bubbanuggzz,2010-11-21T03:20Z,"WB did leak the 36mins.the full one will b out in about 2 weeks,WB just doesnt know it yet.patiance is a virtue my friends."
,jerms_001,2010-11-21T04:15Z,damn man.. wheres the real one
,chem41,2010-11-21T05:46Z,when is the whole screener coming
,fadedexile,2010-11-21T07:39Z,"we'll get the good stuff eventually. I would try to cam it but the theater here had a guy come in and walk through twice during the movie checking people out, possibly looking for cams?"
,igoryxa,2010-11-21T09:48Z,"СВЕРШИЛОСЬ!!!11=DDD...Бльо...Только почему скачать низя?Пишет ""но файл инпут чтода там""..Касяг"
,igoryxa,2010-11-21T09:51Z,Ой..Уже качаю с помощью магнет линк..Огромное спасибо релизеру=)
,jrdburrow,2010-11-21T11:13Z,"At least yall have the potential to take a cam with you to try it :P  Here, they run a metal detector search, cant even bring our cell phones in gotta leave them in the car.  Its why I dont bother going to the theatre - sounds like just asking to have my $300 iPhone swiped while Im watching a vid.  
They don't realize being so anti-piracy is actually encouraging piracy, lol.  Ill buy the vid when it comes out on DVD, but I'm not going to pay to watch a vid in near prison-tight security."
,DyerQ,2010-11-21T11:53Z,THX спасибо мужики!
,stalnov,2010-11-21T12:21Z,No input file specified. wtf ?
,avont,2010-11-21T12:41Z,"yep...I've been watching the uploading the whole knight....(yep, I know...but my job gives me to much spare time)

Every torrent that is different from the obvious scams and is not the spanish version got removed within seconds of showing up....its obvious...the torrentsites are working together with hollywood...the ultimate betrayal...

But besides that...there must be an option in the country's in europe where they use subtitels....

(The Netherlands, Belgium,...)

Those country's unlike America still know freedom and stuff...The people are not used to a fascist treatment like the US...we would never accept to be treated like criminals by a local theater. (we would probable burn down the theatre and lynch the one with the metal detector)

So it is VERY easy to use a cam there..and the quality is better since most of the theaters are brandnew and state of the art.

when you upload it...upload in several different parts...they only remove the ones with movielike content...not the ones that have the size  of the 36 min version..."
,avont,2010-11-21T12:55Z,"for the US citicens....

FIGHT it...start a pettition and call out a boycot against the theaters

Theaters abusing the panic about terrorisme and treating you all like criminal suspects should NOT BE TOLLERATED.

theaters are NOT police officers and dont have the wright to invade on your privacy like that...

Further more..confiscating a camera or phone from a customer is a felony...you can have them arrested for that !!!!! They have the wright to ask you to hand it over or they can ask you to leave...but under NO CIRCUMSTANSES they have the right to take your personal possestions.

If they do...there commit a robbery...then you should charge them."
,Ralink,2010-11-21T19:47Z,maybe you should but the harry potter file under a different name...or somethign lol
,seangreeley1,2010-11-22T04:19Z,change the filename so wb cant trace it or track it that way it makes it harder for them to remove it and then let ppls know what the name is and  there ya go 
,jkid2010,2010-11-22T04:20Z,"Are they really working with WB to stop this? It definitely seems strange that a leak of the movie, good quality, with a WB watermark just suddenly appears. And we have just one available copy, that is clearly unwatchable. Along with torrents that are given no time to be decided if real or fake because they're deleted, something fishy?"
,jkid2010,2010-11-22T04:27Z,Why did my comment get deleted?
,keith23uk,2010-11-22T04:46Z,"Wait for the actual Russian cam to be released! This is the same old crappy spanish cam. Whole screener doesnt exist so far. Will be a few months beofre a screener comes out.
Imagine usually uses the good quality source so sugest wait for them. Not that the movie much good mind you as I went to see it. M = 1/10"
,danford,2010-11-22T07:11Z,"""change the filename so wb cant trace it or track it that way it makes it harder for them to remove it and then let ppls know what the name is and there ya go""

a good idea in theory, but doing so would clearly spawn many many more fakes :("
,Vulcan262,2010-11-22T08:10Z,"@avont,

I have been boycotting the Theaters and Hollywood now for a couple of years, as well as FOX TV, the TV one would take more explaining, but the entertainment industry now seem to think they own and run the country, just like the big oil companies and other companies. It seems like more and more companies like them and the gov't want to take more and more of our freedom away now days."
,Vulcan262,2010-11-22T08:12Z,"It seems like I can't post what I want to now?
WTF?"
,sarepta_knight,2010-11-22T08:38Z,"its so bad guys watching a movie in bad quality, just like having sex with an old lady :P this movie is better be watched in theater or in a blu ray.
quit trying pals :) go get a life"
,jkid2010,2010-11-22T08:55Z,"Seen this in theaters, it was great. I'm going again this week. Still want a good cam version though, where are they hiding? :D"
,Vulcan262,2010-11-22T22:54Z,"Still waiting for a better cam version here as well, hopefully there will be one up soon, then I will download it."
,WombatSoup,2010-11-23T02:56Z,go sneak into the movies if you want to see it so bad. you won't find a good copy for at least a week. that and it's broken up in 2 parts. i'd rather wait until both are out. better watching experience.
