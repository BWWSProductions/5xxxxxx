The Field is a monthly glossy dedicated to those brave souls who shoot, fish and hunt way beyond the call of duty. Since 1853, its staff has selflessly brought its readers the cream of rural life, be it pheasant shooting, dry-fly fishing or the distinct merits of Cheval Blanc. If you love fieldsports, guns that can fire a spud 130 yards and very foxy friends at hunt balls, The Fieldâ€™s for you. If you donâ€™t, well, heigh-ho.
