,shumi93,2010-11-20T21:56Z,Possibility of playing with 3.41 ??
,ahmed919,2010-11-21T01:28Z,Lmao took two days to download... this is fucking Yakuza 4 NOT gran turismo 5 got me good tho lol
,DoodleBop,2010-11-21T01:29Z,"shumi93 > think for a second moron ... it says compatible with jailbreak, and jailbreak is only compatible on 3.41."
,DDRobert,2010-11-21T09:39Z,"is it really Yakuza 4, because that's not out in the US yet either, so that'd be cool since I've been looking for that one on here as well."
,xlemuelx,2010-11-21T10:00Z,real? wtf?
,Krock0,2010-11-21T10:57Z,"Yakusa 4 ? Yes, and what else. EUR version is already for sale in Europe and it as 14Gb."
,erkele,2010-11-21T11:14Z,"GT5 it is.
Dunno what's with this Yakuza 4 crap - unless ofcourse someone's seen the trouble of making a fake game filestructure with Gran Turismo 5 TITLE.ID, ICON0, PIC0, PIC2.PNG's & PARAM.SFO. :P"
,DDRobert,2010-11-21T23:55Z,"So I'm assuming whatever game we've decided this is, it IS patched, right? Cause I want Yakuza 4 and GT5, so I don't care as long as it's patched. If I put this on my external HDD and it tries to install 3.50 I'm kickin' someones ass"
,Anonymal,2010-11-22T17:10Z,Can anyone confirm this is patched/working? Or does it need a 3.5 spoof? Make to make sure before I download a massive 19gb.
,gani.slimshady,2010-11-26T02:45Z,It doesn't work on 3.41 as of now
,xlemuelx,2010-11-28T07:23Z,someone comfirm if its GT5 working?
,DDRobert,2010-11-28T22:19Z,any word on a patch for 3.50 or how to get PSGroove (RAW) to downgrade back to 3.41. I know jailbreak can but I PSGroove'd - t'was cheaper
,namit1malik,2010-12-06T07:31Z,"i spoofed the firmware,but when i ran the game all i can see is a black screen"
,xlemuelx,2010-12-07T07:41Z,so i can safely say its not working on 3.41 jb
,namit1malik,2010-12-08T09:12Z,"nope, still not working...searched some internet forums but no luck so far"
,onecki,2010-12-17T16:26Z,"it is a usb board compatible and all the GT5 ISOs are 19GB, PUPs are PUPs when you reverse engineer. BTW Jailbreak is dead from 5.55, SO DONT UPGRADE!"
,alimadhi,2010-12-19T07:43Z,"Hey, SOSteam !!!

Are you sure? It works
If i update my PS3 to 3.50, then my ps3break will not work !!!!
So what to do ؟؟؟؟"
,dino1982,2010-12-21T21:57Z,Please seed...tnx
,alimadhi,2010-12-22T11:59Z,Please seed  ...  :(   ..  thanks 
,DDRobert,2010-12-24T01:47Z,"if you've updated to 3.50 to play, then download back to 3.41 to play jailbreaks, but that makes the purpose of downloading this in the first place m00t, unless you installed internally perhaps?"
,Zeroformer,2010-12-24T23:13Z,"YOU NEED THE 3.50 SPOOF FOR YOUR USB DONGLE TO PLAY IT. 
It will appear that you have got 3.50 but in fact you still have the 3.41.

Patch the game with Open Manager and load it with the backup manager"
,richto,2011-01-03T19:37Z,"Fixed EBOOT now released to play on 3.41. See PS Groove site for links.

This will NOT work with spoofing only."
,zzyuhh,2011-01-05T04:59Z,"This ISN'T yakusa 4 and yes, you can run it on 3.41 by replacing the eboot.bin by this one:"
,jamariob,2011-01-25T17:35Z,could you upload ps3 borderlands game of the year edition that comes with all 4 dlc plz 
,aj19morph,2011-01-27T14:38Z,Does this work on 3.55 Waninkoko?
,tkudam,2011-02-02T06:35Z,Working very well on 3.55 Kmeaw CFW.. thanks..
