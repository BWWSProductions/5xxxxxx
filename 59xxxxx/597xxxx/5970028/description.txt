Unreported World - India - Love on the Run  2010 11 19   Ch 4


As more young couples reject arranged marriages in modern India, Unreported World investigates a wave of violence that's left hundreds dead across the country's northwest states.

Reporter Annie Kelly and director Katherine Churcher reveal that, despite Indian law giving everyone the right to marry who they want, increasing numbers of young couples are facing death at the hands of their own families for defying centuries of tradition.

Despite the continuing murders, young couples are prepared to fight to be together, but falling in love in India can still be a very dangerous business.
