But once I stop it from updating and apply the crack the crack say ""Windows cannot access the speified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item."" I am running it as admin and it just shows a blank .exe basically, hope someone can help if not I'm fked"
,jefisthebest,2010-11-25T16:43Z, @thehidden656 can't you just use this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5111980/7Loader_1.6d_by_Hazar_[Jasper100]
,thehidden656,2010-11-25T19:28Z,"I'm gonna download that now and try it idk if it will help when I install the game, everything was fine all .exe's worked but when I did the crack the .exe game me that error but I'm downloading that loader now and I'll get back to you."
,jefisthebest,2010-11-25T19:45Z,"@ thehidden656:i'm sorry but i gave the wrong link,this is a good one:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5871663/test_drive_unlimited_beta_2_crack.. "
,thehidden656,2010-11-25T20:06Z,"Grrr I downloaded the other crack like you said and same error ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item."" It's not showing up as the testdrive2.exe it's jsut blank idk what the problem is oh well."
,thehidden656,2010-11-25T20:08Z,"Grr same error as other one ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item."" idk what the problem is."
,jefisthebest,2010-11-25T21:32Z,"@ thehidden656 Right Click on the file, go to properties, general tab. It will probably
say ""file has come from another computer and is being blocked"". Click the
unblock button and you should be ok."
,thehidden656,2010-11-25T21:54Z,@ jefisthebest Just right click and checked in properties doesn't say anything of that sort blocked or unblocked so I really have no clue at this point I've tried everything.
,jefisthebest,2010-11-26T13:09Z,"@ thehidden656: tutorial to take ownership of the file : http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1911-take-ownership-shortcut.html?ltr=T
IF that doesn't work, temporarily disable your antivirus or firewall."
,thehidden656,2010-11-26T18:44Z,Tried the ownership thing only worked for the .dll not the .exe and shut off antivirus and firewall and still either way same bs error I;m really at a loss of words at this point
,jefisthebest,2010-11-26T21:35Z,"@thehidden i'm sorry but i can't think about any solution for your problem,i've tested it on several computers(with several operating system)with absolutely no problem at all."
,thehidden656,2010-11-27T03:10Z,I tried it on my other computer that had win 7 and same bs idk what the problem is oh well. I guess I'll just wait till feburary
