A great gift book for any woman who wants to look sexy. I think this is a great informative book, that provides hundreds of useful fashion tips. How many times, haven't we seen someone dressed completely wrong for the occasion. I especially think it offers good advise for teens, who are always pushing their limits with what they wear. This book is well written, it provides easy instruction and can definately be used as a reminder of how we don't want to look in public.........
