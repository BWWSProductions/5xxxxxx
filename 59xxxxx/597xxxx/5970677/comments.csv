,bavage,2010-11-21T03:42Z,are you going to do any more outsourced episodes?

I really wish I could, but my extremely limited bandwidth is preventing me from it. It's hard to get the episodes out on time when your max dl speed is 33 kb/s.so, for the time being, I'll only be doing the 2 most popular shows, Chuck and The Office. If I get faster internet soon, I'll catch up on all the episodes that I missed. btw, you can stay updated on this news by following my twitter."
