Like I said just wanted to let you know if it matters to you as I would hate to see you waste your precious time with uploads/converting to movies already upped by Holyroses.

Keep up the great work OOO!"
[T],on.off.on,2010-11-22T06:26Z,holyroses uploads movies that ive uploaded before all the time.. so why not tell him the same? ;-)
,deftones69,2010-11-22T07:29Z,"Simply stated Holyroses uploads are of much greater quality, That is 1 of many reasons why. 
Please don't get me wrong, Your uploads are very good and your hard work is greatly appreciated but HR's uploads are the best of the best quality wise via the handheld format so there is no reason to upload something that has already been done by HR. As this has been discussed before, It may be hard to notice a difference in video quality on a 2 inch screen but many of us view these via different methods such as ps3, ipod/iphone to tv via a/v cable etc. and that is where the difference lies. 

You may beat holyroses to the punch so to speak regarding new releases as you upload them with the quickness which should be applauded but if you haven't noticed HR doesn't mess with screeners,r5's and rarely even dvd rips. HR waits for the available source to be 1080p rips 95% of the time (Inception being the last one that I can remember that the source was simply a dvd rip). So that is the reason you find so called duplicates of your uploads. 

Not at all trying to come off as a dick as I was only trying to inform you that this particular trilogy had already been done and was just trying to save you the time and effort. If anyone else other than HR (or PT) uploaded it in the past I would not have mentioned it as YOURS would in fact be an upgrade over anyone else.

Your 1 of 3 people along with holyroses and poppedtart (The Day Walker is making great strides also) that I even consider downloading on the entire net when it comes to movies/tv shows in ipod format. 

Anyways keep up the great work, as you are appreciated. And for the record Holyroses is a female just to let you know. :)

[T],qwersd,2010-11-22T09:46Z,"@deftones69 come on dude OOO is selflessly releasing movies for us & u should be thank full, rather than criticizing him for doing stuff that HR already did.. it's completely his wish what he wishes 2 upload & if u already have HR's file, don't download this, & this is probably better quality considering that this is ripped from 1080p & HR's are from 720p.. & this is better seeded..."
[T],on.off.on,2010-11-22T13:08Z,@deftones69 reading this makes me want to stop.. why should i do this for free for you guyz. All I get from it is one or 2 persons saying thanks... I cant make rips like holyroses... and btw poppedtart and holyroses is the same person any moron can see that lol but i dont really get what ur saying cuz u piss on me and then u say that i should keep up the good work? To be honest its comments like that makes me want to stop.. I make movies for handheld devices and nothing else! I dont recomment my releases on tv and yes HR/PT are better on a big screen. but on a handheld.. no way u can tell the difference...
,athiest09,2010-11-25T04:21Z,Guy's come on. We just get free stuff's because he like's contributing to us! how many of them ready to do that? May be ONLY FEW! BUT SOME PERSON'S make it  Beyond counties and beyond languages! Don't make him to feel that way.
