,zzcookiemonster,2011-01-06T06:38Z," @xXReasonsLeagueXx

you dont need a 5 gb dvd, the whole 5 gb include a 32 bit OS and a 64 bit OS, you only need to burn the one right for ur comp on to a cd to boot. you dont need the whole 5 GB worth. if ur not sure which is right for you, just google your processor and the brand company will tell you its designated OS. ie  Intel (r) dual core is a 64 bit OS, and anything higher in Intel hard ware is a 64 bit.

There are two activators in the torrent, just extract, and run one, if that one doesn't work, try the other.
