,geospider,2011-04-26T15:53Z,"Not sure if this is the one I downloaded, it's the same size. It played in espanol. I don't speak spanish.

It has an English soundtrack as well, but my T.V won't let me change sound tracks.

Soulation use mkvmerge GUI and uncheck the first sound track and save to a new file name and it will play in english. "
