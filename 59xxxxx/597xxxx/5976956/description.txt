What Does the Digital You Look Like? 
What you read ??? Where you shop ??? How you communicate with coworkers, friends, and strangers ??? Whom you interact with on social networking sites . . . these are just a few of the things that make up the Digital You.
"The Digital You is a complex mosaic of habit, subconscious acts of both omission and commission, and premeditated presentations. It is how our peers and friends, bosses and family actually experience us, as ever more of our lives in the real world takes place in the digital one. The purpose of this book and the associated software . . . is to help you begin to experience your Digital You in the same way that everyone around you does." -- From e-Habits, by Elizabeth Charnock
For the millions of people like us whose lives are increasingly lived online, E-Habits is the first-ever digital image makeover guide that empowers you to present yourself in the best possible light with every electronic action--whether on the Internet or within your own organization. Elizabeth Charnock, a pioneer in the field of digital evidence analytics, reveals what everyday activities??â€looking for a job, applying for a loan, searching for romance, e-mailing coworkers??â€tell others about us. By showing what you can do to assess and control the information about you that's "out there," Charnock outlines the steps you can take right now to ensure that the Digital You--the image of yourself that you present online--is the best representation of your values, your work, yourself.
