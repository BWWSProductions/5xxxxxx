Allmusic Review:
Originally released as a Hallmark exclusive for the holiday season of 2008, Home for Christmas was expanded by a single cut for its exclusive 2010 for Target: â€œLong Road Home,â€ taken from Sheryl Crowâ€™s fine 2010 tribute to Southern soul, 100 Miles from Memphis. This may be a secular tune, but it fits snugly next to the rest of Home for Christmas, as that holiday record was designed as a slow, soulful stroll through seasonal classics, Crow turning in excellent versions of tunes as diverse as â€œGo Tell It on the Mountain,â€ â€œThe Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire),â€ and â€œIâ€™ll Be Home for Christmas.â€ Crow doesnâ€™t necessarily reinvent these songs -- â€œMerry Christmas Babyâ€ is taken at a slightly faster gait than usual, â€œWhite Christmasâ€ grooves like classic Stax -- but she does inhabit them and her band is tight and dexterous, giving this Christmas album some unexpected and welcome soul. Itâ€™s a good enough holiday album that it shouldnâ€™t be thought of as a thrown-off exclusive: itâ€™s one of the better pop Christmas records of the last half of the 2000s.
