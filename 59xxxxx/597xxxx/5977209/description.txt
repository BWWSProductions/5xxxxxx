Cowboy Bebop (ã‚«ã‚¦ãƒœãƒ¼ã‚¤ãƒ“ãƒãƒƒãƒ— KaubÅi Bibappu?) is an influential, critically-acclaimed, and award-winning 1998 Japanese anime series directed by ShinichirÅ Watanabe, written by Keiko Nobumoto, and produced by Sunrise. It is one of the most highly acclaimed anime series ever created and it is the highest rated anime series on IMDB.

Its 26 episodes ("sessions") comprise a complete storyline: set in 2071, the series follows the misadventures and tragedies of a group of bounty hunters, or "cowboys", traveling on their spaceship, the Bebop.
The series' art direction centers around American music and counterculture, especially the beat and jazz movements of the 1940s-60s and the early rock era of the 1950s-70s, which the original soundtrack by Yoko Kanno and The Seatbelts recreates.[2]

Cowboy Bebop was a commercial success both in Japan and international markets, notably in the United States. After this reception, Sony Pictures released a feature film, Knockin' on Heaven's Door (2003), to theaters worldwide and followed up with an international DVD release. Two manga adaptations were serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's Asuka Fantasy DX.
