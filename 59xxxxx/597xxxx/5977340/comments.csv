The fed was never a secret, Lincoln and Kennedy fought against the fed etc.  Good beginners exploit, but it was so corny that at one point I expected He-Man to show up.  But keep up the torrents Cold, got some good stuff in there."
,some-young-guy,2010-11-23T06:22Z,"Many of today's leading researchers expose themselves to a very limited set of facts and conclude an entire position based on a very limited amount of intelligence.  Not to mention that many people distort the facts to support their opinion rather than allow their opinion to be swayed by the facts.

I will D/L, watch and seed this, but I'm pretty sure that it is also way off base from what really is what.  Thanks for the share mate."
