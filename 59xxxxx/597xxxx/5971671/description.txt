just loader&activators of mine

IMPORTANT

LOADER.EXE IS NOT PICKED UP BY ANY ANTIVIRUS AS FAR AS I KNOW

VISTA ACTIVATOR.EXE IS NORMALLY UNDETECTED BUT SOMETIMES IS BY SOME SCANNERS

WINDOWS 7,XP, VISTA ACTIVATOR [THUMPER]IS ALMOST ALWAYS DETECTED BY ALL SCANNERS




IMPORTANT IMPORTANT

THEY ARE FALSE POSITIVE SO IGNORE THEM THEY ARE DETECTED BECAUSE THEY USE DOS (COMMAND) TO MOD WINDOWS AND SORTA QUOTA FIX UP THE ACTIVATION TO BE BLANK QUOTA
