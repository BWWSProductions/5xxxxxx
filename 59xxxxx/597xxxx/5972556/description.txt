Slate Monkeys 
Set in the post industrial landscape of disused Welsh slate quarries, three very different climbers battle their way up some unusual climbing. Matt Segal, Hazel Findlay and Johnny Dawes take it in turn to crimp, palm, squirm and wriggle their way up the esoteric route, Gin Palace. But whose technique will prove successful?

Single-Handed 
Winner of 'People's Choice' and 'Best Climbing Film' at the Edinburgh Mountain Film Festival

The film exposes Kevin's motivations and follows his progression through the climbing grades, culminating in a gripping and palm-sweating attempt to solo E6 in Glen Nevis.

Little Big-Walling in Madagascar 
The West Face of Karimbony in the Tsaranoro Massif is home to one of the world's hardest big-wall free climbs, "Tough Enough?". James McHaffie and a team of top UK climbers head to Madagascar to find out if this route is indeed tough enough.
