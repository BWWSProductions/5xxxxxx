,afifi97,2010-12-12T19:11Z,Can anyone upload The Passing and The Sacrifice Map ?
,mathx,2010-12-14T12:50Z,Thanks If I have any problems I'll come back.
,Sublime570,2010-12-17T18:59Z,Hmm. It Downloaded fine. But anything i click on to run it just receives an error. Also my virus protection detected a trojan in it. 
,Pattsatt,2011-01-16T19:58Z,well it's a direct play torrent u guys don't need install anything it should just be to close steam and click on play...
,Ramb082,2011-01-30T00:38Z,"Ok I just want to say a couple of things... First Thanks for the torrent it works fine, people are missing a few things. You have to run left 4 dead 2 with steam once then close the game and run it without steam... For all the people who can't ""install it"" There is no install file, Read the description DIRECT PLAY means no install... Use Winrar or 7zip and extract all the files to a folder u want the game in."
,Ramb082,2011-01-30T00:45Z,"Also alot of people complain about the ""No gore"" system. That is soo easy to avoid... Go into your left 4 dead 2 folder and open steam_appid.txt    Change the value from whatever is there to 510.... Soooo if you open the text file and it says 590 or something, delete that and make sure only the numbers 510 are in there ok noobs??? Also you have to change another value to 510.... Open this folder...     C:programfiles/left4dead2/left4dead2         Now open the text file called     steam...     change the Appid to 510... Voila all should be gory, Zombies will spew blood, limbs will be severed etc. etc.  Have fun guys :D"
,connect2air,2011-01-31T20:13Z,"Hi, the readme file under ""addons"" says to put all the .VPK Files in the folder to install it, but when i did so, the game would not start. Can i please get help anyone??"
,psl007,2011-02-02T20:41Z,WARNING! Trojan detected in razor1911.exe. Kaspersky cured it.  
,Ramb082,2011-02-08T04:11Z,"@connect2air... The vpk files are map files, now I haven't installed skins or scripts for L4D2 but my maps that I downloaded worked fine. For skins there's usually instructions on how to install them, usually you have to go into the skins folder in left 4 dead 2 and copy the skins there. Only maps go in the addons folder. Try running it through steam first or try googling it.. Google knows all :D people underestimate it haha. Also @psl007 and for everyone else the reason most cracks say they are trojan is because what a crack is trying to remove the need for a disc. A trojan tends to fuck your compter up pretty bad such as turning your computer off, removing keyboard access, finding and deleting files such as system32. Never have I had a problem with game cracks because I always buy applications like windows 7, microsoft word and never trust free antivirus's they get access to your whole computer files because you let it... Hope this helps everyone and thanks for the epic torrent."
,konykRo,2011-03-04T01:47Z,nice man thanks a lot you rock :D
,RoninVamp,2011-03-23T20:52Z,"The first time I started it up it was fine, now its in Russian, what happened?"
,MIXBMX123,2011-04-02T00:22Z,it does work fine but why is the audio in russian?
,luxar1226,2011-04-04T08:54Z,anyone know how to make it multiplayer? plz respond
,Peskunid,2011-04-10T19:06Z,is the online playing playable???
,art00rz,2011-04-29T23:00Z,"single player works fine, but how can i play online?"
,Charred13,2011-06-22T21:18Z,"Okay, this does not include any DLC.
For me the LAN wouldn't work which is a shame since me and a few college mates were trying to play it together...
I doubt you could get it to play online unless perhaps you use cracked servers such as Garena (very good, plenty of players)
Seems to only work on single player (survival wont work, didn't try scavenge since it sucks with just 1 player)"
,Charred13,2011-06-22T21:19Z,"Oh yeah and just to add, your AV will probably detect an anti-virus, this is a false positive and will not harm your PC...even if the 'virus' file does get deleted you can still play the game."
