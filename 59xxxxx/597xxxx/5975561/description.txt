\"Brian Writes a Bestseller\"

Feeling discouraged with the progress of 
his writing career, Brian decides to throw 
in the towel until Stewie becomes his 
manager and one of his books hits the 
bestseller list. But when the fame goes to 
his head, Brian gets a wake-up call from 
Bill Maher (guest-voicing as himself). 
Meanwhile, Lois decides that she and Peter 
need separate beds, a decision that leaves 
Peter looking for a new cuddle buddy.

There is 5 minutes of live-action footage
in this episode that is actually 30fps.
Being that this was 25% of the episode, we
felt it would be beest to leave it all at
30 and not incur any jerky playback during
the live action footage. No ghosting or
jerky playback results in the remaining
75% either.

Enjoy
