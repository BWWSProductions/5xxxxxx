,sirvondutch,2010-12-01T14:41Z,"Nice up, but unplayable on PS3 (and some BR-players) due to audio watermarking.

This torrent has the Cinavia DRM Protection in it! When played through for example a PS3, you will find yourself completely fucked when the audio will stop after about 10 to 20 minutes and the cinavia protection message will be displayed.

,imnangler,2010-12-02T00:28Z,"There are no subs for the Asians but that's only in the very beginning of the movie. There is no copy protection, or I experienced none with the ps3 media server. Audio and video are great. If you want to enjoy this movie switch your brains to off...and even then I bet it still sucks."
,F4W4D,2010-12-03T12:47Z,"this movie isn't slated yet to be in bluray till December 28th ??, so.."

,CakeMonster,2010-12-17T18:32Z,"IF it freezes for you in VLC player try Splash lite player, sometimes on some computers vlc player has problem with 1080 format"
,561Hero,2010-12-19T21:07Z,Can we get some more confirmation on whats the deal with the audio?
,CakeMonster,2010-12-20T21:10Z,"There is no problem with the audio

If you are having problem with your audio it is most likely your computer or your player there is a problem with

And Again There are several players out there

VLC is very popular but sometimes has a problem with the 1080p format but not with the audio, windows mediaplayer has problem with everything all the time in all ways

And splash lite player can often handle the 1080p format better than VLC player"

,oshaugh2209,2010-12-29T07:58Z,"I downloaded XMBC, but I can't get it to find any of the other movies I've downloaded..Boondock saints and Greenstreet Hooligans..Do I have to burn the images to a dvd in order for XMBC to recognize? It won't recognize the movies when I browse to their directory"
,oshaugh2209,2010-12-29T09:53Z,I also mount a different movie iso with poweriso and xbmc still tells me to insert the disk
