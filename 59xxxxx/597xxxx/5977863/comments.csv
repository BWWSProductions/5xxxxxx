,AmbitzGFX,2011-03-15T15:58Z,Well this is going to be confusing but. The program is indeed there! But there is a trojan. If you have a good AV It will block the trojan and you can continue on using the program!! If anybody wants some information on then trojan then just say here!

Put the PS.8bf file into the plugins directory. Zaxweks opens from the filter drop-down. After that, I don't know."
