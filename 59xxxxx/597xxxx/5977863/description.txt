The 3D Invigorator PRO for After Effects plug-in has once again proven to be the must-have software of the year. Already known as the industry standard 3D graphics power house, version 4 adds many new capabilities which appeal to the artistic side of graphics design, as well as adding new tools that appeal to the motion graphic artist who must create large numbers of graphics on impossible deadlines. 

These new features unlock a whole different way of using 3D as a design tool and will be sure to inspire an evolution in animated motion graphics.
