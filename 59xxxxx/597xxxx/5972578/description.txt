E.S. Posthumus Discography - Flac

Artist info
E.S. Posthumus is a music group that produces cinematic style music. It is a form of epic classical that fuses intertwined drum beats with orchestral and electronic sounds. Their music is inspired by the Pythagorean Philosophy which states that "music is the harmonization of opposites; the conciliation of warring elements." The "E.S." stands for "Experimental Sounds" or "Electronic Sounds" while "Posthumus" is said to represent "all things past".

The group was formed in 2000 by brothers Helmut Vonlichten and Franz Vonlichten. Born and raised in Los Angeles, Helmut and Franz studied piano with their mother. After graduating from high school Franz worked in recording studios while Helmut attended and graduated from UCLA with a degree in archaeology.

Their music has been licensed by every major film and TV studio. They also composed the song Posthumus Zone for the CBS Sports TV programs The NFL Today and The NFL on CBS.
