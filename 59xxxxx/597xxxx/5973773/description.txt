Wakka. Wakka. Wakka. The "Pac" is back to celebrate his 30th birthday with Pac-Man Party. The game combines traditional franchise elements with multiplayer sensibilities to bring a dynamic party game filled with zany mini-games and challenges. Utilizing the Wii Remote, the game's easy to pick-up-and-play controls will have players using their skills and reflexes to compete against one another as they move about several unique virtual game boards. Adding a bit of retro flavor, PAC-MAN Party will also feature a Classic mode where players can kick it like it was the 1980's and experience the original arcade versions of Pac-Man, Galaga and Dig-Dug.
