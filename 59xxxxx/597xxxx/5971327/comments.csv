2. Is there any way this might be available for Mac?

3. Generally speaking, I think Mac is the preferred format fore music apps.

Thanks again"

,me_101,2011-01-28T14:33Z,"Ok. I downloaded it and I'm seeding.
Now what do I do? This will probably need some crack or serial nos. or something. I know it's a plugin. I'm using Adobe Audition. 
I'm a noob. Sorry."

[V],DeGun,2011-03-30T16:16Z,"Hi every 1 , so first how to : 

 In case the Plugins don't show up in your VSTPlugins list Google for Microsoft's free Visual C++ Runtimes:          
vcredist 2005 SP1 and vcredist 2008 sp1   Install these runtimes, reboot and rescan your plugs .

Otherwise i have uploaded some mac plugins if you like ... check my last torrents !

,destroyer8000,2012-03-21T03:55Z,"Problem:

I am using the plug-in on Adobe Audition CS5.5 with Windows Vista Ultimate 64 bit.

I have installed other Antares products, but with this one, I go to the effects panel;
VST/Other/Antares Audio Technologies

But both AVOX ARTICULATOR and Harmony Engine are both grayed out.

Anyone else? Got solutions? "
