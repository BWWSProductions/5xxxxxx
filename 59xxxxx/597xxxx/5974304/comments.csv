,PhilLesh12,2010-11-22T08:08Z,"Yeah, well, since you are actually commenting, you're not acting like the typical torrent spammer.

I guess you are who you are and not a hacked account.

Besides, you didn't suddenly upload 30 torrents, like the typical spammer.

It just seemed strange that you hadn't upped in 14 months.  I think you know what I mean."
