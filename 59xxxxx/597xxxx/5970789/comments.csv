,gmjh,2010-12-08T01:46Z,Amazing. I've downloaded at least 50 HD films and the quality of this one is by far the best I've ever seen. Even though it's half the size of the usual 5-7 GB blocky pixelated files I normally see. Have you got a mailing list of people keeping up to date with what you put out? I want to be on it.

Quality is EXCELLENT.
Don't know how you do it but I am impressed, especially with the small file sizes.

And thanks for Breaking Bad Season 3 and Dexter Season 5. Once again, I don't know how you do it but I'm grateful.

Thanks and keep up the great work."
