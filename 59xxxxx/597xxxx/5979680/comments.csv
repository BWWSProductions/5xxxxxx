Ally and Horde Dailies

Ally and Horde WoTLK leveling guides

maybe I'm missing something?"
,svetlania09,2010-11-23T22:38Z,"@ic3warm, the WOTLK leveling guides include everything from 1-80.  Blizz has dramatically changed the way we level.  You can now get from 1-60 on one continent (Kalimdor or Eastern Kingdoms) so it includes the new 1-60 guides for each of the continents, your choice of which one.  Of course, the 80-85 stuff isn't available until 12/7 so Zygor will probably have a new guide out then.  This release will get your new Gnome Druid off the ground right...  I'll post new guides as they become available."
,svetlania09,2010-11-23T22:43Z,"@ic3warm, the WOTLK leveling guide files include 1-80.  Of course Cata content will not be released until 12/7 so those guides aren't available yet.  This includes the new quest changes and change of zones due to the Shattering."

,combs000,2010-11-25T13:47Z,Are you going to upload 80-85? Thanks!~
,svetlania09,2010-11-25T14:39Z,"@chr1111z, Thank goodness for knowing someone on the Zygor Team!  Here is the 2.0.1516 update. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5984726"
,svetlania09,2010-11-25T14:40Z,"@combs000, the 80-85 guides should be released around the same time as Cata hits the shelves.  If I get the guides then, I will be more than happy to post them."
