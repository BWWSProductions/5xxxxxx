,lilars26,2010-11-23T18:28Z,Thanks 20-40.Sorry about all the tight fisted people who don't give a shit about the ones in poorer countries.My gun is locked and loaded and I call him Karma.
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-23T19:12Z,"Thanks.

@doyll: There is no need, I explained why is such thing bad and I always have advised against. Keep seeding back as much as you took (1.0084 ratio if you can) - and unload the torrent after two days. People on  slow connections will finish download by then... others must learn just to stuff their mouths only as much as they can swallow.

After 24h - in world of TV packs - starts Halloween - only bloodsucking bastards and come'n'goers would come - if missed they favored show by day - true fans know where they should be looking for. Not here, this is not the place for that... I don't want that. 

They suck dry (deplete) seeders seeding back - zero. Next week they happy go direction [eztv] where such behaviour is tolerated, even promoted by.

 I have 20-30 seeders max,  and these are same people, always. I know all of them...

Listen, I am here for people who cannot seed back - because with 10 kB/s or less prevent that - and I am willing to step in - for those... but - I want not to be ass-raped by guys WHO CAN DOWNLOAD WITH 1000 OR 6000 Kb/s and seed shit back - inventing excuses (and I hear them all) for being shitheaded hardfisting bastard."

thanx a tonne in advance...

reply soon...."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-23T19:46Z,@ar1990: I cannot.
,DSIN,2010-11-23T19:54Z,"@twentyforty : u r right... tpb is gr8 site for hit & runners as there is no such thing as ratio here... 
thats y i asked u abt demonoid... i think u shld just post ur torrents there... like u did months ago... believe it or not...only 1 of them is dead.. & some r still well seeded :D
just for the record i do seed watever i take till i giv 100% back... or i atleast try. with my 512 k bw(dl = ul = 70ksmax).. still seeding ur juno.. 'll try to do it till 1 but looks like the seeders r having no problem seeding this file as the file is being seeded with up speed only 2.7k ."
,abj642,2010-11-23T19:55Z,thanks 20-40
,lilars26,2010-11-23T21:11Z,"@all
The reason 20-40 is here and not on Demonoid is because on Demonoid the downloaders have to maintain a 1-1 ratio.20-40 is uploading for the people who cannot maintain such a ratio.(thru no fault of their own)That is why he likes to use the smaller file size as well.We,as downloaders
can help his mission by seeding as much as we are able.This is why he tells anyone who doesn't want to seed ""The internet is a big place and people can go elsewhere"" He was only on Demonoid when TPB was down.
@20-40 If I have not explained this properly then please correct me."
,djwasif,2010-11-23T21:27Z,@ 20-40  I understand what u r trying to say and i respect u for that.... unfortunately i am one of those people with a slow internet connection.... avg only around 20kb/s.... u have no idea how ur small sized uploads is helping me at the moment :) :)
,jon4fun,2010-11-24T00:02Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode(s)/upload.

Cheers

@ All H&R fuckheads - you have been warned!"
,ama332,2010-11-24T02:04Z,Thanks for Futurama and HIMYM. Always the best.
,madtown4,2010-11-24T07:06Z,"today for me and yesterday for you somebody put out TAKERS  and said it was a scr....well from all the comments i read, It seems to be a TS. well i was wondering if you checked out Takers 2010 PPVRip-IFLIX  ....just wondering ......well good night my friend and good morning for you..lol.."
,rojenatgmail,2010-11-24T10:26Z,"Thanks for Chuck, Futurama, HIMYM and Two and a Half Men."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-24T10:51Z,"@madtown4: It's probably TC, some copy for people who make subtitles.
LOL, probably they got it as burned on DVDR - therefore usual encoders slash morons call that crap ""DVDSCR"".
By that logic - when we burn some CAM on empty DVD and convert it to XviD two days later - it becomes DVDrip (ROFL).

However, its by miles better than any copy of Takers so far (I know - I downloaded all so far and tried to watch). I encoded one 352p and it should be in ""Takers-The.Last.Exorcism.SCR.352p.and.3x.272p.H264[CHOOSE].torrent"" later today, my night-time and your dawn tomorrow."
