MY WARNINGS GAVE NO RESULTS WHATSOEVER.

Last four days number of pure Hit and Runs 
(seeding back under 0.4 is considered Hit&Run too)
rose up to unbelievable, unseen, intolerable 98.8 percent!

DO ANY OF YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
Anyone who think that he screwed ME up - is insane.
Only poor and deprived get screwed. Not me.
I have the files already, right?

So... Morons United (normal people should stop reading now)
get the fuck out of here! Do NOT load my torrents. DO NOT.

Consider yourself as animals and HUNTING SEASON started right now !!!
Expect unexpected.
