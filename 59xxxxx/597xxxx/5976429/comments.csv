And RIP Secret_Myth indeed! :(

Just cus people here on tpb are idiots, cant appreciate things they get for free, and even COMPLAINING about the stuff and the people that get them this for free... fucking idiots, things like this do make me too never up load a torrent again, so I do understand why they stopped sadly.. "

(If I'm not blind and do not see it, pardon then!)
Make it much easier to get right subtitles in other languages for example!

Thanks again! :)"

A:9/10 (bit low standard, no big problem ofc)
V:  ~8/10 (for a BRRip, compared to dvd its 10/10, but I compare to ""standard for bluray rip, since that's what it is)

 A bit too pixelated on some spot so that is makes it look like ""ants"" moving around on especially things out of focus, not a big issue, but something to think about for next rip.
M: 8/10. A bit clichĂÂŠd and the screen play, not the best, but over and all a movie well worth watching, download!

Thanks!"
