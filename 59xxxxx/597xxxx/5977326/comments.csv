[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-23T02:08Z,If your ATV is frame skipping it is probably overheating.  I recently switched from a glass to a wood entertainment console and my ATV gets way hot and was frame skipping.  I now have it on a 20 disc cd spindle and its running fine.  I could probably elevate it with like a stack of 5 quarters in each corner as well.  Just something to keep it elevated so it can dissipate.  Was wondering if putting it on tin foil would do anything.  its like 20 degrees cooler now.

[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-23T15:34Z,apple tv 4.1 firmware is out.  any reports on playback issues with user generated content?
,johnnyapplec,2010-11-23T16:50Z,no issues here...actually watched scott pilgrim without one glitch over streaming! ;)
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-23T17:03Z,"wifi or lan?  any new features?  See if subtitles have been fixed.  I noticed issues where if you have subtitle enabled there is an overlay issue where the overlay remains on screen but no words are present.  only fix is to turn off subs, restart movie, turn on subs."
,johnnyapplec,2010-11-23T17:50Z,streaming over wifi without issues...love the new airplay feature! Can push content from Mac or IOS device.  Seems that the blank subtitle issues is still there.  I hope that hulu gets next update!  Also like old ATV 1 interface better.
