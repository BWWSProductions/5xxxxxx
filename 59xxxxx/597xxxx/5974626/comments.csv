,DxDawgg,2010-11-22T13:21Z,wtf does repack mean where in the hell is the damn avi format 550 mb upload this shit is like a gb and a half for an hour long show like wtf?
,metalkiwi,2010-11-22T14:25Z,"I added this using the magnet link on EZTV and have so far gotten almost nothing, not even 1MB in 5 hours? Hey DxDawgg, the reason it's a gig and a half is because it's 720p HD and high quality with surround sound. What were you expecting it to be? 350MB?? Pfft."
,metalkiwi,2010-11-22T14:36Z,"DxDawgg, it's 1.5GB due to being a high quality, 720p HD file with surround sound. What were you expecting, for it to be 350MB? Pfft."
,cheo2010,2010-11-22T17:43Z,Thanks.
,terrapin2,2010-11-22T20:02Z,"To DxDawgg:
Whatever happened to gratitude you ignorant scumbag?!
If it's too big for you, go download a smaller one, but don't come up in here talking like it's OWED to you or something!
KIDS like you is what's wrong with the world!
Oh and by the way.....GO FUCK YOURSELF"

,293837,2010-11-28T10:13Z,I cant say if this file is good or not. Makes miro player freeze up and not respond. File will not play. waste of my time. thanks
,293837,2010-11-28T10:44Z,update- file works fine had to download VLC player to get it to play. Thanks
,bradass,2010-11-29T04:06Z,"what are you all watching this on?  the computer or converting it to play in blu-ray player?  i would need a 50 ft cord to hook to my tv, so, does this convert without errors?  is my real question i guess.

anyone converting? or should i download the smaller one to play in divx/mpeg-4 dvd player.

seems a waste of a download for me to have to watch it on my computer monitor.

noticed all the arguing so i figured everyone wants it in different formats for different reasons, so, if anyone converting for blu-ray player let me know if you had errors. i always get errors when the movie has the AAC audio.

and thanks eztv, always solid."
