Amazon Description:
Traditional holiday favorites alongside gorgeous, lesser-known discoveries, all imbued with Pink Martini s signature little orchestra sound! Features an array of guests, including Japanese pop star Saori Yuki and NPR correspondent Ari Shapiro, backed by a fabulous gathering of Portland choirs. This new CD features gorgeous 3-D packaging each layer of buildings will be a separate flap, giving the city four layers of die-cut depth. The digipak will be covered by a clear plastic panel, on which the album title will be printed, along with delicate white snowflakes that will appear to float in front of the city. 

Allmusic Review:
Just when it feels like every possible version of every possible holiday song has been recorded already, Pink Martiniâ€™s Joy to the World finds ways to revive holiday spirits. While the band could very easily do a swanky lounge-pop album of the seasonâ€™s songs, this globally minded collection is traditional and unpredictable at the same time. Pink Martini begins Joy to the World with an intimate rendition of â€œWhite Christmasâ€ thatâ€™s so faithful to the original that it features the sunny California prelude that was included when it debuted in the film Holiday Inn, then they follow it with a lush orchestral rendition -- sung in Japanese. Yet quirks like these donâ€™t feel kitschy; aside from â€œSanta Baby,â€ Joy to the Worldâ€™s lone indulgence in camp, the album sings of peace and celebration in many tongues. Whether they give â€œLittle Drummer Boyâ€'s arrangement a Middle Eastern-meets-lounge twist or sing â€œSilent Nightâ€ in German, Arabic, and English, Pink Martini ensures this is truly a multicultural party. The group even makes fresh choices for Hanukkah and New Yearâ€™s, presenting the conclusion of the Amidah prayer set to music (â€œElohai, Nâ€™tzorâ€) and â€œOcho Kandelikas,â€ a Sephardic song sung in Ladino. â€œCongratulations,â€ a song for the Chinese New Year, is such a breath of fresh air compared to â€œAuld Lang Syneâ€ that itâ€™s easy to forget that this song would normally be heard in late January or early February instead of the end of December. And when â€œAuld Lang Syneâ€ arrives with an arrangement inspired by Brazilian Carnaval music, it sends off the album, and the year, with a huge celebration. A near-perfect blend of spirituality and festivity, Joy to the World lets listeners hear the holidays with new ears, and maybe see it with fresh eyes, too.
