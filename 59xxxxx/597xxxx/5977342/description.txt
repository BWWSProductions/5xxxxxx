Panchang
This CD provides a complete Hindu Panchang for the period 2000-2010. You can find the Indian, Solar, Tamil and Lunar dates and the Paksham. You can note the Tithi, Nakshatra, Yogam and Karana prevailing and their end timings. The Panchang also tells you if the day is auspicious or not â€“ the Amruthathi yogas for the day are noted. Festivals and events for the day are displayed. The Rahu and other Kala timings are calculated taking into account the latitude of the city selected are listed. The sunrise/set and moonrise/set timings for the day can be seen. With the click of a button you can view the Nirayana Ephemeris for the day and also the Lagna start times. You can switch to any other date and instantly and view the Panchang for that day. You can set the panchang for the city of your choice.
This Panchang is `Drigh Ganithâ€™ and is based on modern astronomy with ayanamsa adjustment. Chitra Paksh (also called Lahiri) ayanamsa has been used.
The Panchang may differ from Panchangs based on Surya Siddhanth, Arya Siddhanth  or  Vakya systems. It corresponds to the Rashtriya Panchang published by the Positional Astronomy Centre, MET Dept., Govt. of India.
The Indian Day is reckoned from sunrise to sunrise.
The Panchang also provides browsing facility for Dates, Tithies & Stars, Shub Muhurtha dates, Amruthathi Yogas and Festivals. You can view any of these over a period by setting the â€˜Fromâ€™ and â€˜Toâ€™ dates.
Solar and Lunar eclipse databases can be viewed separately. `Panchang Glossaryâ€™ tells you all about the Panchang and the terminology. A complete `Festival Glossaryâ€™ has been included . `Eclipse Glossaryâ€™ gives you an overview about Solar and Lunar Eclipses. Fred Espenakâ€™s (NASA) Solar and Lunar Eclipse predictions are included with due acknowledgment. A bibliography is also available.
Panchang for the period 1902 â€“ 1999 is abridged. You can view the various dates, tithies and stars. It provides a quick accurate back reference. `ReadmeFirstâ€™ provides help for using the Panchang.
The Panchang uses Windows Worpad.exe to display RTF format text files. The program assumes that the location of the wordpad.exe is as under:
	C:\Program Files\Acessoreis\Wordpad.exe - Windows 98 location
	C:\Program files\Windows NT\Acessories\Wordpad.exe - Windows XP location
In case, the files like `ReadmeFirstâ€™, do not display, please check the location of the Wordpad.exe file in your computer and re-locate the file to any of the 2 locations given above which are the normal location of the Wordpad.exe file.
Aldasa - Dasas/Bukthis/Antarams
The ALDASA program tabulates Dasas, Bukthis and Antarams from the current date. Dasas have been calculated on the basis of 365.2422 days a year. Because of rounding of the dates, a difference of one or 2 days may be noticed between ending of Dasas, Bukthis and Antarams. This difference is not important astrologically. 
The tabulation covers the period up to an age of 100. If a person is 80 and starts the program, he will get results for the next 20/25 years. If the program is initiated when a child is born, dasas, bukthis and antarams will be tabulated for about 100 years. The results are saved in a `Textâ€™ file and the location is given. The results can be perused at any time by finding the file using the Windows Explorer and double clicking the file icon. It can also be printed completely or portions can be printed selectively.
ReadmeFirst 
All the Programs contain a `ReadmeFirstâ€™ button. Please read this first for guidance and help.
