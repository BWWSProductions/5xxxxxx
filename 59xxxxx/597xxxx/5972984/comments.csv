,BasilBrush,2010-11-22T17:36Z,"I did some of the Nordic last year but there didn't seem to be much interest - same with the bobsleigh, luge and skeleton. The problem is that Eurosport have two channels (1 and 2) and I can only capture one channel. I'll probably be doing the IBU Biathlon but sometimes this clashes with the FIS Cross Country - they sometimes have them on at the same time on Eurosport 1 and 2 so then it's a case of looking for a repeat of the IBU or FIS race which sometimes isn't repeated. If it is repeated the programme is usually an edited version."
,BasilBrush,2010-11-22T17:45Z,"I tried playing these MP4 files on a Samsung N130 netbook with N270 Atom 1.6GHz processor under Windows FLP.

There's no problem with VLC or MPC-HC (with ffdshow and Haali) but Quicktime isn't so good.

Quicktime has a real problem when run on an Atom processor. The video is staggered. It looks like every other frame is bypassed to allow Quicktime to keep up with real-time playback causing a staggered image. One of the threads is running near to 100%

There was no problem running these MP4 files under Quicktime on a faster PC.

The CPU usage of VLC 1.1.5 and MPC-HC 1.4.2499.0 (with ffdshow and Haali) is about 40% on the N270 processor.

You can get the latest MPC-HC, ffdshow and Haali from x264.nl"
