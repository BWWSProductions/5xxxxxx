this is a re-encode of the DMT upload, all kudos to them. personally I think full DVD iso take up to much space for a very small gain in quality.

encoded with handbrake, should work on any mac / pc with quicktime / itunes, else vlc will do.

more information on the movie can be found on the page of the original torrent:

Mammuth (2010) Roadmovie DD5.1 NLSubs-DMT

if you like the movie, buy it.
