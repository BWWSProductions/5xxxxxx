[H],HeroMaster,2010-11-20T19:15Z,"@Crazybaby it doesnt contain any malvare or virus, and there is no need for extracting, it is extracted and i have checked it,as it is working fine, disable your anti-Virus if you are having Problems."
,crazybaby,2010-11-20T19:57Z,"after clicking that patch exe , 10-15 sec later it restarted my pc instantly. And when i checked the file i saw its so. 

if its not a malware or anything sry for my previous posts. thx"
,iycgtptyarvg,2010-11-23T09:00Z,"After installing and starting the game I go to a login screen. If I click on 'Create account' then I'm taken to the BattleNet web-site. If I click on 'Play as guest' it tells me I need to create an account first.

Do I need to create an account to play?
If so, how?
If not, what do I need to do than? "
,ventura8,2010-12-10T17:00Z,"Hey man, don't download this, seconds after running the patch my pc restarted, and my PC could not boot anymore, to make my pc boot again i had to run the windows 7 instalation setup, go to repair, >in the system recovery options click command promt and type bootrec.exe, hit enter and use all the option.

,BoBiTy666,2010-12-19T08:06Z,"NOT WORKING!!!!WHEN YOU PRESS PLAY AS GUEST, IT REQUIRES ACCOUNT.NOT WORKING!!!!!"
,jeffabe3,2010-12-27T10:55Z,"Wow this worked perfectly for me!
No need for other programs like the SC2allinone.
Fully working Campaign and Skirmish modes on the game itself.

To everyone having problems this is how i did it:
1. Install a fresh copy of StarCraft II Wings of Liberty (Fresh install to remove all the previous cracks)
2. After installing stop the game from updating
3. Run SC2-1.1.3-enGB-patch from the download
4. Run Keygen as Administrator (THIS IS IMPORTANT TO GET THE GUEST ACCOUNT WORKING!)
   (To run as admin on XP simply shift+double click)
   Click OK then QUIT.
5. Run sc2_copy
6. To play the game, use the SC2Switcher.exe located at the install folder starcraftII>support to prevent the game from updating."
,tammttg,2010-12-31T17:52Z,"it works fine, but I had to run Keygen many times
thanks for sharing"
,xyborg,2011-01-30T10:50Z,It seems like this files are infected with the TDSS Rootkit (aka Alureon... a very naste bug) ... After installing my computer crashed instantly. You can use this tool to remove it.http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684
