An updated version of my old Pokemon Game OST collection(http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5712234/Pokemon_Game_OST_Collection). It has everything from that collection, along with the following changes:
-Added the tracks from the Black & White Super Music Collection. I also included a set of supplmental game tracks not found on the official OST; these tracks were collected by Quaqsireqing from the FFshrine forums.
-Replaced the gamerip HGSS OST with the official OST, & renamed and resorted tracks accordingly. Also added official album art.
