From Wiki:


Candlebox is a Rock band from Seattle, Washington. Formed in November 1990, the band originally went by the name Uncle Duke; they later changed their name, purportedly inspired by lyrics from the Midnight Oil song "Tin Legs and Tin Mines" from the album 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

The band was origninally started by Kevin Martin on lead guitar and vocals and Scott Mercado on drums. Later the two members added Peter Klett on guitar and Bardi Martin on bass.


Candlebox's musical style cannot be easily categorized, as their music has a wide range of influences. Some of their songs have strong references to blues, jazz, grunge, rock and even glam metal. Their music is unique in its style and rejects the strict format that most hard rock songs and artists stick to.[2] They offer a very complex outlook on music by creating their own unique style. Although it offers some classic roots mentioned previously like jazz and blues, their music is very contemporary. Candlebox borders "pop metal" or the typical metal style and Grunge.


Candlebox were occasionally looked down upon by members of the Grunge movement; they criticized Candlebox's style and image as being derivative of Grunge. One of these early detractors was Kurt Cobain of Nirvana.[4] Candlebox were regarded by promoters, fans, and record label executives as one of the few workhorse bands of the Seattle Scene; the band toured relentlessly and played the Seattle club circuit. Candlebox had the vigorous support of promoters and fans, and the band's persistence paid off when their self-titled debut was released in 1993. Candlebox sold more than 4 million copies of their debut which, after many months of gaining momentum, peaked at number 7 on Billboard's album charts. Their follow-up album, Lucy, was certified gold in 1996. Candlebox was the first successful act on Madonna's Maverick Records, which went on to sign Alanis Morissette, Deftones, and The Prodigy.








Candlebox 1993


Candlebox is the eponymous debut album of Seattle post-grunge band Candlebox. It contains their best known hit, "Far Behind," as well as the hit singles "You" and "Cover Me." The album was released in 1993 and has since been certified 4x Platinum in the United States. The cover art bares a striking similarity to that of the cover for the single "Beds Are Burning" by Midnight Oil, who also inspired the name "Candlebox."

The music videos for "Far Behind" and "You" remained in longstanding rotation on MTV and became two of the most requested videos of 1993.

Other songs were recorded during the Candlebox sessions and included on other releases. "Can't Give In," for instance, appears on the Airheads film soundtrack. "Pull Away" also served as a B-side to the "You" CD single.

Lucy 1995


Lucy was the follow-up to Candlebox's 1993 self-titled first album. "Simple Lessons" received considerable airplay, but this album did not fare as well as their first. A video was made for "Understanding" directed by filmmaker Gus Van Sant, featuring the band in water, as well as Kevin Martin singing the lyrics underwater. Early versions of "Understanding (Racially Motivated)" and "Bothered" were performed live in concert during their 1994 tour.
