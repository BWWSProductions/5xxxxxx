,QborT,2010-11-22T19:02Z,"tktorrents you don't know shit.  The reason EZTV hasn't uploaded this is because there isn't a ""scene release"".  This is a P2P release.

EZTV doesn't make the rips, they simply upload scene releases.  Fuckin n00bs should keep their mouths shut and fingers off the keyboards until they learn.

Good up vbazyl, thanks"
