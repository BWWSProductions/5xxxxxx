,jj423,2010-12-04T22:54Z,"obj126 is full of shit, you dont need an activation disk if your upgraded to ixtreme l.t. so maybe before trying to give advise, you yourself should get some??? google is your friend noobie.."
,Hails592,2011-01-04T18:12Z,"whatever.

ive got a flashed (since wave 3) samsung drive in my xbox360, i didnt need to have that reflashed for kinect. 
to play my kinect games i insert the wave 4 activation disc, play it, remove it when promted then i put in a burned kinect game and they work perfectly!! ive played wave 6/7 games with ap2.5 (assassins creed brotherhood) worked perfectly after i used the wave 4 activate.

my boyfriend on the other hand, has a flashed lite on drive in his xbox360 (which is pants..) which worked the same as mine until now, he needs to be reflash his, just because it doesnt work the same way as my samsung, just becuase its a ""lite on"" drive. 

""lite on"" drives are shit

oh and jj423, i use a WAVE 4 ACTIVATION DISC disc to LOAD my KINECT games and others such as ACB with AP2.5 on my SAMSUNG drive, so take my advice: go and suck on someone's big fat hairy dick you total bell end!"
,Hails592,2011-01-04T18:17Z,"almost forgot!!

thank you obj126 this game works great using my wave 4 activation disc :)"
,mugsy1063,2011-01-11T00:57Z,Can someone help me and explain to me how to convert the games to burn them and what programs to use for games. I can convert movies but do not know how to do games and desperately want this game. Thank you so much!!
,wingus87,2011-02-11T14:25Z,I have used 7z to unzip the files but it didnt unzip it into a ISO is there something else im ment to do
,shaneocuk,2011-04-02T02:49Z,"game is ripped wrong, you need the original xbox 360 game burner. can download it here, its the best one out there it works with every xbox 360 game. www.game-burner.com "
,jdilla12,2011-04-07T05:27Z,Burn it on lvl 3 check the adjust the ssv1 angle 359 for ixtreme 1.4
,mugsy1063,2011-04-09T03:56Z,"Thank you all for your help, I appreciate it more than you know!!"
,iraqi1998_m,2011-04-22T23:09Z,why does everyone compress the games? it takes a lot of time to extract...
,junaid.kh,2011-09-28T09:17Z,"Fellows. im confused.
I HAVE BEEN USING ""ACTIVATE ISO"" SINCE BLACK OPS. N IT WORKS. ALSO UPDATED FOR KINECT, STILL WORKS.
BUT IM CONFUSED IF THE NEW XDG3 GAMES WILL WORK ON IT OR NOT. I DONT WANT TO RISK THIS. ANYONE HAVE ANY CLUE? PLUS : I DONT USE XBOX LIVE AT ALL."
,m66k,2011-10-17T00:38Z,"I had no trouble installing it etc, but the game isn't so good as Dance Central imo. The menus are bad and the pace is too damn fast and I cant see my figure on the screen. But it does get you sweating."
