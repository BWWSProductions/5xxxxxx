[T],Games4theworld,2010-12-05T14:17Z,"Hello,

@14.88.28

No, you need the base game from www.games4theworld.org too, since Late Night is only an Expansion."

I'm curious, I actually lost my Sims 3 disc and obviously do not feel like buying another, so I currently have installed the pre-cracked-installed version found here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5061019/The_Sims_3_(Mac__cracked)

will I be able to install your version? I'm sure you must somehow crack and/or update more...please help me someone with that?

I'm not an idiot, just not a sim-torrent master, at alllll.

,Kazzyy89,2010-12-09T11:28Z,"Hello, i Recently Downloaded your Fast Lane, Ambitions, and Late night torrents as i already bought Sims 3 And World Adventures. Upon reading the Instillation guild it states to remove all your games then reinstall them without the cracks. Do i actually have to go through all that hassle to add on one game? 
it seems pretty pointless to have downloaded the others if this one has to be done first.
i think it really should be stated on the summery because I've now wasted an evening of downloading. is there anyway around this? because i would love this expansion but can't afford to waste anymore time =("

[T],Games4theworld,2010-12-14T21:00Z,"Hello,

@Angel.xo

Yes, this version DOES work on a MAC. We're working a guide on how to Install our The Sims 3 packs on a MAC. It'll be released soon; please keep an eye on our Forum: www.games4theworld.bestgoo.com .

@Kazzyy89

There's no need to Install Ã¡ll Expansions. The Installation Guide says "" * = Optional"", so all the Expansions are optional, you only need the base game in order to run this Expansion correctly.

@womaan

It looks that the Cracks included with this Download are out-of-date. When the new, Updated Crack (With instructions) are ready, we'll publish them on www.games4theworld.bestgoo.com , so please keep an eye open there.

,JodieMcRice,2011-01-17T23:39Z," Thanks man! It runs perfectly!

HERES A LITTLE FEEDBACK:
VIEWERS READ AFTER DOWLOADING THIS TORRENT: In the instructions it says you have to uninstall everything and then istal again. YOU DONT! I had only the sims3 base installed and late nigh was my first expansion. THIS IS ALL YOU HAVE TO DO: Skip all 8 first steps. Just Install late night. use one of the codes given in the instrauctions and then just follow the FIRST instruction related to folder 1. If you already have another expansion or add ons- then do the same for folder 3 and , but dont copy/paste folder 2."
,JodieMcRice,2011-01-17T23:41Z,If somebody needs more help Im willing to give it :) Im just supporting the torrent community xD
,KaliSita,2011-01-18T04:34Z,"@JodieMcRice

Following your advice, I did not uninstall any of the expansions.

I did everything else as the instructions said to do.

Now when I load the game, it says ""please insert game disk"" and gives me an option to ""retry"" or ""quit""

How can I fix this so I can play?

Confused on whether uninstalling and reinstalling would have made a difference.

Thanks!"
,OregonGirl,2011-01-19T11:30Z,Will this expansion work if I try to use it with a legit copy of the base game?

Here's some better advise. We always recommend you keep an eye on our Forum and here's the reason why: we've created a fix which gives you the latest version of the game, without having to reinstall everything.

So everything should be fine! BUT, there's only one thing that's wrong:
the text of everything that has to do with late night and outdoor living stuff doesn't shows! I can play the game but I can't see what I'm doing. 
For example: I take my guitar and I click on it. Then there must be a textballoon (wich is) but there's no text in it!

Well, that error is being caused because of misplaced cracks.

[T],Games4theworld,2011-03-17T22:15Z,"Hello,

@anima273

No, this is only the Late Night expansions. You can download and install all expansions separately from www.games4theworld.org .


@pal666 & @thesims2customs

You need to be more specific on what your problem / error is, so I can guide you.


@ohitsmex 

  Please open the .rar file you downloaded using only WinRar, which can be downloaded from www.games4theworld.org . (If you use any other software than WinRar, like WinZip or 7-zip, the files will get messed up!)
When you've opened the file using WinRar, select Ã¡ll the files in it and drag & drop them to a folder on your Desktop. When the extraction is done, close the .rar file and open the folder on your Desktop. 
Now, start by reading the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"" and you should be able to get the game to work yourself. Good luck!

Yes, our versions of The Sims 3 games / expansions fully work with a legal version of any of the The Sims 3 games. (So also with a retail base game)

No, there's no more specific order. Just be sure that you dÃ³ install LN and OLS and thÃ©n apply this fix: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t752-the-sims-3-latest-fix-should-fix-most-of-your-problems
If you do not install those two, the other expansions won't work.
