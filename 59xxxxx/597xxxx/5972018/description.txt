This is a set of plugins for Ulead PhotoImpact (and yes Photoshop as well, even though I hate it).  There are also rare animation plugins for Ulead GIF Animator, and effects plugins for Ulead Cool 3D. Ulead GIF Animator, Cool 3D, plus Smart Saver Pro 2 are also included. 

The PhotoImpact plugins feature AutoFX and the entire line of KPT (Kai\'s Power Tools) Plugins, going back to KPT 1. Since KPT 1 and 2 require a 16 bit image editor, one is included.  

There are also many other plugins from Alien Skin, Extensis (these may not work with PhotoImpact), Flaming Pear, Red Giant Software, Andromeda, Xenofex, and Ulead (yes, Ulead made Photoshop plugins).  

These are mostly retro plugins which may or may not work in Vista and 7, and almost definitely will not work in recent versions of Photoshop, particularly CS5 (so, no whining... stop being an elitist that has to use the absolute latest software, regardless of quality).
