,ravendrow,2010-11-24T01:17Z,dude there is no mention of xbox scene or the team jungle twitter page not sure how much i trust this i will flash to a spare drive and let everyone know. but on the other hand sunblock is a trusted uploader mind if i ask is this the beta version c4e was supposed to release to the testers yesterday
,silent69,2010-11-24T01:27Z,Will LT+ boot all my older backups?Do i have to make new backups again?

Wrong both, You need tools/hardware to flash ur dvd.


The point with Skulls/Trusted is that u will know who upload fakes/crap etc....I dont realy think they give out skull/Trusted to ppl who upload fakes..?. :P"

,pickled_egg,2010-12-01T21:34Z,"@Linkmrr 
as long as you play offline you won't be flagged.
When you play Online you you choose to send information to Microsoft about the game you are playing & your gamer scrore .
Microsoft could program the 360 to send data about the disc's you loaded offline but what you do offline is protected under the Data Protection Act . This pisses Microsoft off no end but they will not violate this law (they tried with WindowsXP original, which sent data about your system to Microsoft. After a quick court case Microsoft altered the programming)
I currently have iXtreme 1.6 & play backups offline every day (including the lastest games). My wifes 360 is iExtreme 1.51 & she too plays backups offline.
We do play original games online so we do send details of out games played & gamerscore to microsoft but there is nothing in the data sent that can flag us.

So don't worry. You can play backups as long as you don't play the backups online & you will not be flagged."
,IBINARYI,2010-12-08T07:29Z,"I will make this easy for everyone.

Right now 3 games have the Anti Piracy 25 code on the disk for games Assassins Creed Brotherhood, Need 4 Speed Hot Pursuit and Fable 3. Yhese require a patch to the ISO file using the patcher application ppf-o-matic and the correct patch files for these games unless stated they have already been patched before downloading. LT+ is for the new dashboard that supports KINECT and for these games. older versions of ixtreme are fine for other waves. Important part is don't even load these new games without LT+ or without patching while connected to xbox live or you will be flagged for ban. It not about playing multiplayer to get bannded, it's just being connected to xbox live. Use caution and to be safe if you choose to hack is stay offline. This means no Wired or Wireless connection to be sure."
