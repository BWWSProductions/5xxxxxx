[V],polisdavid,2010-11-23T07:56Z,"THANK YOU SEEDERS!! ;-)

As for the game part, that was part of the torrent info, I didn't write it.

Also, this works on PPC machines with OS X.4.11"
,divemstr,2010-11-29T22:24Z,"I have been using TurboTax for years and while it looks like a game, it is a business tool.  The Deluxe version makes moderately complex taxes simple with a bonus of e-file built-in."
,divemstr,2010-11-30T00:35Z,My version of TT Deluxe needs registration in order to get the many updates that TT produces before April.

,ustad_sam,2011-03-05T05:28Z,please upload Canadian 2011 Corporate Turbotax?
,tedwu,2011-03-27T08:41Z,"@polisdavid
would you be so kindly to provide us with a 2010 Windows version. While others have provided 2010 versions around but I don't trust their file as their rep has not been earned yet."
,Monroville,2011-04-14T17:23Z,"This is a DMG file and as such I cannot open/use it.  Is it too much to ask to upload an ISO or proper EXE file?  Regardless, how does one open or convert a DMG file so it can be used?"
