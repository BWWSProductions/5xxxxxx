A fusion trio of real splendor:
Norwegian guitarist and classical composer Terje Rypdal, Czech bass player Miroslav Vitous (founding member of Weather Report) and US-American percussionist Jack DeJohnette (Miles Davis / 1969-1972) released this excellent album in 1979.
Instead of presenting ostensible, stereotyping banalities or, like most other supergroups in jazz/fusion, straining after effect, this trio infatuates with magic interplay and picturesque sound paintings.
Airy and floating melancholic soundscapes, that leave a deep impression of fine jazz/fusion art - not wearing out even after endless listenings.
