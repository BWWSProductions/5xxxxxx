James Brown - The Payback (1974) [Vinyl] [FLAC]


Review

by Mark Deming

Originally released in 1973 as a sprawling two-LP set, The Payback was one of James Brown*s most ambitious albums of the 1970*s, and also one of his best, with Brown and his band (which in 1974 still included Fred Wesley, Maceo Parker, St. Clair Pinckney, Jimmy Nolen and Jabo Starks) relentlessly exploring the outer possibilities of the James Brown groove. Stretching eight cuts out over the space of nearly 73 minutes, The Payback is long on extended rhythmic jamming, and by this time Brown and his band had become such a potent and nearly telepathic combination that the musicians were able pull out lengthy solos while still maintaining some of the most hypnotic funk to be found anywhere, and on the album*s best songs -- the jazzy *Time Is Running Out Fast*, the relentless *Shoot Your Shot*, the tight-wound *Mind Power*, and the bitter revenge fantasy of the title cut -- the tough, sinuous rhythms and the precise interplay between the players is nothing short of a wonder to behold. And even the album*s lower-key cuts (such as the lovelorn *Doing The Best That I Can* and *Forever Suffering*) sink their hooks into the listener and pull you in; quite simply, this is remarkable stuff...
