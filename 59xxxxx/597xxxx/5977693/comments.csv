,V0dKa99,2010-11-23T08:14Z,"is this real or fake? most releases are just a smidge shy of 350, not 318 MB...that and I don't recognize the release group either

someone please confirm if this is really the right episode or not and check for viruses."

There doesn't seem to be a Men With Brooms ep this week, probably because the final ep of Battle of the Blades was 60 minutes instead of the usual 30 minutes."
[V],maestral,2010-11-23T17:21Z,"Great rip err0001. I'd be happy if all previous rips were of this quality. AND smaller size. Whatever you did, it looks great.

Cheers. Keep uploading tv shows ;)"
