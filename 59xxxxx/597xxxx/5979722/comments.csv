My friend, on behalf of the people of tokage and reason, the nations of this here planet, Jesus Christ, Satan, and Deez Nutz, I must declare, that not only is your mix of blaze tunes a fine nod to Eminem of late, but also manages to be consistent in its ability to suck balls. Quite an accomplishment there, if I may add. Kudos."
