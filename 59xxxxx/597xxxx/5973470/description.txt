SUMO Kyushu Basho- Day 08 - Nov 2010 (Xvid-AVI)
Welcome Back Sumo Fans.  Here is day 08, of the Kyushu Basho

-Torrent downloaded from *emonoid.com.txt		advertising!

Choose the file(s) you wish to download, and please seed as long as you can.  The *.AVI file is the smallest (720x480) that I dare make it to be able to play on a large screen LCD, as the original broadcast is NOT in HD.  Sorry to those who have asked in the past for me to make it smaller (for faster DL).  

To those who have not downloaded from me before, there ALWAYS seems to be a speed issue in the beginning.  I am on the ass-end of the internet and my provider also caps the speed to different nodes throughout the world.  That is the way it isâ€¦ sorry!  I continue to seed throughout this Basho until the next one starts, and eventually (patience, younglings!) there are enough seeds (thank you to all who do!) to get the speeds up.  In other words: do not bother commenting on how slow the torrentâ€™s going, it is not going to get me to magically 'make it go'.
