,upstreamftw,2010-11-23T07:09Z,"99% of these movies with multiple .rar files are those gay ones that ask you for a certain ""codec"" and send you to some lame site. Pretty bs if u ask me and those who post them should be punched in the throat."

,bighun,2010-11-24T04:12Z,Why does everyone bitch about rar files? Just download winrar for FREE. It's better than winzip. If you're downloading stuff on TPB than you can download winrar or something similar. Thanks to deffjam555 for the upload.
,Jaudrop,2010-11-24T12:56Z,^agreed. People who complain about the .rar files are either just lazy or using their grandmother's computer that's still pushing win95 and 128mb of system memory \m/.>_
,skarlottt1,2010-11-25T17:03Z,"Rar extractor works great for MAC too.
The only thing I did while using a PC was virus scan it. When it didn't have a skull for sure.
Hope this one dls. The last time I tried it it got stuck at INFINITY!!!!!!!!!! "

,madpikey,2010-11-29T11:37Z,rar files are comressed to make it easier to down load all u freaks stop moaning and give a big thanks to all the p2p scence for bringing us thease files  
,Trangiamaneter,2010-11-30T03:03Z,Well compressed files is good for text files but wont compressed movie files more then 1-5% as they are already compressed.
,janscott,2011-01-02T23:25Z,Anyone with half a brain knows when it's downloaded - all you do is rightclick on the 1st .rar file and tell it to download to etc!  Make it goes into a folder though otherwise you'll have files all over the shop (like I did all over my desktop once!  Aaaaaargh! )  :S  Open up the file and voila - there's yer friggin' .avi file!  Jeeez!
