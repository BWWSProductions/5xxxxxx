,mitesh95,2010-11-24T05:21Z,"such a small movie
xD"
,allwin27,2010-11-27T00:13Z,"How to play the movie through media player?the extras appear in between the movie.can't watch the whole movie without extras.PLs help.
why the file not in MKv?"
,Atsaluum,2010-11-28T10:07Z,"Mountin this with Daemon Tools Lite and trying to rip it to HDD results in a ""Drive is not ready"" error. Saying that I have no reason not to believe this is 1:1 copy of the orig. BD."
[V],aoloffline,2010-11-28T12:04Z,"allwin27: ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre or mirilis splash player will play it perfectly(if u have a good PC) with menu and everything

Atsaluum if it doesn't work mounted,than extract all the files (it's gonna take a while )"
,Atsaluum,2010-11-28T15:16Z,"Everything I have is in mkv, and that's what I prefer over anything else. It's probably most versatile and supported packaging for PC and media players over all. If something is in ACHD, TS, M2TS etc. format I demux and remux them to mkv. I'm not talking about encoding here, vice versa retaing untouched quality.

You probably can copy all the 59 M2TS files from BDMV/Stream folder, but it seems that the movie is splitted by chapters on file level and there are menu animations, trailers etc. among those in non-orderly fashion. I was hoping that a succesful rip with AnyDVD HD would have resulted in a single M2TS or TS file on hard disk, wich you could have demuxed with TSMuxer and again remux the resulting files with MKVToolnix to mkv-file, with subs and everything neatly attached."
,SOLOinc,2010-11-28T15:53Z,"If you want to watch this on the Dune Base 3.0 player, it won't work as is. You have to extract the files. I used IsoBuster 2.8. Create a new folder and extract the contents of the BDMV and Certificate folders to it. The Dune player will then play it. "

,Atsaluum,2010-11-28T16:01Z,"*sry 4 the typos above

00100.mpls contains the correct playlist for the movie playback, which is:
01.m2ts
04.m2ts
09.m2ts
10.m2ts
11.m2ts
13.m2ts
15.m2ts
...
37.m2ts

I've just added and joined them in tsMuxer in correct order and demuxing them atm. That and remuxing will take a moment... If I had more than 200kBps upload, I might re-upload the resulting mkv."
,allwin27,2010-11-28T16:17Z,"Thanks for the response.
I have a external media player (mvix 800hd player), i don't play the movie on the computer.the problem is i  play the folder to play the movie.it plays the movie but also the makings of the movie in between the movie.Do i have any option to take it off."

,InstantStarFan7,2010-12-07T18:49Z,"I'm in the process of downloading, but first of all, THANK YOU so much for uploading this. Inception is one of my favorite movies and I never get tired of watching it!! Anyways, I have never downloaded a large file like this in ISO format, so to transfer it onto PS3 is it possible to change the format? Thanks."
,Atsaluum,2010-12-09T11:43Z,"I also forgot the most important thing, whis is:
Thank you for this great release!

PS: I suppose for majority the mounting and playing it with PowerDVD or similar suffice, but the instructions above are for those who prefer mkv."
,rttlesnke,2010-12-12T17:38Z,"Bastard uploaded the bluray itself...hahaha

anyway, gr8 job aoloffine!"
,hobg,2010-12-13T21:21Z,"hi guys! does the torrent (i mean the disc) contain the menus and all extras, or just the movie itself? thanx"
,bobman123,2010-12-18T21:57Z,"ive downloaded it and like otherws have said you CANNOT watch this movie as it is as all the chapters are in the wrong order and have director cuts in them etc.

Can someone PLEASE post here the list in which each chapter/file should be played? As ive never watched this movie before and would like to watch it as it should be - In the right order...."
,561Hero,2010-12-20T04:46Z,Holy shit..
,Atsaluum,2010-12-20T17:43Z,@bobman123: PLEASE (do note all caps) look at my post above. I did write down the correct playlist order for the movie. The reason there is other stuff in there is because that is the actual BR-disc - with menus and everything btw. The order for the director's commentary version of the movie can be read from one of the playlists on the disc. That is if you're unable to mount 'n play as is.
,fly2stars,2011-01-08T19:27Z,"If this is the full BluRay Disc, then why is one of the screenshots (inc02) so different in sharpness and color from the original bluray screenshot in here:

,Atsaluum,2011-01-10T13:03Z,"@fly2stars: Maybe because the other pic is 1,3MB and the other one 1,6MB. And there's approx. a 1-4 frame difference in the screen shots to begin with."
,T3hSeeder,2011-01-22T23:43Z,"I used this to play the stream parts just fine after mounting with daemon tools

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5562074/PowerDVD_10_Ultra_3D_v10.0.1705.51_Preactivated_%5BADHDerby%5D

I just dont know how to properly play the Blu Ray DVD with the menus and the entire movie seemlessly. It would be preferable to just play it from the mounted drive with some kind of a player. The players listed here: ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre, mirilis splash player ,MPC-HC dont work as well as the PowerDVD and not everyone has Dune 3.0  that does not work as well as it should be. Is there any player that just werks normally?!?!?"
,T3hSeeder,2011-01-22T23:43Z,Oh and thank you aoloffline for uploading!
,wildwill2002,2011-02-02T10:54Z,I mounted this bad boy with Virtual Clone Drive and played it using PowerDVD 10. Works like a charm. BTW this copy includes all of the menus and special features.
,namit1malik,2011-02-22T16:07Z,"open the ISO using poweriso and copy BDMV and CERTIFICATE folders to the root of the ISO and then delete the {Inception 2010 BluRay 1080p VC1 DTS-HD MA5.1-CHDBits} folder,after that save the ISO.mount the ISO with virtual clone drive and the run with either powerdvd 10 or arcsoft total media theatre.haven't tested any other players"
,Imaloser2,2011-03-05T07:50Z,"39 gb...  I agree with PauFitl2008.... You've got to be showing off. And I also agree with poppedtart, waste of hd space."

WORKS GREAT!!!"
,Adamskilou,2011-06-17T00:07Z,"I mounted the iso as a virtual drive, then copied the Inception folder containing the BDMV & CERTIFICATE from the virtual drive to my hard drive. I then loaded up ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre v5.0 and clicked on load movie from folder, I pointed it to the Inception folder & it loaded up, :-) all Menus!..Bells!!! & Whistles!!..etc... I was quite happily watching when it froze at around chapter 5...If I try to skip past it it keeps going back to a copyright notice...so it may be some form of copy protection..not sure?!? "
