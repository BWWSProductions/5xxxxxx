,bluecar5556,2011-01-02T13:25Z,"it says ""no input file specified,"" I discovered when there wasn't a tracker inputted when I created a torrent, the same error would occur."
,bluecar5556,2011-01-09T17:09Z,The keygen is more than likely for a previous version because NOVABackup says that a V12 key is required.  Do not bother downloading and ESET Nod32 says there is a virus in the program itself and NOT the keygen so downloader beware!
