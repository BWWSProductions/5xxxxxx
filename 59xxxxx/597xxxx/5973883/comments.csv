,beastlypanda,2010-11-22T01:34Z,@Neuro_Belmont If you take about 2-3 minutes to browse the internet you will find there are a few copies of DKCR floating around in forum based sites (wiiSOS/wiiso). Dont be such a cunt.
,Vasheal,2010-11-22T01:39Z,looks real but uploaded by anonymous?? seems a little suspicious to me
,jboykin325,2010-11-22T01:40Z,Thanks so much Wiisos! Works perfectly on my 4.2 using Configurable USB Loader. :D
,jboykin325,2010-11-22T01:41Z,@Neuro_Belmont WiiSOS.com is a legitimate site that hosts working wii isos. This works perfectly on my wii. 
,damienisxcore,2010-11-22T01:45Z,I'll take one for the team. Will report when finished.
,Neuro_Belmont,2010-11-22T01:48Z,"@beastly panda - pandas were my favorite animal until you called me that name. If you were familiar to this site you would know that anonymous usually means FAKE. I didn't say for sure this is fake.

""@Neuro_Belmont WiiSOS.com is a legitimate site that hosts working wii isos. This works perfectly on my wii. ""

but how do you know the uploader didn't just put ""wiisos.com"" in the description?"
,Vasheal,2010-11-22T01:48Z,oh so its real? nice! been waiting for this all day thanks man
,Neuro_Belmont,2010-11-22T01:58Z,"Fine, well I guess other people have assured us that it is real. 

I just wanted to make sure I wasn't wasting my time and anticipating playing DKCR only to find out after a day downloading and pop it in the Wii that it is really Imagine Party Babyz."
,tronik123,2010-11-22T02:49Z,"I was starting to wonder if this game would appear!.  

Epic Mickey is leaked nearly 2 weeks early and is all over the net, yet Donkey Kong Country Returns only comes out mid-afternoon in one place on the day of its release?  (no newsgroup post yet).  I was surprised a game like this wasn't leaked on Friday or Saturday since I know all the WAL-Mart's had them then.  What, there are no disloyal Wal-Mart employees leaking games anymore?"
,smknjoker,2010-11-22T03:08Z,"You haven't heard of Anonymous? lol.

 My guess this uploader has adopted the same basic principle of anonymity, as the group. 

Thanks Anon."
,Neuro_Belmont,2010-11-22T03:25Z,"""Dark_Knight1 at 2010-11-22 02:06 CET:
Thank You Anonymous! I have been waiting for this game ever since it was announce. Been refreshing the Wii section every 10min and Finally I got thru I'll make sure I seed until the end of the month. @ Neuro_Belmont wouldn't you upload a file Anonymous but I bet u wouldn't care if you get caught and sent to jail.""

Well, then why isn't everyone anonymous? I can understand what you posted, but too many torrents by anonymous are fakes. If it's real, cool then I apologize."

,apollothedog,2010-11-23T05:27Z,"confirmed, working.

Guys, just goto http://www.apiratesbook.com/guides.html

Head to the Wii section, and learn how to add the games to your HDD!

,jdfelmet55,2010-11-24T10:27Z,"great game...works great on softmod wii, usb loader.....good job "
,smknjoker,2010-11-25T02:15Z,"Dude I have a NTSC WII and play PAL games all the time. 

You just need to use a USB Loader to load the game off a external hardrive. 

Or you can burn it to a disc and load it through a USB Loader.

You just need to mess with the Game Load Settings before you start the game to get it to work."
,FedeVII,2010-11-25T18:17Z,It just work (Wiiflow).
,Poe6661,2010-11-27T23:21Z,"smknjoker I have a NTSC wii and run games off externals as well, but I couldn't get the PAL Resident Evil Archives to run with USB Loader, even after messing with the settings. The game would be black and white and the screen would roll downwards, like watching local channels with a bad antenna. Maybe I don't know how to tweak it well enough?"
,balina,2010-11-28T04:04Z,and the pass for the rar is ?

,kuhn5257,2010-12-03T20:05Z,"I have dled this game, my question is, I know how to make an ISO file but I cant get my drive to recognize the Wii game inserted. Let me know if I need another dvd drive because I tried the dump on the wii but it split into 3 files and didnt work"
[T],Distrance,2010-12-04T09:21Z,"Poe611 : You need another custom IOS to run the game with. When in USB loader you can choose the cIOS to run it with, but obviously you need it installed first. Google GAF Usb Loader guide and check the Hermes 222/223 guide.

Kuhn5257 : What do you mean Wii game in the drive ? Are you trying to backup your real game or do you mean that your Wii can't recognize the burned game ? Either way : Get USB Loader and do it the easy and cheap way, not the DVD way. And btw. Red/Black Wiis cant read burned DVD's and you can't change their dvd drive."
,MigsFR,2010-12-04T16:28Z,"I can't get is working, I'm using wiiflow, I can start the game but after the game pad instructions I get a black screen...

I played the whole game up to level 2-4, Cannon Cluster, and it just stays looped on the loading screen (where DK and Diddy run across the screen). 

It just loops this loading screen over and over, and i'm unable to do anything and am forced to hold the power button to shut down.
