My dearest Piratebay friends,



recently, a new Belgian movie called "Adem" (English title: Oxygen) came out and was a big succes. The music for this movie was made by a very cool collaboration between ex-Hooverphonic singer Geike Arnaert (Belgium) and Spinvis' Erik De Jong (Holland).

Since they were very enthusastic about the music they created, they decided to put it on a record and brand it as "DorlÃƒÂ©ac".

Today, I bring you a selection of half of the songs on their CD:

01 - Dying in Silence
03 - Backwards
05 - Lemon Pie
07 - Aerosol
09 - Disparu


I did not upload the entire album because I feel that sharing music is all about "getting to know" music and then supporting the artist by buying the music on CD.

Especially in this case, the composers' label is sure worth supporting because it is very much unlike the big bastard labels.

So if you like this, let's call it preview, then please support this band and the projects of Excelsior Recordings by buying the album at this location: http://www.excelsiorshop.nl/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=240


Enjoy the music!


Finest regards,


Wover
