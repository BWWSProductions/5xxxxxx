The year is 2007, the Danish rock scene is bursting forth with new and relevant bands, and here too, 
we find CHAINFIST a new and different kind of Danish Heavy Rock. 

Based in Slagelse, on the island of Zealand, and their roots firmly planted in the hard Rock soil, 
CHAINFIST has for the past 3 years played around the country in numerous shows, with bands like Magtens Korridorer, Carpark North, The Rumour Said Fire, and Danish trash metal kings, Artillery, as well as American legends Lizzy Borden, and Iron Maiden founder Steve Harris\\\' daughter Lauren Harris. 

CHAINFIST\\\'s music sends out tentacles in various directions, which is precisely what makes this band a unique live experience. 

CHAINFIST has been compared with many great Danish as well as international bands, giving a professional show, a frantic and charismatic stage performance, it would not be wrong to say, that the audience is carried away by vocalist Jackie Petersen\\\'s formidable voice, seduced by guitarist Michael Kopietz almost violin like solos, backed up by Jesper Heildelbach, Tim Madsen and Braca Pedersen\\\'s solid rhythm section. 

In 2009 CHAINFIST went into the studio to record their debut CD, a different interpretation of how to blend the harsh elements that you get from Metallica, Megadeth or Pantera, intervened with the more melodic rock from bands like Iron Maiden, Kiss and AC / DC. 
All this led to the creation of their debut album, \\\"Black Out Saturday\\\", which will be available in the Danish shops from mid October 2010. 

\\\"CHAINFIST is a Danish metal band from Slagelse / Copenhagen / Kolding and consists of Jackie Petersen (vocals), Michael Kopietz (guitar), Jesper Heidelbach (drums), Tim Madsen (guitar) and Braca Pedersen (bass). Some of these guys have previously been a member of bands like, Infernal Death, Epicenter, Panzerchrist and Frozen Sun.
