@DSIN: I have not Unrated version nor I can find one. I know that one exist (60 seconds longer, maybe one solid lesbian kiss more) but, as I said..."

,DSIN,2010-11-22T18:48Z,"@20-40 : 1 hot lesbian kiss... i can skip that LOL...
so will u do it?? if yes...please try to do it in min. 480p .. i want to watch the movie on my tv :D"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-22T20:28Z,"@DSIN: 1st. Yes, I'll do it. 2nd, believe me, TV is NOT the problem. Even 272p looks fantastic  for given size on ANY TV. What is critical, and I explained that - are two things (in fact three...): playback system and watching distance. These things are sanely explained both by me and many many others. Third thing is - between your ears and in average weigh 3 pounds or 1.36 kg."

[V],twentyforty,2010-11-22T22:06Z,"@mancbhoy: TPB numbers mean shit from 2007. I seed with 24000 kB/s. Maybe you are choked by abovetop dot net bastards or swarmed by protectors of innocence and righteousness. Block all gremlins, but unblock my seeding server, I alone can seed as anyone needs. Usually I'm only BitTornado with 100%."
