California-born Telecaster-master Chuck Prophet celebrates 25 years in the roots-rock business (the first eight with Green On Red) via this track-for-track tribute to hero Waylon Jenningsâ€™ outlaw-country LP of 1975, Dreaming My Dreams.

Chuckâ€™s been dreaming it ever since he released his 1990 album, Brother Aldo, right up until last yearâ€™s Let Freedom Ring! (recorded with his band, The Mission Express). 

When you revisit the original five-star, US Top 50 album, it becomes clear that 38-year-old Jennings had a sentimental streak for one so rebellious; lost here on 46-year-old Prophetâ€™s harder-edged update. While itâ€™s hard to recommend Chuckâ€™s strained â€˜I Recall A Gypsy Womanâ€™, his versions of â€˜High Timeâ€™ (very Duane Eddy), â€˜Are You Sure Hank [Williams] Done It This Wayâ€™ and Jimmie Rodgersâ€™ â€˜Waymoreâ€™s Bluesâ€™, are just the dogâ€™s bollocks.
