Described as Strung Out meets the Get Up Kids, Hidden in Plain View is emerging as â€œone of the best new bands out of New Jersey.â€ Five individuals , hailing from different backrounds, come together to form a unique chemistry and style . Their music combines poppy-punk vocals with melodic breakdowns mixed with a fair share of chorus chants that will echo in your head for weeks. Live, they deliver an energetic charisma that blends with the emotion of the music establishing themselves as a band that will surely leave a lasting impression.
