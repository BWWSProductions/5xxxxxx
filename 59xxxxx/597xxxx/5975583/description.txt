 The verdant green landscape, the magnetic blue  
 waters and the warm bright sunshine of beautiful
 Goa is home to one of the greatest magicians of 
 his time, Ethan Mascarenhas. Presently hosting a
 Radio Show that spreads magic and hope and      
 laughter through his irrepressible wit and humor
 to every listener and caller, it is difficult   
 to imagine that this is a man who has been      
 immobilized with a spinal injury for the last   
 fourteen years of his life.
