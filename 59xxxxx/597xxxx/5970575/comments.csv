P.S.: The bad thing is i have no global IP at the moment, so downloading could be a real pain. If i'll decide that release is failing, i'll probably delete it.
Peace."

,inval,2010-11-28T22:17Z,"I downloaded this torrent, it downloaded fine but I got a corrupted file, and I would rather not have to download the whole rar file again to get the one file I am missing.

I am missing BLES-00952\PS3_GAME\USRDIR\data\stage\sa25c.xfbin

If someone could upload just that file, I would be very grateful! :)"
