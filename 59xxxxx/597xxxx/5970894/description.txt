Storyline:
A roller-coaster ride of emotions through Manchester City\'s exciting 2009/10 season. Following five City fans in their battered bus \'Helios\' as they traverse the country hoping for glory, but not expecting it. This film is an exploration of what it means to be a true football fan. A story of passion and undying faith in a club, win, lose or draw. The movie is in turns hilarious, dramatic, moving and uplifting - an exhilarating examination of the power of football to move people
