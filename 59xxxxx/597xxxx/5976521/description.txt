This week on http://www.hiscifi.com - we get Steve Anderson of Open Media to tell us all about the recent fight to keep ISPs from starting a new billing scheme for Internet Users in Canada.

There is an ongoing online petition - http://openmedia.ca/meter

and the reasons why we must stop the ISPs from changing their way of charging users ranges from electronic rights to simple pocketbook issues.
