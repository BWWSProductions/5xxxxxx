,Qeunoxe,2010-12-20T02:21Z,"The download works perfectly..!

But i have a personal problem with this DLC..
The DLC starts off great!.. but then it all goes back to jimmy's vendetta ,.. boring, no cutscenes,almost no narrative context,.. Reading your missions,.......which means ..BORING.. such a waist.. Mafia II was a awesome game.. infact, probably one of the best games i have ever played!.. Mafia 1 is still my favorite game ever and Mafia II is a perfect sequal.. it it looks like the 2k czech did spend a lot of attention to this DLC.

Too bad.. :("
