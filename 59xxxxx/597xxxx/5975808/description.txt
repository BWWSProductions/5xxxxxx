"Jim Hardy is the most knowledgeable teacher in golf. This extraordinary book will be the most revolutionary instructional book since Ben Hogan's Five Lessons."
--Peter Jacobsen, Seven-time PGA Tour event winner

Voted one of "America's 50 Greatest Teachers" by Golf Digest and ranked in the "Top 100 Teachers" list of Golf magazine, Jim Hardy is a veritable scholar of swing. He's been fixing the swings of professional and amateur golfers since 1977, and in The Plane Truth for Golfers, he makes his groundbreaking concepts available to you for the first time.

Hardy's revolutionary approach is simple: There are two sets of fundamentals to the swing, not one. There is the one-plane swing, for more athletic players, and the two-plane swing, suitable for players of all abilities. Understanding these concepts is crucial to your improvement, and Hardy breaks them down into easy-to-follow steps, complete with dozens of photographs.
