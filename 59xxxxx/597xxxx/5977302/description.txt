Pompel & the Pilts. Rock band from Bergen/Norway (1988-1994). This is their legendary first release. Originally a cassette copied and sold in a limited number.
Recorded on an inexpensive 4-track portastudio, so it\'s not hi-fi. But the energy and the quality of the songs remains quite enjoyable.
Hope you like it!
