                    Before i Die.                            
                    Miranda is a clumsy woman but falling in a  
                    grave at the end of a funeral service was  
                    something not even she was expecting. The  
                    experience gets her thinking about what people  
                    will say at her funeral and she wants it to be  
                    good, so she signs up a for a charity parachute  
                    jump, reads to the elderly and helps her mother  
                    Penny and her boarding school nemesis Tilly  
                    organise a charity wine tasting event.   
                    Hilariously, her good deeds do not go as well  
                    as planned.
