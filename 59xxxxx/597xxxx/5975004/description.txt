"After hours of looking at photos online of soldiers, solely for the sake of a picture to be worked into the artwork of the release of "Frontlines" I was so moved and inspired by the commitment, not to mention the emotional and physical risk our soldiers take for strangers everyday, that I had to create this as a reminder. We are blessed that we are protected by such strong hearts." - Elias Soriano.
