This is for PC, right? By the way, is there any chance you could upload the Codex Book that Altair wrote? I couldn't have it here in Portugal...was too late, they sold out...Thanks"
,l_m_f,2010-11-25T20:41Z,"By the way, seed this, please...i'm stuck at 47,8%"
,DarkX610,2010-11-26T07:08Z,Thanks for uploading.Not everyone got the codex edition.So we are grateful to you.Keep it up....
,DarkX610,2010-11-26T07:25Z,ironic. not a single seed
,l_m_f,2010-11-27T12:16Z,"1 seed, at last! Keep downloading, then seed along!"
,renz62,2010-11-28T06:50Z,"yey! xD

,slapdatass,2010-12-06T11:10Z,Has anyone managed to get this yet? Seems to be no one with more than 49%
,l_m_f,2010-12-06T22:37Z,"slapdatass:

You can bet on it...I've been trying to download this for 3 weeks now..."
,slapdatass,2010-12-17T09:45Z,There's a seed...maybe...but it seems no one can connect to him *sigh*
,Hawkeye3,2010-12-19T11:01Z,"Initially, there was a seed that would connect on and off... sadly, that one seeder seems to have vanished completely now."
,xXx117,2010-12-20T00:16Z,please seed i'm at 48.9% for some reason i had no seeds and it was 150kb but now its stopped so i think we need more leechers and seeds!!!!!!!
,xXx117,2010-12-20T06:22Z,everyones stuck at 48.9%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! why!!!????
,xXx117,2010-12-20T07:40Z,why is the seed not working!!!!!
,JazzTrmpter,2010-12-29T08:22Z,"I am downloading now...
But as to why the seed stops at 48%..

If the file is opened on the uploader's computer or modified in any way, the file is corrupt within the torrent.  Therefore, it has to be re-uploaded."
,xXx117,2010-12-30T12:57Z,its really good now i'm beyone 48% some ppl are 100%!!
