    What really went on at the ancient Greek oracle at         
    Delphi, how did it get its awesome reputation and why     
    is it still influential today?                           
                                                              
    Michael Scott of Cambridge University uncovers the         
    secrets of the most famous oracle in the ancient world.   
    A vital force in ancient history for a thousand years    
    it is now one of Greece's most beautiful tourist sites,   
    but in its time it has been a gateway into the             
    supernatural, a cockpit of political conflict, and a      
    beacon for internationalism. And at its heart was the    
    famous inscription which still inspires visitors today    
    - 'Know Thyself'.
