Carole King [born February 9, 1942] is an American singer, songwriter, and pianist.
King and her former husband Gerry Goffin wrote more than two-dozen hits during the
1960s, many of which have become standards. As a singer, King's album Tapestry
topped the U.S. album chart for 15 weeks, in 1971, and remained on the charts for
more than six years.

She was most successful as a performer in the first half of the 1970s, although she
was a successful songwriter long before and long after that. She had her first #1 hit
as a songwriter in 1961, at age 18, with "Will You Love Me Tomorrow," which she
wrote with Gerry Goffin. In 1997, she co-wrote "The Reason" for Celine Dion.

In 2000, Joel Whitburn, a Billboard Magazine pop music researcher, named her the
most successful female songwriter of 1955-99, because she wrote or co-wrote 118
pop hits on the Billboard Hot 100.

King has made 25 solo albums, the most successful being Tapestry. Her most recent
non-compilation album is Live at the Troubadour, a collaboration with James Taylor,
which reached #4 on the charts, in its first week, and has sold over 400,000 copies.

She has won four Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of
Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for her songwriting. In 2009, Carole King
was inducted into the "Hit Parade" Hall of Fame. She holds the record for the longest
time for an album by a female to remain on the charts and the longest time for an
album by a female to hold the #1 position, both for Tapestry
