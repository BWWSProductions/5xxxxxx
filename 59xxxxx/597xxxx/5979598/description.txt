Plot outline:
Ancient Egypt, the 18th dynasty.
Akhesa, a ravishing 14-year-old princess, doesnâ€™t have the slightest notion that she will one day rule Egypt.
When this adventure begins, the impetuous young girl rebels against her father, Pharaoh Akhenaton. She refuses to live confined with the royal palaceâ€™s walls and wants to discover why her mother, Queen Nefertiti, has been exiled to Elephantine Island. With the help of Prince Tut, Akhesa runs away, hoping to find her mother. In defiance of danger, the two teenagers travel down the Nile, cheat death among the burning desert dunes, and bravely confront the fearsome mercenary Zannanza and the priests who conspire to overthrow the pharaoh.
With innocence their only weapon, Akhesa and Tutankhamun overcome all kinds of tests and ordeals, and encounter an extraordinary destiny that will unite them forever.
