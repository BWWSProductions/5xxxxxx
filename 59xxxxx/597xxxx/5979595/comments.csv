If your just trolling then shut the fuck up otherwise;
What the fuck is your problem man? Van Buren, Green, Bernard, they're all great characters and Robinette was in the series from the first episode. AFRICAN AMERICANS are a fact of life that bigotted scum like you can do nothing about so I suggest you get used to it."

Don't know why gcjm released it as if it is his own rip and never mentioned anything.
If you already have the complete set, downloading gcjm season 5 is completely waste of your time and resources.
Season 4 & 5 as well. Season 1, 2, 6, and 7 are different ones.
Be warned!"
