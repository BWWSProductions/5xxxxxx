Bill Flanagan (MT V/VH1) raves, "I bought House's CD after a show in New York City and, this never happens, I took it home and must have listened to it 20 times that weekend. I was knocked out." 2010 has already proven a breakout year for House, who is currently featured in an 11-page spread in the April issue of Esquire magazine. For the piece, Esquire invited five of their favorite musicians-Dierks Bentley, Charlie Mars, Bob Schneider, Ben Kweller and Griffin House-to take part in a songwriting challenge and two-day fashion shoot with world-famous photographer Danny Clinch in Clarksdale, Mississippi. More information regarding the profile is available at esquire. com/miss.
