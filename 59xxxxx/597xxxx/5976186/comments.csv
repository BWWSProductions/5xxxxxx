,Aciaeiig,2010-11-27T14:51Z,"@rickyjw: yes it does, I tried it before I uploaded it and it works perfect..."
,rickyjw,2010-11-28T01:21Z,"Really..?  When I try to run the reg.key file, I just get an error message sayin ""Cannot import, not a registry file""...."
,Aciaeiig,2010-11-28T01:40Z,"Well then you did something wrong:s


Install the app.

Use included keyfile to register app!

Copy the lic file to folder.

C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents\Winstep\Licenses


If there is no such folder search  for  winstep  and  you  will  find

corresponding folder  (same  syntax)  put  the  lic  file  in  folder
Licenses.                                                

Please block the prog from contacting home using a firewall."
,ddavron94,2010-11-28T02:31Z,"Tried as well, does not work. I copied and pasted the reg. file to the license file and it is not recognized by the program."

,nemgue,2011-03-02T18:33Z,"The first time worked, but when restart the computer win7 detected a error and stopped the program. That does not work for me"
,hustle_flow,2011-03-15T23:33Z,"Thanks a lot for this Aciaeiig, been looking for this for a while. I always loved the free version of the Nexus dock and always wanted to try out the ultimate version. 

To all those having trouble blocking this with the firewall, hope this will help:

After you install it and put the ""xtreme.key"" in the Licenses folder in Winstep (I also put the ""file_id.diz"" in there cause i didnt know what did lol)

The location for me on windows 7 64 bit was 
C:\Users\Public\Documents\Winstep\Licenses

then open up your firewall, just type in firewall in the start menu, and open up ""Windows Firewall with Advanced Secuirty""

Your going to have to define new rules for all the .exe files associated with Winstep, not just the WinstepXtreme.exe file. I did this for only the one file, and it recognized it was a crack and locked me out. No biggie, just reinstall and do it again, but anyways i digress.

So go in the Outbound Rules on the left pane, and click ""New Rule ..."" way on the right pane. Then follow all the steps. There is a tutorial for how to do this on the web, i googled it and the first link that came up was a Microsoft one, which was the one i used. 
 Remember to this for all the .exe files, not just the WinstepXtreme one. I did this for the NexStart, Workshelf, and Key Manager (although im not really sure what that was) .exe files. I also did this same procedure for ""Inbound Rules"", as well, not really sure if that had an effect but the program has been working well for me for about a week now. 

Anywho, just thought I'd share some of my insight, hope it helped. 

Peace dawgs"
,Krnzmaster,2011-03-28T22:26Z,"Hey, could you leave the weather exe unblocked? or will that also cause trouble. and if i can unblock it which .exe is it? haha, im guessing its services but im not 100% sure. thanks"
,Kilroy672,2011-04-12T04:15Z,Thanks Aciaeiig. Will the crack allow for updates? I did it one and updated fine but when I went to the prefrences I was stcuk at the register page and could not get past that to get to the themes and such. Should I leave as is and not update?
,tweeney66,2011-04-16T06:34Z,"Thanks for this, but as usual I have a million questions:
1)Do I have to block all the winstep programs from accessing the net ?
2)Is this RAM hungry?, sure looks that way. 
3)I guess you have to disable the weather widget ?
Thanks, again. Kinda hard to find this.  "
,harvengure,2011-04-21T19:42Z,"Scanned with Antivir and Avast, comes up clean.
Confirmed working on Windows 7 x64.

The instructions are simple.  
Install the program but do not launch.
 Move the keyfile to the location listed in the readme file.  
Block program from connecting to the internet.

Read Hustle_flow gives more detailed directions for thos who are interested.

@tweeney66
1. You do not have to but it is advised.
2. Ram hungry? Not really, no.
3. I got my weather widget working just fine."
,underclock4,2011-07-20T12:58Z,"
Just installed which went flawless..will be monitoring in terms of expiry. Will report in a few days.
Ensure you disable automatic updates.
Thanks to the uploader."
,underclock4,2011-07-21T17:09Z,"Worked one day for me and stopped, but I guess the reason is that I went on line and downloaded a theme from the official site. There was a frequent registration notice which kept popping up and couldn't start any programs.. Eventually had to delete via safe mode."
,yashaka71107,2011-09-29T23:05Z,"its work for me ever since without any problems, you just know the way how to block and delete some .exe file in winstep xtreme like i did and its never expired :) can't show u here, they may find out and block mine too :))"
