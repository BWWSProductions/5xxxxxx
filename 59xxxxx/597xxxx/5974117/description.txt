Top Cowâ€™s biggest event gets even bigger!

While Witchblade bearer Sara Pezzini and Darkness host Jackie Estacado form an uneasy alliance to search for their missing daughter, more of the all-powerful Artifacts are brought into play as Magdalena, Tom Judge and the Angelus join forces. But unbeknownst to any of them, the unseen villain is manipulating people and events to bring about the end of the world.
From Top Cow Universe architect Ron Marz (Witchblade, Angelus) and Top Cow superstar artist Michael Broussard (The Darkness) comes an event series, which will literally shake the Top Cow Universe to its foundation. Featuring a gorgeous cover by superstar artist Kalman Andrasofszky (Dazzler, R.E.B.E.L.S.) as well as a variant cover series featuring Tom Judge by John Tyler Christopher (Witchblade).

Each issue will also feature a Top Cow Origin backup written by Marz and drawn by a superstar collection of artists.
