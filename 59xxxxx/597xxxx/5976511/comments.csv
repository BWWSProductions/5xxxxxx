,ervin15,2010-12-07T21:22Z,"If you didn't follow the crack sequence and you did run the game, the original yuplay is resident in memory and won't let you run the game. 
First terminate it from memory through taskmanager (if you can;t through task manager simply reboot the PC) then follow the crack sequence allready described

Thanks"
