Apache: Air Assault is a new combat flight simulation game based on the
Apache AH-64D Longbow attack helicopter. The player takes on the role of
three distinct Apache crews that each deal with what at first appears to be
localized enemy activity, but eventually reveals itself to be part of the
larger plan. The gameplay intercuts back and forth between the three crews as
the action and stakes escalate.Apache: Air Assault features 16 multi-stage
missions involving air and ground strike operations off the coast of Africa,
the mountains of the Middle East and the jungles of Central America, each
meticulously created using high resolution map data from real-world satellite
photography. Apache helicopters are some of the most sophisticated combat
aircraft on the planet  the player gets to fly multiple variations of them,
each with their own extreme firepower and highly-detailed damage modeling
