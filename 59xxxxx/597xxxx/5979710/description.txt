Silver Revolt: "Crash JP Morgan" Goes Viral! 

Max and Stacy look at videos from the "Crash JP Morgan, Buy Silver" viral campaign. They also discuss whether "My father is Li Gang" is any less corrupt than "My Uncle is Sam", as mortgage holders go postal and regulators tell us to "batten down the hatches". 

In the second half of the show, Max talks to financial journalist Teri Buhl about Ambac's lawsuit against JP Morgan. The case JP Morgan is trying to seal was filed by New York law firm Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler for Ambac Assurance. To learn more about how JP Morgan is trying to cover up the alleged fraudulent practices of EMC (a wholly owned sub-company) and the Bear Stearns residential mortgage bonds it now responsible for: Look for Nick Verbitsky of Blue Chip Films upcoming documentary film 'Confidence Game'.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
