White Knight Chronicles 2: Awakening of Light and Darkness PS3 Game

Because this game is a direct sequel to the first White Knight Chronicles it INCLUDES BOTH THE ORIGINAL AND SEQUEL on one disc. If you do not have a completed Japanese save-game file from the first game, it will automatically start you in the first. You cannot play the sequel until you have completed the first and have a character to import into the sequel. However, the first White Knight Chronicles included on this disc has received a number of gameplay upgrades and enhancements to improve it over the original launch. Many of the gripes people had about the original game have been fixed in this version.

This game is entirely in Japanese, both audio and text. I found it to be very playable with limited Japanese ability and an online walk-through.

Tested and working with:
Hermes v4 3.50 spoof
Open Manager 2.1
Internal hard drive

Instructions:
Copy game folder "BCJS-30042" to internal hard drive via FTP.
Turn ON "Patch mode" within Open Manager or Gaia Manager.
Insert a legitimate Blu-ray disc.
Press X and launch from XMB.
Install the version updates normally when prompted.
