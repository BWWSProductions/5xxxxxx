,umbral,2011-01-14T23:31Z,"This version is broken. I recommend using the september 2009 version and update using windows update.

""At the start of the install Win XP tells me that it cant find the hard drive so cant install.""

This version doesn't have some basic storage drivers and you can't install it. "
,gussers3,2011-02-13T15:49Z,"The Dec 2009 has always worked for me but sick of updating now. And XP was never designed with SATA drives in mind so you'll all get a message about no hard drive if you're using SATA.
Thanks."

,PwNAGEToR,2011-08-01T17:26Z,"Great for gaming. Great for everything really. If you need SATA support, just intergrate the Mass Storage DriverPack (from DriverPacks.net) or use nLite. Simple :) Great UL!"
,no1243,2011-08-31T20:52Z,"I have been using this version of XP for a long time and it is awesomly fast. I have just gotten hold of a 64bit machine, can anyone give a full log of changes made, e.g through nlite, so the same setup can be made for 64 bit.

Any help is much appreciated, and obviously I will post the finished result on here for others to try if they wish.

tl:dr how to make xp Peformance Edition 64bit?"
