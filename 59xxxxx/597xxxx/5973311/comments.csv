[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-21T23:51Z,too many pirate ninjas?
,XxxCutterxxX,2010-11-22T06:27Z,Fucking ninjas i hate those bastards... mainly those damn smoke bombs!
,oslonerd,2010-11-23T00:22Z,Thanks :-)
,bluefeet,2010-11-25T03:39Z,"@XxxCutterxxX - Typically this is caused by your torrent app making a lot of different connections (all the various peers) and a router's CPU can only handle so much before it will start fall on its face.  Make your torrent client use less connections, or get a better router (I have a Gaming router, designed for lots of connections)."

,GodspeedX,2010-11-27T02:56Z,orrrr you could just get VLC and play everthing no matter what format it is..  haven't run into a video yet that I couldn't play.

Go fuck yourself you stupid shitface. If you can't handle MKVs then don't download. Your loss. We don't need shitfucks like you here. 

And Macs rule? Pssht... yeah buddy dream on, dream on.."

hahahaha, i really don't know WTF a mac has to do with the fact that you are really stupid.
any PC can handle any kind of format, get the proper software, lear to use a computer"

No issues playing on Win7 64bit.  Use K-lite codec pack, and media player classic.  Never had issues with any of aoloffline's videos.  If you dont know how to use a computer, then stick to iTunes."
,TxFox,2010-12-28T17:42Z,Video is jumpy and pixely in VLC... totally unwatchable.
,sam123456789,2011-01-03T09:27Z,Thanks AOL
,powerchord,2011-01-11T01:51Z,"@ Skeebop

The video is all distorted and laggy because your CPU is struggling to keep up! 

Try overclocking your CPU"

[V],aoloffline,2011-01-12T10:56Z," Try other player than vlc.Vlc is for xvid & dvd, is not optimized for high bitrate mkv encodes.there are no problems with the video,only with your pc/player"
,LOIL99,2011-02-05T04:03Z,I am now downloading...yes.
,brnslee,2011-02-23T04:16Z,"Looks awesome when played on 40 inch HDTV! I'd give Video a 9.5/10 just because a few scenes had a minor amount of pixelation at such a high resolution. Audio gets a 10/10.. This torrent is subtitled in English however, so if that is going to be a turn off for you don't download this torrent."
,rectan01,2011-04-17T23:20Z,"i found this strangely entertaining. very good movie. must say some of the singing and christian dialogs were abit too much for my liking but the movie got away with it.
