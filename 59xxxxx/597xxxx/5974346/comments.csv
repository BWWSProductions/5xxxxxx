,sick_cunt,2010-11-22T05:38Z,"@RB13
Was thinking the same thing"
,Redjuh,2010-11-22T05:39Z,"cause the person whow is responsible 4 da ul, has hd tv + rec. converting 2 'normal' size + uploading that 1, takes more time"
,Sharpsy1,2010-11-22T05:43Z,Thanks once again TvTeam!
,sick_cunt,2010-11-22T05:44Z,m
,Tapndatass,2010-11-22T05:45Z,Because when someone uploads the actual hd one it has a lot more seeds.
,baraquiel62-Mexico,2010-11-22T05:51Z,good speed Ill stick on this one instead of the 1.4GB. seems to be less size and faster after all.
,foodshelf,2010-11-22T05:59Z,"fake, requires password

here's the link inside the rar
http://yourbestzone.com/dexter/

junk, avoid"
,baraquiel62-Mexico,2010-11-22T06:09Z,is this fake????
,Thanks555,2010-11-22T06:23Z,"I know people are anxiously waiting to watch this show, but I don't know why so many people on bit torrents are so quick to complain, even though it's free.  
Thanks very much TvTeam!  I'm glad I don't have to pay the cable company any more than I do just to watch this show!  "

I can't imagine this being a fake.  I get my episodes of Dexter from TvTeam all the time.  "
,abaddyus,2010-11-22T06:44Z,"just one question, where is the .rar file that requires password? this is a .avi file, so isnÂ´t fake, cheers!!"
,grom86,2010-11-22T06:51Z,"I think foodshelf is spamming, there is no RAR, just the AVI, nfo and txt files.  DON'T CLICK HIS LINK.  So in other words, this is genuine, foodshelf is fake."
,xswcdevfr,2010-11-22T06:53Z,"Not fake, no rar. Just shut up if you don't know what you're talking about."
,munky261,2010-11-22T06:57Z,Fucking double RAR'ed password protected shite.
,munky261,2010-11-22T06:58Z,"Nevermind the above comment...wrong torrent, too many tabs open. lol"
,flarngus,2010-11-22T07:18Z,"@RB13

I was thinking the same thing.  Doesn't make any fucking sense to upload a LARGER file first proceeded by a SMALLER file.  Some of us can't play 720p on our computers, therefore, we have to wait a longer time for them to upload the smaller god damn file."
,Jackh2012,2010-11-22T08:04Z,Thanks guys!
,StayWay,2010-11-22T18:23Z,"Internet big heroes. Just fuck you all.

You are getting the show free and still complain, fucking assholes. Why don't you record and upload?"
,DannOrly,2010-11-23T03:40Z,"Thanks, mate :3"
