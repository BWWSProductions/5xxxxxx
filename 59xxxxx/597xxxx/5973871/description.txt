THIS IS THE TORRENT THAT POPPED MY CHERRY (AS IN MY FIRST UPLOAD)!! I HOPE I DID IT RIGHT. I WAS AMAZED TO FIND ONLY 1 ACTIVE JANE'S ADDICTION TORRENT ON TPB, SO I HAD TO ADD THIS ALBUM. I KNOW YOU'LL LOVE IT! THIS MUSIC BRINGS BACK SO MANY MEMORIES FOR ME. MOST OF THEM TOOK PLACE IN THE BACK OF A MINIVAN I HAD IN HIGH SCHOOL AND INVOLVE  A HUGE WATER BONG AND SOME AWESOME GIRLS I KNEW. IF ANYONE HAS MORE JANE'S ADDICTION, PLEASE UPLOAD IT. LEAVE ADVISE AND A COMMENT OR TWO AS I NEED TO KNOW HOW WELL THIS TORRENT WORKS OUT. ALL I ASK IS THAT YOU DO THE RIGHT THING AND HELP SEED THIS!!
