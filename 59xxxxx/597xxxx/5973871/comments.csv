,scottsasse,2011-04-06T00:36Z,"@nastesly1, I'm sorry if 1 of the tracks don't work for you, however in my description I DID say this was my 1st upload and also that I hoped I did it right. ..............And WTF are you complaining about, it's FREE!! Besides over 60 people have downloaded it apparently with NO problems. Not to mention I am the ONLY one who even bothered to upload this album on this website because I wanted to SHARE!! What, do you think I get anything out of this?? SO before you call someone's torrent ""shit"" why don't you try uploading a perfect and successful torrent? Or better yet, take your bitchy ass to the store and PAY $16 for the CD you fuckin' ingrate!!! Love, DrScott"
,goof1671,2011-07-24T10:11Z,"Good response scottsasse.  Natesly1 you are rude, unthankful and can fuck right off."
,scottsasse,2011-08-02T02:50Z,"@ goof1671, THANK YOU!! Decent and grateful people like you are the reason I upload torrents!! Because I like sharing music with the world and I am PROUD to see 21 seedere and only 2 leechers on this torrent. Many THANKS to all past, present and future seeders!! Love And Peace, DrScott  "

Just write it off as a very rude way of saying there is a problem with the torrent or one of the files in the torrent.

95% of the population are drooling morons."
,scottsasse,2011-11-11T07:18Z,"@PhilLesh12, You are so right!! Maybe I should have had a Xanax that day:)  THANKS for the support!!"
