,some-young-guy,2010-11-23T22:36Z,"This movie is like The Blair Witch Project, except this one doesn't have the element that BWP had of someone finding the tape that captured everyone dying.  Because of this fact, this movie will leave the viewer with the feeling of being cheated out of 87 minutes of his or her life that you can't get back.

One scene (the bonfire) is kinda cool, but that happens in the last 10 minutes of this movie so please skip forward 77 minutes and only be cheated out of 10 minutes of your life that you can't get back.

I do appreciate the uploader's dedication, but this movie just plain sucks."
