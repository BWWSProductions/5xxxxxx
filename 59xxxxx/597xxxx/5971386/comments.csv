[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-21T00:48Z,Mandarin eh?
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-21T00:50Z,"mmm, screenshots only prove to me the bluray wasn't very good to begin with."
,rakz2cul,2010-11-21T19:53Z,"quality is superb...this is way better than REFiNED version, stop downloading that one guys... this is awesome...thanks CHD"
,pizzahut123,2010-11-21T20:29Z,SEEEEEEEEEEEEEED YOU CUNTS
,IncredibleX,2010-11-22T13:01Z,"rakz2cul maybe youre right, but i saw the pictures and i dont give a fuck. I saw it, its perfect, you will see no difference if you will not play it simultaneously. So, i saw refined version and for 99.5% of people its good enough."
,aafz02,2010-11-22T13:16Z,"What's that green writing in the top left corner all about?  

Input size and Current frame etc?

Is that displayed all the way through?"
,rakz2cul,2010-11-22T13:32Z,"@IncredibleX my suggestion was meant  for only .05% of people...who will not mind downloading few extra gbs for the love of quality...don't make it a unnecessary personal issue,its definitely not my concern to who u fuck..got it"

,zomgrades,2010-11-24T01:25Z,"I just have a silly question, how come blu-ray torrents come before the release of the actual blu-ray?

It doesn't bother me actually, I would just like to know :D

Thanks,"
[V],BOZX,2010-11-24T09:40Z,"its just the way it is....
ppl like things which r not out yet.....
after release its not a surprise , the file to b  available here..."
,chazzee23,2010-12-03T19:44Z,i must remeber to say thanks when i finish dowloading this!!
,Hugo_Stiglitz,2010-12-11T12:53Z,"took over a week to download...but thanx a bunch BOZX...AV - 10/10

but i agree with HolyRoses...apparently quality in the blu ray disc wasn't amazingly-good 2 begin with"
