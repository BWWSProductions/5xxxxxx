,cheeseisedible,2011-03-01T07:36Z,"hey, thethingy, for some reason i cannot install Instant HD (neither standard nor advanced) on my computer. When I try to install, it gets to the page where you enter a serial number, but when I tried the serials included, they would not work. I have Win 7 Ultimate 64 bit. Any help you can afford to give me would be greatly appreciated."
