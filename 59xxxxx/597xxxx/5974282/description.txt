Brian finally hits literary pay dirt with a self-help book he dashes off and, not surprisingly, the fame goes to his head. Then his agent Stewie gets him on Real Time With Bill Maher, and Maher turns out to be no fan. Arianna Huffington and Dana Gould have cameos as Brians fellow panelists, and Ashley Tisdale provides the voice of a woman who wants Brian to autograph his book.
