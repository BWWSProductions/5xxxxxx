PLOT:


Christmas is coming and Santa's house is buzzing with activity, but somehow the old boy's heart isn't in it this year. Disillusioned with all the selfishness and greed in the world, Santa is ready to throw in the towel but his daughter Kristin (Kathy Ireland) persuades him to give the mortals one last chance. If she can prove that even one family can change and become giving and caring again, Santa will put off his vacation in Hawaii and get back on the sleigh. Trouble is she's saddled with the Morgans, a family with a workaholic Dad (John Dye) and a couple of kids whose idea of good clean fun is putting peanut butter in the au pair's underwear and permaglue on the school coach's whistle. And with a sister who makes Cruella De Vil look like the cutest pup in the shop ready to wreck her plans, can Kristin teach them that what you give is what you get, and stop the spirit of Christmas from disappearing - forever?
