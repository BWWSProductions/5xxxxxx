[V],twentyforty,2010-11-23T13:29Z,"@DSIN: Well, not just fourteen years below standards we have today, but Buster Keaton movies have better sound.

Joking aside, video is on the level with 1996. and sound is hollow, but better than CAM, definitely."

[V],twentyforty,2010-11-23T19:42Z,"@tylr: I really appreciate your efforts. I have the movie and subs too - but - sweet lord - do you really want to watch that?
Those who gave 7.7 on iMDB probably are Kim Yong Il and his nephews.

Sorry, I would spare my bandwidth by not doing it.

I found working copy and I can send you direct download links - just find my e-mail address in long Headers and send me one reminder there."
