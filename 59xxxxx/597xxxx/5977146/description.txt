Judging from the number of downloads o shows that I've packaged into H.264 MP4's, there appears to be a large demand for these shows in a modern video container. AVI's have become obsolete. 

However, to support these and future downloads I ask YOU KEEP SEEDING after your download is complete. This will free up my bandwidth for new torrent uploads. THANKS!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I took the VIDEO TS file of the DVD and ripped a H.264 MP4 file. The file has a suffix of .m4v as it was ripped using HandBrake 0.9.4 so it can be played on any current iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or in iTunes. It can also be played on any compliant player but you may need to change the suffix from .m4v to .mp4.

A note about the audio:

The videos indicate a separate AC3 channel with Dolby Digital 5.1 when you "Get Info" using iTunes. For a better explanation of this go to:

The second and third paragraphs apply to these rips. But as I understand it, all the suffixes must remain .m4v.

All I really know is I get 5.1 surround sound when I play on my 1st Gen Apple TV

Sting - Brand New Day Tour (Universal Amphitheater 2000) 

Synopsis
This stop on Sting's Brand New Day Tour tour finds the singer/songwriter/actor not only playing songs made popular from his solo career and days with his previous band The Police, but he also performs the album of the same name in its entirety. Sting's vast musical range is displayed here, as he performs reggae with "Message In A Bottle", gets a little jazzy on "Moon Over Bourbon Street" and contemplative on "Every Breath You Take". This 18-song concert video provides a prime opportunity to get a good overview of Sting's dazzling musical career, as well as a taste of what the man is like in performance. ~ Dan Macintosh, Rovi
