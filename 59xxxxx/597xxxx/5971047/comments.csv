,shadowbo,2010-11-21T02:55Z,"Anyone had luck with this so far?
I downloaded this version of the game
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5785281/Starcraft_2_Wings_Of_Liberty_FIXED_ISO___Campaign_and_Skirmish_c
Which it seems does not work with this patch (MD5 mismatch) 
So yeah, wanna make sure you guys had success before I download the game again.
Also, what does the keygen do?
Does it make a starcraft2 CDkey so you can play on battlenet or what?
Thanks,
a confused noob"
,.schmu,2010-11-21T17:07Z,"Just use the sc2 repair function --->update---->crack should work fine...no maleware btw...thx AitB 
"
,shadowbo,2010-11-22T02:57Z,"It worked perfectly, thanks.
Another question... what type of liscence did the keygen generate?
Is it supposed to get me a CDkey or just enable the patching, etc?"
,iycgtptyarvg,2010-11-22T09:21Z,"After installing and starting the game I go to a login screen. If I click on 'Create account' then I'm taken to the BattleNet web-site. If I click on 'Play as guest' it tells me I need to create an account first.

Do I need to create an account to play?
If so, how?
If not, what do I need to do than?"
,Bifidus,2010-11-24T07:28Z,"Same problem here : not working.
(build 1.1.3.16939)"
,Bifidus,2010-11-24T07:47Z,"ok, it is working, but you have to relocalize the game to enGB (google it)."
,Vaan1993,2010-11-25T01:38Z,Need Help downloaded the game and took me to battle net How do i play the game with out making an account?
,brunohll,2010-11-26T00:35Z,"Thanks AiTB, as always: QUALITY!
Works a treat for playing skirmish games using SC2ALLin1 v10.3.3."
,Cheska214,2010-11-27T12:02Z,"Um just wanna know the keygen???
The gen keys and will just prompt License generated! now keys what so ever...

all the datas is working fine but for the keygen I doubt it....... 
already created an account still not working......

I did all the steps but it the end it will end up to get a key.. ya cannot access the account......
Sigh I thought there is a better gen key activator but my bad :("
,Cheska214,2010-11-27T12:10Z,Not working :(
,Mile9086,2010-11-27T23:12Z,i dont know how to do this please uploader or somebody write full depth process of how to install this patch. preety pleasy 
,Cheska214,2010-11-28T04:39Z,"Guys.... This is only a manual update on the latest patch ya have to have engb sc2 to do so.....
can some pls upload a good gen key to make this work :)"
,Cheska214,2010-11-28T08:11Z,"After 6 tries I finally got it :)
yup its working.... (only single player and skirmish) my bad get a lot of info on other cracks....... this is one of the most twisted cracks I've encounter so far but its worth it..... updated sc2 I love ya guys......... ^^ sowe for the previous comments........ "
,rabid_chicken,2010-11-28T09:41Z,I also cannot get this working. I load the game and click guest but it says I need to connect to battlenet to verify my copy.
,Cheska214,2010-11-28T10:20Z,"you must disconnect the internet......... 
open keygen to access the single game then open ya sc2..... ^^
to access the skirmish ya have to download SC2ALLin1 v10.3.3. 

Hope it will help ya ^^ "
,rabid_chicken,2010-11-28T11:33Z,"Disabled the internet then ran keygen. It says license generated. When I load the game it still says 

""Offline play authorization required"" To enable offline play, connect to battle.net to authorize your game client. You also need at least one starcraft II character on the account.

Any ideas? "
,Cheska214,2010-11-28T11:59Z,"Go to guest there ya can play the campaign.. 
But for skirmish ya have to download the SC2ALLin1 v10.3.3.  
Ya can find it to pirate bay as well....
this is not a sc2 crack that ya can access all...."
,stubbieaussi,2010-11-28T21:57Z,"I still cant get this to work.
Tried all suggestions mentioned here but when I start the game it still goes straight to the need battlenet logon account menu to play.
Trying to play as a guest still requires Battlenet authorisation.
I have the same version of the game as shadowbo has."
,Cheska214,2010-11-29T03:01Z,"One reminder it will go to battle net if ya are online...
This crack is only effective if the internet is disconnected while playing the game....

follow the steps that i've posted and ya can play this updated crack.... ^^

P.S. this is not like the reload crack tha ya can access all ok ^^

hope that it will help ya ^^ "
,rabid_chicken,2010-11-29T04:53Z,I am not online when I load the game. It detects there is no internet and says that I can only play in offline mode if I have first authorized my game by connecting to battle.net. 
,rabid_chicken,2010-11-29T07:50Z,Ok I did a fresh install with the internet disabled. I installed the patch included. I ran the sc2_copy.exe. I then ran the keggen.exe and clicked ok. It says license generated. Closed that and loaded the game. Same crap. Says I need to connect to the battle.net web site to activate my copy to play in offline mode. 
,Cheska214,2010-11-29T08:42Z,"just go to the play as guest ok... ill just put the steps by sets for those who is still confused in putting the patch... I'll make it as easy as possible remember I told ya this is one of the most twisted crack I've encountered... ^^

1. copy sc2 enGB

2. one's installation is finish close the sc2 (don't make it update)

3. after that no need for internet connection disable internet and update the patch using this crack ok. (sc2 will open automatically so close it again)

4. Run sc2_copy.exe (this is the crack for the battle.net so don't ever forget it)

5.one's its installed  Use the keygen to generate a license (ok this is the most tricky part....)

  FYI: If you will open the sc2 w/out generating the key it will say create account right... 

5. one's key gen is activated open ya sc2 and it will prompt that ya need to provide an (e-mail add to connect to battle net) skip it a just click play as guest.....

there  ya can play the campaign sc2 

plain and simple ^^
-----------------------------------


For skirmish to play the game this is the steps   

1. copy SC2ALLin1 v10.3.3. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5775431/Starcraft_2__Single_player_Skirmish_AI_cracked 

2. install SC2allin1 setup.....

3. you will see in your desktop sc2allin1 icon click it 

3.one's it's open look for add map and add the big game hunters on the downloaded file (better know where ya put the file cause there you will get the map) ^^

FYI: just google for more maps ok.......

4. navigate it a set your custom setting for the battle.

5. press lunch button and there ya are playing sc2 vs ai 


Pain and simple ^^

""Important reminder""

Don't play the game online and if sc2 is open the sc2allin1 will not work.
Close sc2 and open sc2allin1 first......

-------------------------------------

I've make this work with this steps and I've make this as simple as possible....... ^^

Have Fun... ^^ wanna help others 
(sharing if a gift ^^)





"
,rabid_chicken,2010-11-29T13:15Z,Uninstalled and tried again. Still didn't seem to work. Read a post in which someone said they had to try several times before it would work. I ran it and it wanted to connect to battle.net again. Quit and reran the crack and key gen. 3rd time it worked. Don't know why but for some it sometimes doesn't work first time so just keep at it.
,Cheska214,2010-11-29T14:23Z,"Yup rabid.......
That's the part that's really confusing (the keygen ^^)
but if ya will look closely there is a diff.

Try to check that without the keygen activated the sc2 will show you that you have to create an account.... ^^

But if the keygen was activated properly sc2 will not prompt to create an account ^^ then skip the connect to battle.net go to guest to access single player ^^ 

that's the trick on that keygen ^^

but I prefer the reload because it can access all sc2 (multi, single and replay on skirmish) the only prob is sc2 on that crack is not updated....
(BUMMER :(..)"
,contralegem,2010-12-01T20:47Z,"UnfAkinbelievable! It actually works quite well. Cheska u r the man, I wouldnt figure this out without your help there!"

,LBxTheHouse,2010-12-15T07:41Z,Can someone help me? I downloaded the torrent but when I open the folder it says there isnt an appropriate program to open it. Also there are no zipped or compressed files for me to unrar. What do I do?
,Cheska214,2010-12-15T10:34Z,Use pea zip... ya can unzip it using that application........ ^^
,Patone,2010-12-19T18:59Z,"You can also try 7-zip archiver. It's fast, reliable, free, and can unpack many archives that WinRAR won't recognize."
,himan95,2010-12-25T02:34Z,"This worked for me :
Instructions:
1) Mount, Install the game and skip activation (disable your internet or be ready to cancel the updater after the installation finishes).

2) Use the SC2-1.1.3-enGB-patch.exe to update to 1.1.3.

3) Extract SC2-1.1.3_Razor1911_ONLY_CRCK.rar

4) Run Keygen.exe (Run as admin or it won't work) and press ok to generate a license.

5) Run sc2_copy.exe (Run as admin just incase).

6) Run SC2Switcher.exe in the Support folder of the StarCraft II directory to start the game.

7) Play as Guest and choose between 3 profiles."
,jeffabe3,2010-12-27T10:56Z,"Wow this worked perfectly for me!
No need for other programs like the SC2allinone.
Fully working Campaign and Skirmish modes on the game itself.

To everyone having problems this is how i did it:
1. Install a fresh copy of StarCraft II Wings of Liberty (Fresh install to remove all the previous cracks)
2. After installing stop the game from updating
3. Run SC2-1.1.3-enGB-patch from the download
4. Run Keygen as Administrator (THIS IS IMPORTANT TO GET THE GUEST ACCOUNT WORKING!)
   (To run as admin on XP simply shift+double click)
   Click OK then QUIT.
5. Run sc2_copy
6. To play the game, use the SC2Switcher.exe located at the install folder starcraftII>support to prevent the game from updating."
,kazjwan,2010-12-27T18:28Z,"@jeffabe3
i used this update and followed your guide but when i try to play as a guest it says that i need to connect to battle.net or something like that"
,Cheska214,2010-12-27T21:34Z,"It means that ya did put ya key gen properly...
try to look on the install guide that I've created before........
and read some of the comments after that.... ^^"
,jeffabe3,2010-12-28T01:47Z,"@kazjwan
you need to use the keygen correctly, run as admin then click ok and quit it.."
,kazjwan,2010-12-28T16:11Z,"@cheska and jeffabe
i tried this method for over 5times and it still DIDNT WORK

1 install starcraft (no crack applied)
2 install thepatch 1.1.3
3 install sc2_copy
4 open keygen as admin and pressed ok (License generated!) and quit it
5 open SC2Switcher.exe which starts the game
6 press at guest

and here is my problem; it says that i need to connect to battle.net or something like that

i didnt have internet on for the whole time"
,Cheska214,2010-12-29T04:44Z,"really here's the thing ok. I ya put the keygen correctly..... the sc2 will not ask ya to create an account....... It will just pop on the screen that ya need to log in ya account...... that's the diff if ya put the keygen correctly.... then play as guest.....

Ok I have another way to connect ya to ya campaign........
have ya tried to play the sc2 using the sc2allinone?? (there ya can play sc2 vs ai)

If so  just gen ya keygen so that sc2allinone can be access and click ya sc2allinone......
one's ya are in the game exit it so that ya can return to the main menu......

one's on the main menu go to guest and there ya can do campaign......
this is the long method to make sure that ya put the key gen properly.....


buy Ya can easly notice if the keygen is working ok.... look carefully....... If the KEYGEN IS NOT ACTIVATED YA NEED TO CREATE AND ACCOUNT TO GO TO BATTLE.net...... but if ya put the keygen correctly sc2 will just ask for ya e-mail to connect to battle.net........ (if ya see that just skip the connection and go to guest).........

try to experiment so that ya will see the difference ok.......... for more question just post and if I can answer ya question I'll do so ok ^^"
,jeffabe3,2010-12-29T05:31Z,"@kazjwan
try disabling your anti-virus for a while. run keygen as admin then quit. what OS are you on?"
,kazjwan,2010-12-29T14:46Z,"@cheska
i tried with sc2allin1 but it doesnt work
@jeff
i tried that too and it doesnt work
windows xp service pack 3


the most hardest crack ever made"
,kazjwan,2010-12-29T14:50Z,is a battle.net account required?
,tammttg,2010-12-31T17:54Z,"it works fine, but I had to run Keygen many times
so happy now ^^
thanks for sharing "
,jukez7,2011-01-07T14:09Z,"This was propably the hardest update/crack ever, however it works.

Im not sure actually what made it work, but this is how it went down for me:

I had the SC2 reloaded version installed, and first i ran the repair.exe in \starcraft 2\support. 
2. I installed the 1.1.3 update.
3. tried to ran the keygen (which crashed everytime I pressed ""OK"")
4. ran the sc2_copy.exe
5. Tried to run the keygen again, with no succes.

then I decided to update my windows xp from SP2 to SP3 and after that the keygen worked. Im not sure if its the update or the fact that I hadn't rebooted my computer for a while.

After the keygen had generated a licence, I ran the sc2switcher.exe from \starcraft 2\support\ and it worked like a charm :) When it asks you for your battle.net profile, just click ""play as guest"" on the right bottom of your screen. You should be able to choose between three razor profiles.

This version allows you to play campaign, skirmirsh vs AI and challenges so there is no need for sc2allin1 or any other additional software. Plus the fact that it doesnt load the mapeditor everytime you want to play skirmish makes it a lot faster to load and you can even view your stats and build order afterwards."
,Cheska214,2011-01-08T19:15Z,Ya.... thats the prob if ya will only use the switcher ya can only play the skirmish with ai via single player but with sc2allinone ya can have multi players via lan connection.... That's why I still advice other's to use sc2allinone........ ^^
,goldashphoenix,2011-01-17T05:37Z,"sc2allin1 with lan? there's no such thing...  according to the sc2allin1 site:

What is ALLin1 tool??

It is an automated legit launcher tool that makes it possible for you to play the SC2 Retail offline, without cd-keys etc, load skirmish battles, and watch replays.
It doesn't mess with the original SC2 game and will allow you to play WAN through battle.net (if you have bought the game), and also download updates normally!
The launcher has a user friendly interface with no need to copy and paste files around. Simply install the SC2 Retail and then the launcher and you are ready to play!"
,Cheska214,2011-01-18T06:58Z,"Have ya tried it using lan..
Ive already use it and it works and its up to ya if ya will use it the way I've used it ok.
so just try it before replyin cause ya read on the web forums on the sc2allinone before tryn it.^^
(so try it before braggin ya know all in the post lol)...... what a dush............ :p"
,wiltuz,2011-01-18T09:17Z,"Quick update!
if any of u guys have Nvidea Geforce 310M and the game stutters and lags like shit, it probably is because of the latest driver(260.99 i guess) Just rollback ur driver and it will work perfect.
==Peace=="
,goldashphoenix,2011-01-22T06:02Z,"OOOKKKK you are able to play multiplayer lan on starcraft 2 by this tool, funny  I tried months ago and it'll just launch the game to play like skirmish does (playing with AIs)..... and even if it did blizzard should have already stop the development of this software like the ones who attempt to emulate battle.net. 

Well anyway sc2allin1 is good tool if you want play sc2 skirmish right away or tired to look at the raynor's face on loading screen at intro.."

Just use the update patch included in the torrent and then run the keygen.  Also, when you start the game make sure you login as a guest in order to access campaign and skirmish modes"
,turdfurg,2011-03-24T06:35Z,"Also, do not start the game by running ""StarCraft II.exe.""  Instead, you'll have to go into the ""Support"" folder and run ""SC2Switcher.exe"" to start the game"

,Outland41,2011-04-08T20:31Z,"^ ^ ^ 
Yep, I got that BSOD. 

The only way I could fix it was to just let the game auto-update to the latest patch (1.3.1.) however, it immediately renders this crack useless. 

Sorry to say, but the 'formal' instructions to get this working are particularly sloppy -- I wish I had read it earlier, but turfdug seems to have the better idea-- which I'll try now.

Just to round-up: it just seems wholly bizarre to tell people to use the auto-update function at all. Blizzard will change everything that made a previous crack work for older versions as soon as they cotton-on -- it's clearly a crucial purpose of their bullshit update system... and the very nature of the beast.

,MixHa,2011-07-29T19:16Z,"OK guys I had a lot of trouble of setting up this Starcrap, finally it works so I will tell how I set it up.
1. Installed SC2 and aborted update.
2. I downloaded patch SC2-1.1.3-enGB-patch.exe and applied it.
3. In this Razor crack you have file sc2_copy.dat (it's not .exe as everybody is speaking, at least I see it as .dat file). In it, there is Battle.net directory. Copy that over same directory in your Starcraft II game directory (example D:\games\Starcraft II\) and also in the My Documents (example C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Blizzard Entertainment\ ). So you need to overwrite two Battle.net directiries.
4. Run Keygen.exe from Razor crack, press OK.
5. Run  SC2Switcher.exe file found in StarCraft II\Support\
6. Now you should have enabled Play as guest option.
7. If it doesn't work, try again and again like I did just don't further update game and hopefully you will get it running. Keygen seems to be a bit f*cked up... Good luck."
