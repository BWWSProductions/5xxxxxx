,mhc121,2010-12-19T19:23Z,"sinjanju, ur the retarded one. this movie was hilarious. &  i'm not the only one that thinks that. it received many positive reviews. it's way better than alot of the crap that came out recently, like cop out. & what's with the CAPS & double posting. ur like a 4 year old that needs attention."
,imakewebs,2011-01-01T15:29Z,"sinjanju, this movie was HILARIOUS!  I normally do not like ""goofy"" movies, but this was sheer genius.  Well Ferrell is back.  He hasn't done a movie this funny in a long time.  Mark Wahlberg had me rolling.  Who knew he could do comedy.  The movie has a slight edge of 1970's police type drama and the intro with the Rock and Sam Jackson was hysterical.  I found myself watching that scene 3 times laughing and puzzled at the same time.  Then the conversation about the Lion versus the Tuna was CLASSIC.  I watched that 3 times because the first two times I laughed so hard, I could not breathe or really HEAR what was being said."
,CrespoAndre,2011-01-26T17:00Z,Hi can anyone help me?? I've downloaded the movie but when i try to watch it on Windows Media Player i can only hear the sound and the screen gets all green... does anyone know anything that can help me???
