The film begins at Ron Kovicâ€˜s childhood during a summer in Massapequa, New York. He attends a Fourth of July parade, plays and wins at a local neighborhood baseball game, and watches President John F. Kennedyâ€˜s "Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country" speech, which later inspires him to enlist in the Marines. The filmed scenes of his past imply that his childhood is innocent and carefree; however, that changes once he becomes a teenager. Now a star athlete, with the same patriotic views, he makes a decision that will forever change his life.

After Ron Kovic and his classmates hear an impassioned lecture about the Corps, Ron decides to enlist. He misses his prom because he is unable to secure a date with his love interest, Donna. He confronts her at the prom and has a dance with her on his last night before leaving.
