She learned to play the acoustic guitar at six at the encouragement of her father, started electric when she was eleven and left school (Mercedes College) due to the lack of support of her peers, enrolling at Cabra Dominican College. At the age of 15, she turned her focus on writing songs and so began her professional career. She has been playing in bands since the age of 14 in England and in France, her first stage show for Steve Vai at age 15. Orianthi met and jammed with Carlos Santana when she was 18. He invited Orianthi to get up and jam with him at soundcheck then later asked if she would join him on stage that night to jam at his Adelaide concert, Memorial Drive on 30 March 2003. She signed with Geffen Records in late 2006 and struck a management deal with 19 Entertainment.
