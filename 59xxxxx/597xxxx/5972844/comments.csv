,vodafne,2011-01-17T06:23Z,Good game works great on psp 1001 with 6.35hen must download this game everyone. 
,NitrogenUA,2011-02-09T16:36Z,"SammGriff, after downloading the game ""just put game-iso to ISO directory on your Memory Stick."" - like it's said in torrent-description.

If you have no ISO folder - tell me what firmware and psp model do you have?"
,NitrogenUA,2011-02-09T17:12Z,"As far as i can say, there is only one file in this torrent and it is FMH2011.iso
Am i wrong?"
,NitrogenUA,2011-02-09T17:15Z,"And speaking of firmware, most likely you'll need to update yours up to 5.00 M33 or 5.50 GEN, cuz this game is pretty new. Are you using CUSTOM firmware, or an official one?"
