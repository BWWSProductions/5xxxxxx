BBC Panorama: Secrets of Scientology
====================================
First broadcast September 28, 2010

John Sweeney revisits the Church of Scientology
-----------------------------------------------
In 2007, while investigating the Church of Scientology for Panorama, reporter John Sweeney had a dramatic on-camera confrontation with a church spokesman named Tommy Davis. The church was accusing the reporter of bias and it attempted to stop the documentary from being broadcast - a campaign backed by Scientology A-lister John Travolta. Sweeney has returned to investigate the church again.

John Sweeneyâ€™s follow-up to â€œScientology and Meâ€ features the involvement of Marty Rathbun, Mike Rinder, Larry Anderson, Jason Beghe, Amy Scobee and Marc & Claire Headley. Sweeney gets a full hour to put together one of the best broadcasts on the subject in years.

The audience for the broadcast was huge. Nearly 5 million people watched the show as it aired live on the BBC.  Millions more will see it online. The New Statesmen called it â€œa bad day for Scientology.â€ Anons are buzzing about it over at Why We Protest.


PLEASE READ - A WARNING!
There is a "documentary" circulating called "Making A Killing - The Untold Story Of Psychotropic Drugging"
This "documentary" is propaganda by THE CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY!
The "Citizens Commission on Human Rights" is a FRONT ORGANIZATION OF SCIENTOLOGY.
A quote from CCHR.ORG: "CCHR was co-founded in 1969 by the Church of Scientology"
Why is the Church of Scientologu so down on psychiatrists? Because they believe they can cure any mental problems by joining their cult!
Please, research it yourself!
