,MesmerEyes,2010-11-29T23:52Z,"This is NOT A FUILL MOON TORRENT!!!  It is a Twilight torrent.  The FIRST, Initial film of the series!!  I wasted three DVD's on this, and the time to download it three times from this site!!!!

Thanks to you for being a liar!!  If you could have posted the correct film that you say is here, it would have been a wonderful thing.  But all we can do is HOPE you won't lie about it!  As there's no way of CONFIRMING AN ISO FILE WITHOUT BURNING IT!!!!  

Viper121, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I PERSONALLY WILL NEVER DL ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU POST, BECAUSE IT MIGHT TURN OUT TO BE FRELLING CRAP!!!"

,viper121,2010-12-02T03:25Z,"I must say MesmerEyes that I have no clue what you are talking about when you say ""NOT A FUILL MOON TORRENT!!!"", but i am sorry that you are a complete idiot
Just to clear things up this is Twilight saga: New Moon"
,kirakira819,2010-12-05T04:09Z,"Sorry Viper, but this isn't New Moon. This is Twilight, the first movie. It is a decent version of it though."
