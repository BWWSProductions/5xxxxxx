,Jabdy69,2010-11-22T00:06Z,Is it the Clean or the Dirty Version ??
,tehkaholic,2010-11-22T05:51Z,"Hello bubanee!! downloading your torrents for a week now,Can't get out of stopping my client off. What I love the most are your own rips with perfect scans. All songs are outrageous with exact pass off in V0. It seems you'll rule this scene very soon. Bring us more exact audio files (We'd love HQ scans too :P) where others/sceners fu**ing fail bringing re encoded and joined promo tracks."

,Jabdy69,2010-11-22T12:41Z,I like the [MP3+Cov] more than the CDrips
,Danman42,2010-11-22T13:00Z,"Hey bubanee thanks for these albums Nicki and Black eyed peas. I don't know if this helps just to let u know what albums are scheduled to be released this month. Just what I researched this month. :P . This isn't a request just helping.

It's OK mate, really looking forward on seeing your rips (Danman42's list looks promising ;D).
I doubt these [MP3+Cov] are from original CDDA source. Many are ripped using dBpoweramp or either EAC with lame 3.98.x
Please clarify me whether these are real as said in the titles. It's just to make sure those are from exact CD.
Thanks again for all the UP's :)"
