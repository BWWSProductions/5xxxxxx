Poe Boy/Atlantic recording artist Flo Rida's highly anticipated third studio album, 'Only 1 Flo (Pt. 1),' arrives in stores and online November 30th. The album is highlighted by the brand new single 'Turn Around (5, 4, 3, 2, 1).' Fresh off the success of his current smash single 'Club Can't Handle Me (feat. David Guetta), which became the rapper's fourth Top 10 U.S. single, Flo Rida's newest offering will be released in two parts, showcasing his multiple sides. 'Only 1 Flo (Pt. 1)' - a collection of anthems that display his melodic style' will be followed by 'Only 1 Rida (Pt. 2)' an edgier compilation that showcases the rapper's verbal dexterity and various rhyme patterns - expected in the spring of 2011.
