,gregmlr,2010-11-29T03:57Z,"All of the copy protection apparently hasn't been removed.  Finder shows ISO as only 6.41GB but when mounted the VIDEO_TS folder is 58.87GB.  When I try burning with Toast it crashes and I get an error code when I try transferring to my Boot Camp partition to attempt burning it with DVD Clone.

A for effort, F for execution--Look elsewhere."
