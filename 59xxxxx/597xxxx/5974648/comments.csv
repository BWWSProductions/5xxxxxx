,ili2882,2011-10-20T16:03Z,@Ausdemon  and anyone else having audio problems this has 5+1 audio if You're watching it on a stereo system you need to downmix the audio to stereo there should be an option in vlc to select the number of output channels. I use ffdshow and in the audio config check mixer and select stereo.
