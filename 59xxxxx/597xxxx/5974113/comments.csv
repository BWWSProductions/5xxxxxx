,MonoEgg,2010-11-22T19:09Z,"I'm D/ling now, I expect its 6.58GB because its 720p HD video file, most likely a .mkv file. That's about right for a video of this length."
,twodragons,2010-11-22T20:11Z,"What is wrong with all you downloaders????
The object of torrent sharing is to SHARE!!!!
Nobody is doing this and it gets annoying after a while ........ you self absorbed types know what I'm talking about!!!! SHARE, SEED!!!"
,twodragons,2010-11-22T20:24Z,1.6 kb down ...... geez thanks for sharing all this ...... (sarcasm) !!
,Koskankorva,2010-11-22T21:05Z,"seed ffs, if U seed more people will probably seed aswell so everyone can watch this damn event.. wtf is so hard to understand ?!"
,MonoEgg,2010-11-23T02:27Z,"I get speeds of 100kb/s+ d/l; but u/l is always slower... its going good right now...
used to be able to use bestmmatorrents, but I couldn't sustain a decent ratio... I try to seed!"

,Murk1,2010-12-22T04:04Z,none of my vid progs understand this file. And TSMuxer (I use alot) cannot convert it. Anyone else have a problem with this? Maybe I have a corrupt DL?
,Murk1,2010-12-22T04:05Z,"and yes, I know it is an mkv file and I have all the proper codecs. I watch MKV all the time..."
