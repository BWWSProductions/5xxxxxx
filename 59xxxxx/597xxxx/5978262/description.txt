Blue Velvet (1986)

Director: David Lynch

Blue Velvetâ€™s opening scene represents to the viewer a picturesque, idyllic paradise set within the quiet logging town of Lumberton: white picket fences as far as the eye can see, vivid green grassesâ€¦ It follows the story of Jeffery Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), who, after discovering a severed ear in a field, embarks upon a search for its owner, accompanied by Detectiveâ€™s daughter Sandy (Laura Dern). This exploration drags Jeffery into a sordid, sinister underworld, a descent marked by the introduction of Isabella Rosselliniâ€™s beguiling nightclub singer Dorothy Vallens.

Beaumont and Vallens embark upon an initially voyeuristic, and at times almost disturbing, relationship, which does not bode well with Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), the resident sociopathic gang leader. Intrigued by the hold Booth appears to have over Dorothy, Jeffery cannot help but investigate further, finding himself sucked further into this criminal underworld.

The relationship between the two also begins to impede the development of Jefferyâ€™s budding romance with Sandy. Dern delivers an understated performance, so much so that at points she runs the risk of fading into insignificance.

The film is worth seeing for Dennis Hopperâ€™s performance alone, which is in equal parts hilarious and disconcerting. Strangely reminiscent of both Twin Peaks and 1950s noir, the film teeters between surreal and enthralling, at times verging on the disturbing, all factors that have endeared it to viewers and ensured its cult status. 

In addition to Blue Velvet's various "all time greatest films" rankings, the American Film Institute has awarded the film three honors in its lists: one on 100 Years... 100 Thrills in 2001, selecting cinema's most thrilling moments and ranked the film's villain Frank Booth, as one of the 50 greatest villains in 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains in 2003. In June 2008, the AFI revealed its "Ten top Ten"â€”the best ten films in ten "classic" American film genresâ€”after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. Blue Velvet was acknowledged as the eighth best film in the mystery genre. Premiere magazine listed Frank Booth, played by Dennis Hopper, as #54 on its list of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time, calling him "the most monstrously funny creations in cinema history". The film was ranked #84 on Bravo Television's four-hour program 100 Scariest Movie Moments (2004). It is frequently sampled musically and an array of bands and solo artists have taken their names and inspiration from the film.

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
