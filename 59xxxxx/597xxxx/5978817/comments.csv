,lynx_ca,2010-11-24T08:31Z,"watched in vlc player,  i skimmed through the movie just to check quality. 

seems good, audio was in sync, at some times it does look like a cam but i believe it is the way the movie is filmed that makes it look that way.

though i disagree that its a dvdscr, the quality is quite good. "
