,.caleb.,2011-01-07T09:08Z,I turned off firewalls and stuff but do you know why it can't find an email address after it tries to check email addresses?
,ThiagoEC,2011-02-09T21:19Z,"Same problem as .caleb.

It keeps searching email address and then reports:

""unable to get an email adresses.
make sure that you are connected to the internet and try again later.""

Someone have an idea to solve this?

Anyway, thanks for sharing it."
