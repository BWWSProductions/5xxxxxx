Pop sensations, JLS have gone from newcomers to the biggest boyband of a generation in just two short years. Outta This World, is JLS's aptly titled second album. Working with a roll call of international pop-R&B production talent--whose collective CVs include the likes of Rihanna, Ne-Yo, and the Black Eyed Peas--Aston, Marvin, OritsÃ© and JB have crafted 14 killer tracks ranging from heart-pumping techno-laced stompers to tender acoustic balladry. Co-writing the majority of the tracks, the guys display the full range of their talents from the smooth close harmonies of "Other Side Of The World" (with the lads sharing love-struck lead vocals) to kinetic future pop like the take-no-prisoners floor filler "Superhero".
Working with Stargate (the force behind monster hits for BeyoncÃ©, Flo Rida and more) has produced some of the albumâ€™s stand-out tracks; the frankly brilliant title track "Outta This World"--a muscular electro-fuelled heavy hitter, anthemic Children In Need charity single "Love You More" and band favourite "Love At War". The number one single from the summer "The Club Is Alive" is also included
