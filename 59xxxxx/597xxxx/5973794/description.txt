Fashion's best-kept secrets from London's leading fashion authority 

Why is it that simply getting dressed in the morning can be a bewildering experience? Last month's must-haves date you faster than a frizzy perm, and before the credit-card bill is paid, some expert is telling you your latest fashion fantasy is now "so last season." The more you buy, the less it seems you have to wear. 

Knowing what works and what doesn't, how and when to shop, how best to dress your body shape, and how to work an accessory like a styling pro will propel you on your way to fashion nirvana: the effortlessly chic set. With timeless tips and practical advice, fashion editor Paula Reed proves that you don't have to have a big budget, a whole new wardrobe, or the latest fad to look great. 

Transform your life with these expert lessons 


When to spend: what is worth a budget blowout and what can be a cheap buy. 

How to find the fabulous in every figure: dress thin, tall, and timeless . . . promise! 

Secrets of the successful shopper: how to know if it's eek! or chic!

Each chapter focuses on a particular element of fashionâ€”coats, dresses, suits, bags, jewelryâ€”making it easy to navigate the world of fashion. From eveningwear to work wear, weekends to big nights out, from the boardroom to the home office, Reed covers it all with warmth, wit, and intelligence.
