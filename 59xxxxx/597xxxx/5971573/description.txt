The problems with housing today are common knowledge almost the world over. Small apartments, high prices, increasingly heterogeneous families, etc. These problems, which occur especially in urban environments, affect an increasingly high percentage of the population. The aim of Practical Ideas for Small Spaces is to provide readers with practical and manageable ideas to adapt their small homes to the different needs and paces of their lives. A host of images illustrate ideas and practical advice; from the use of color to the design of the furniture or lighting. All provide invaluable help when making the most of all corners of the house, giving diverse uses to a single room or better organizing storage space. ..........................
