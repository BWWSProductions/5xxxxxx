,The_Ephebus,2011-05-02T11:08Z,"That's how it's supposed to be. Lossless releases should NEVER be split, or you'll be losing the exact gap and index information from the original CD contained in the rip's accompanying .CUE file. There is no point in including a .CUE file if the audio has already been split. You can easily split the album into songs after downloading, but I want to have the complete unadultered rip, thank you. 

As to APE, it's the most common lossless format for Windows users (FLAC is more common in Linux), and it reaches a higher compression ratio than FLAC, at the expense of longer compression/decompression times. Both formats do their job well, if the releaser used a correctly configured EAC to extract the audio."
