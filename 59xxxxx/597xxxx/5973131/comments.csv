The vid and audio quality is the best i've seen so far for this little gem tho so thanks for that.

,tkimitkiy,2011-04-06T18:13Z,Most of the movie is out of sync... Anyone can post the synced audio track? :-/ :(
,vidiation,2011-12-08T16:12Z,"Many thanks for the UL, but the audio is horribly out of sync.  I make adjustments in one section with either VLC or MPC, but then it's out of sync in another part of the video. I'm playing with Avidemux 2.5 to try to fix, but not sure if it's the best solution. Too bad, this classic deserves better!"
,Terrannack,2012-04-12T16:27Z,"Guys, the audio track is VBR (Variable Bitrate), which explains the out-of-sync. It's easily solved by using an encoder (such as Virtualdub or Handbrake). You can leave the movietrack untouched. Just make sure you convert the audio track to a fixed bitrate. Afterwards it should be in sync."
,strangerbarry,2012-04-29T19:35Z,No question - the audio is a mess.  Terranack it would be really awesome if you could sync the audio and repost.  It may be easy for you - anything is easy if you know what you're doing - but you need to be realistic about what the general community knows how to do.  Byrnrocks:  I'm totally in agreement with Clerfay - what's the point of uploading a good movie if you're not up to doing it properly - this upload is a huge disappointment
