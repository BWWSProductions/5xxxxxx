This will do nicely."

[T],trialNerror,2010-11-21T15:45Z,"New episodes of Ghost Adventures for some reason seems the hardest to get of the ghost shows.  I mean, a GOOD version and not just some webrip.  No idea why.  
Oh, if only I had a TV tuner card for the PC.

@trialNerror, I'd just like to know your process for ripping these to .avi that's playable on a DVD player.  Thanks for your ups also!"
[T],trialNerror,2010-11-21T18:55Z,"Personally I use ConvertXtoDVD.
Easy to use.  Nice default templates.
6 episodes will fit on one disc."

Thanks for the up!"
