,MrMouthy,2010-11-21T22:48Z,Any chance you could upload a complete 320kbps version?
[V],jainmehul,2010-11-22T06:50Z,"^^
i dont upload 320kbps.... bcoz this is better than 320... believe me..its better"
,arunningg,2010-11-23T00:22Z,"Just a question JAINMEHUL,    What is the difference between vbr and 320.  I personally think Vbr is better quality, but maybe im trippin. lol   Is this straight from the cd? It always seems majority of the people are always getting the 320 instead of the VBR???  why? which one is better? "
,Danman42,2010-11-24T12:49Z,"I will give u a quick break down arunningg. All the difference in 320 and VBR is Size. It is like if u convert a Standard definition movie to HD it looks exactly the same just the size is triple.  So what they those up-loaders do is convert a VBR to 320kb constant. Is just a waste of space. But the retards that download them believe it is bigger so it is better quality but it is impossible to make sound any better then the bitrate it already as. 

Maybe not quick but a fact"
[V],jainmehul,2010-11-25T07:26Z,"rightly said ""Danman42"" you gave the perfect example...

@arunningg:-
lots of people here prefer 320kbps bcoz its the highest bitrate a mp3 file can offer,but i will recommend you this one.... also VBR plays better in professional devices than 320kbps..... VBR gives different bitrate in each and every MS of a song which gives a better output... 320kbps is like a forced constant bitrate.....

also lods of 320kbps here are transcodes (eg :- NoFs torrent's).... 
to check whether a 320kbps is real download this software calles spectro :-
http://spectro.enpts.com/download.php 

open a 320kbps in spectro,if the cutoff isn't more than or =20.3 for 70% of the albums songs than get that shit out of ur PC

,arunningg,2010-11-28T21:23Z,"what do you mean  other people are reencoded??     thats probably i never donwoload NoFs torrent's because they all sound funny, lol    Is this rip directly from the actual cd??"
[V],jainmehul,2010-11-29T02:29Z,"@arunningg :-

Yes.... It is the quality tells you everything... :)"
