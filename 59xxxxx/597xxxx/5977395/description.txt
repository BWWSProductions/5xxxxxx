Episode 3: Up in Smoke

This episode, the remaining 7 drivers attempt to get turned around in our tightly designed 3 Point Turn Challenge. It should be as easy as 1...2...3 but we are dealing with Canada's Worst Drivers. Then, our drivers attempt to find balance as they try to manoeuvre a standard vehicle on a huge teeter totter. For some, this challenge goes up in smoke. Later, Canada's Worst show us what they know about road signs. Knowing that they all drive among us, the answers may amaze you. Finally, we skid into the last challenge as our horrendous 7 attempt to remain in control after learning the fundamentals of Threshold Braking.

One driver graduates and heads home after showing significant advancement and our experts continue to study closely to determine who will be Canada's Worst Driver.
