Jane (German band)
Band history
Their debut album 'Together' is considered by fans to be one of the iconic Progressive Rock albums of all time. The band has been through a lot of line-up changes and records on recent years under 'Peter Panka's Jane', 'Werner Nadolny's Jane', and 'Klaus Hess's Jane' (a.k.a. 'Mother Jane'). One of their latest releases available in Germany is 'Voices' which has been critically acclaimed by the fans and critics alike. Jane can be seen in the 'Krautrock Meeting' concert film recently released on DVD. Alongside Eloy, Ramses and Birth Control, Jane are regarded as one of the best Krautrock groups with a devoted following which can be traced to Germany and Austria. Peter Panka (the main founder of Jane) died on June 28, 2007. The remaining members of the band toured Germany & Austria in 2007 alongside Fritz Randow and Arndt Schulz in memory of Peter Panka. Cool & Easy Records (Jane's official record label) has announced series of rarities titled 'The Lost Tapes' and a new DVD 'Phoenix' for future release. Tribute To Peter Panka a live concert DVD was released in 2008. A new album titled 'Traces' was released in December 2009.
