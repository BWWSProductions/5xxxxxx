,bbatmanx3,2011-06-06T13:39Z,"Spoken language - Cantonese
Audio - 9/10
Quality - 9/10

The whole movie was amazing, there was nothing wrong with it at all. EXCEPT for the last 10 seconds of the movie, where the quality and audio stuffed up a bit. But 10 seconds out of like 1 hour and 35 minutes. Very worth it.

Recommended by me. (:"
,tows,2012-01-15T16:26Z,"Awesome work! 
I've been looking for the original version of this for ages. Those who want to hear this in English, don't. The dub is noot good. Learn to read.

There is a problem though. The ending is cut off. I don't know about others but that pisses me off big time. Please, if u can, correct it! (Don't be like that *********** klaxxon.)
Oh and the last 5 seconds of the movie part does not have any audio. neither does the ending after that..."
