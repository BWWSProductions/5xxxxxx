Video = 24 fps 1280 x 756 MPEG-4 AVC x.264

Audio = 224 kbps .ac3 @ 48 KHz

Special thanks to JB59 for the original and great uploaded .avi

I have done many special tricks here to increase quality. Check it, you will enjoy!

Plus, the video card you have can now accelerate the video.

IVTC (inverse telecine), de-blocking, sharpening, black bars cropped and other things applied.

Video is as is in the screen shot. No cropping done to that at all compared to the vid.

Enjoy!

(I'll be doing the same thing for the Night Version soon. Look for it here or on my account name.)


PS3 and XBOX360 compatible.
