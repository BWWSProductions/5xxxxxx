,midurix,2010-12-10T17:37Z,"Why is xvid so popular for 720p rips???????
H264 is so so so much better, please answer me why do you still use xvid? The quality of this 2.45GB rip would equal a 1.2GB-1.8GB H264 copy, it makes no sense to use xvid for anything but standard definition stuff."
,steviedvd,2010-12-19T14:25Z,"Xvid works on PS3 mate that might be why its used,No complaints here love these torrent.thanx all"

,Josh8697,2011-01-01T09:01Z,"if you don't mind me asking, what program did you use to render this into a avi? or did you just rip it from the BR as a avi?"
,Josh8697,2011-01-01T09:01Z,btw very nice quality.
,_mune,2011-01-02T02:57Z,Thanks froggie
,ultimagic,2011-01-02T16:53Z,xvid is only used for dvdrip and h264 for blu ray and HDDVD. i don't agree with brrip to xvid. anyway thanks for the effort. never thought that ps3 can read xvid. i only use h264 mp4.
,FreakinX,2011-01-08T16:23Z,"For subs go to subscene, damn noobs:D"
