Music : Rock : Other quality




This CD is a mixture of rare and unreleased material that neatly tells the full story of the Ron Keel fronted band that ripped the LA club scene up in the early to mid eighties. With sleeve notes by Ron himself, a selection of rare photos and even some live Malmsteen era material, there's a lot on offer. It should be pointed out here that the live material is not of the same high quality of the studio material but was, because of its vintage and archive value, considered worthy of inclusion.â€¦One for true lovers of that 80's party rock sound still so beloved by so many!
