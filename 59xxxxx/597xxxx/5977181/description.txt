SPIN Magazine, December 2010.pdf

Spin is a music magazine. Founded in 1985 by publisher Bob Guccione Jr. 
It competes with industry stalwart Rolling Stone. Madonna was the artist 
on the cover of the first issue. In its early years, the magazine was noted for 
its broad music coverage with an emphasis on college-oriented rock music and 
on the ongoing emergence of hip-hop. The magazine was eclectic and bold, 
if sometimes haphazard. It pointedly provided a national alternative to 
the Rolling Stone's more establishment-oriented style.
