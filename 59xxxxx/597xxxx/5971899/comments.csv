,ponku,2010-11-21T06:52Z,"Awesome, thanks very much."
,r0ttiem0m,2010-11-21T07:35Z,Thanks and I'll go to Discovery Channel right now and put in an email.  I love ghost lab as well!
,Nickyboy7,2010-11-21T13:10Z,"Could you please upload the latest Ghost Adventures episode. As for complaints. I think Ghost Lab are guilty of the same things other paranormal shows are guilty of. Exploiting the dead. They shout and yell to get a reaction so they can get some evidence then do a hive five with each other. It's all a bit sick really.

The dead are not stupid, if you think you can turn out the lights and creep up on a spirit you are dumber than you look. This is my main complaint with these shows. Ghost lab are just more blatant in their exploitation. There is nothing these sick bastards will not do. Even putting a little girls dress out near a train as it comes past. where she was hit and killed by a train. Just so they can get some evidence.

Sick fucks...seriously."
,Nickyboy7,2010-11-21T13:30Z,"Just like to add that you are the best uploader of shows like this, keep up the good work."
,nanunanu,2010-11-21T15:01Z,Thank you.
,r0ttiem0m,2010-11-21T22:59Z,"Nickyboy....What are you even doing here if you don't like ""these types"" of shows?  I think you need to download Barney or something more fitting to your developmental age. Idiot.

Thanks trialNerror, your ups are fantastic as usual!"
,ponku,2010-11-23T06:59Z,"A little heads up about the time slot business; Discovery had hundreds of requests to move the show back to it's regular slot and the remaining shows will air at it's old time again. 

Go go internauts!"
[T],trialNerror,2010-11-23T15:40Z,@ ponku:  I noticed you are rather well informed about what's coming ahead for television.  Well done and thank you for your shared knowledge. 
,ponku,2010-11-23T22:27Z,"I've got a blog where I link all these torrents and try to stay on top of what's going on.

Not sure about linking to it here though."
[T],trialNerror,2010-11-27T14:20Z,"This show better not get pulled. 

I hope your blog is more accurate than the chatter all over the Discovery channel forums for the show.  

A friend of mine was even saying there wasn't any feedback from the guys on twitter and also that a sudden change of schedule to 2 AM is usually like a ""kiss of death""."
