I just played Cars to check, a compressed DVD-R version, and of course it had some small pixelation jaggies at 1:1 scale, but not as large as this movie. So I'd give the quality of this one a thumbs down."

The quality of this movie is like 500MB upsized to 3.43GB. Plus VLC states ""VLC can't recognize the input's format:....txt"" every time it's played. Would not recommend download."
