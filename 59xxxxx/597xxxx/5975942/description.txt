- Video Report From Afghanistan: How the U.S. Counter-insurgency Campaign Is Failing

At a conference in Portugal over the weekend, NATO countries agreed to hand over responsibility for Afghanistan's security to Afghan forces by the end of 2014. In his speech, President Obama claimed there has been significant progress in the fight against the Taliban. But reports from the ground in Afghanistan question these upbeat claims about the ongoing NATO operation. Last spring, NATO launched a major operation in the Taliban-held town of Marjah.

- Anthony DePalma on "City of Dust: Illness, Arrogance and 9/11"

We speak with Anthony DePalma, author of the new book, City of Dust: Illness, Arrogance and 9/11. "The dust becomes a metaphor," DePalma said, "because after those statements come out [about the air being safe to breathe], the rest of the people in New York were left without about the ability to believe anyone. Their trust crumbled, just the way the towers crumbled."

The distinguished scholar and best-selling author Chalmers Johnson has died. He passed away in California on Saturday afternoon at the age of 79. During the Cold War, he served as a consultant to the Central Intelligence Agency and was a supporter of the Vietnam War, however, later became a leading critic of U.S. militarism and imperialism. He wrote the book, "Blowback: The Costs and Consequences of American Empire" in 2000, which became a bestseller after the 9/11 attacks. He went on to complete what would become a trilogy about American empire. Today we re-air part of our last interview with Chalmers Johnson from 2007.
