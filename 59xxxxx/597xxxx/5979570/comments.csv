A/V quality is good.

For some reason it took forever to DL this torrent, though there appeared to be enough seeders.

I'll share to a ratio of 2.

The show itself is tres lame....."

Whatever happened, it doesn't seem to have been ripped properly...I'm actually attempting to re-encode those now, but I don't know if it'll even work...everything else works, so far..."
,Zarod,2012-04-23T09:19Z,"Oh yah...and 16, too...

But...my re-encoding is working, just tested 14 and it's fine now.  So again, whatever happened, they (14, 15, and 16) weren't ripped and encoded properly.

Anyway...thanks for the upload!!"
