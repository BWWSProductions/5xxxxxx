***



Archive format: ISO image. Burn it or mount with Alcohol 120%, Daemon Tools etc.



Working serials and keygen are included.



There are some bugs.

1) Sometimes Document Express Enterprise unexpectedly exits just after loading with error info about "some missing/incorrect directory {0}". The reason is unknown (?), but this program is easily recovered by reinstalling it (you can just choose "Repair/Upgrade" option of installer).

2) Some PDFs can't be converted to DjVu, probably because of pdftodjvu using outdated GhostScript engine version 8.14. Unfortunately, it cannot be upgraded to the recent versions without breaking the functionality of pdftodjvu.

3) Sometimes IRIS OCR engine doesn't like some pages, so it doesn't produce text layer there. Fortunately, alternative OCR software (such as FineReader) can be used later to do OCR in DjVu documents.
