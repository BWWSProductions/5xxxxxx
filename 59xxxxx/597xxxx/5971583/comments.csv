,newersayd,2011-07-28T15:15Z,"Cracks and keygens are often detected by antivirus software as ""suspicious"", ""malware"" etc.
These utilities often use unusual methods of protection (e. g. packing with compressors, patching etc.) which make them look like malware for antiviruses.
Sometimes cracks and keygens are added to antivirus databases by request of original software developers.
It's not the reason to panic. If you fear to be infected, use antiviruses, virtual machines etc."
