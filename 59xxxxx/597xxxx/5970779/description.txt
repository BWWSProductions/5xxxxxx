'Gravity' is the eleventh studio album from Irish pop outfit Westlife. Working alongside producer John Shanks (Take That, Backstreet Boys, Bon Jovi), the band's contemporary pop sound has evolved, whilst retaining their emotive ballad style. The album title came from a fan's suggestion on Twitter of using a lyric from first single 'Safe', which was subsequently adopted by the band.
