,itzcrazy,2010-11-01T08:11Z,any feedback on this one?
,itzcrazy,2010-11-01T08:56Z,"just finished dl not bad for cam, a/8 v/8 (for cam)"
,Alere0n,2010-11-01T15:57Z,"Not really watchable. The video isn't bad, but the audio is hard to understand at key parts, and this is a movie that really relies on audio to move the plot along, especially during dark moments. Not a diss on the uploader as you can tell some work was put into it, but the quality just wasn't there in the source. Hold out for a Telesync."
,Alere0n,2010-11-02T04:46Z,"Update: The audio gets much worse for the last 10 minutes of the film (at about 1h4m) and you basically can't understand anything, especially near the climax and the end. Not worth the download."
