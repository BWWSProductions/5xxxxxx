Joan Jett and the Blackhearts - Do You Wanna Touch Me [Euro tv promo].VOB 



HQ very rare European tv promo music video.  "Do You Wanna Touch Me", also 
referred to as "Do You Wanna Touch Me? (Oh Yeah)" is a glam rock song 
written by Gary Glitter. The song was later covered by rock singer Joan 
Jett in 1982, reaching number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. A cover of the 
song by Joan Jett from her 1981 album Bad Reputation appears in a 2008 TV 
commercial for Hewlett-Packard's TouchSmart computers. The ad was pulled 
from TV when HP learned that Glitter, now a convicted child molester, had 
written the song. On 29 October 2008, it was reported that Glitter will 
receive Â£100,000 in royalties from Hewlett Packard for this advertisement.
