,MovieX101,2010-10-31T01:14Z,@ Neonrainbow - Can you post a BRRIP?
,alhillerus,2010-10-31T01:30Z,Sllllllllooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow
,.Leto.,2010-10-31T01:35Z,Judging by the screenshots quality seems better than the 1.4GB arrow release (which is a bit too dark). Res and bitrate are also superior here. This looks like the best version available at the moment.
,alhillerus,2010-10-31T01:36Z,screenshots look great. anybody downloaded already?
[V],neon,2010-10-31T01:52Z,brrip should only be a couple of days or so 
,rogamosh,2010-10-31T02:32Z,Thanks For The Movie & Specially For The 5.1 Surround.......
,arian25,2010-10-31T04:15Z,"Probably the best copy so far. Thanx neo.


PS- Your subs are usually bad, please do something about that."
,oscargp,2010-10-31T06:46Z,"well seems ok
special thanks for the 5.1 audio,
i really wanted it 

ill be seeding "
,the.count,2010-10-31T07:51Z,Great up! Thanks a lot!
,arian25,2010-10-31T08:10Z,"I am watching it now, the video quality is good(definitely better than rest of the rips except for ViSiON rip may be...which is as good as this one in terms of video quality). The audio, on the other hand, is amazing. So, definitely go for it.

PS- The download speed was quite good for my connection. Finished at an avg of 292 kbps in a 4 mbps connection."
,typ050212,2010-10-31T09:15Z,"is the audio in synch, as the one by arrow is out of sync."
,LongTimeNoPee,2010-10-31T12:29Z,Nice! I'm downloading at almost full speed. Will be done in under an hour. :)
,lazopper,2010-10-31T13:11Z,"hm, I finished downloading 47% of the file and when I play it, audio and video are out of sync. 

Is this torrent working properly for others here?"
,arian25,2010-10-31T14:10Z,"@lazopper- No prob here, working just fine. Try playing it with a different player. And if you are running any java based program(like for e.g. - vuze) or any another heavy program(bitcomet), then exit it and try playing the movie. MPC works best in my pc, try MPC if you're having synching issues with vlc or kmplayer."
,arian25,2010-10-31T14:12Z,"By the way, what happened to this torrent? When i was downloading it, it had more than 800 seeders & 3000+ leechers!!!!"
,amusta3,2010-10-31T14:50Z,slooooooooooooooooooooooow
,Rapier_Wit,2010-10-31T16:08Z,Def the best I've seen and heard so far. Will do nicely til the BD hits. Big thanks.
[V],neon,2010-10-31T18:22Z,"ive double checked this and its in sync...no probs

this has hundreds of seeders and leechers ...not showing up just now "
,Nightblade88,2010-10-31T22:40Z,"Wow! What a fantastic movie!
Very few films have the power to engage you like this one does.

A massive thank you to neonrainbow for such a high quality rip.
Cheers!"
