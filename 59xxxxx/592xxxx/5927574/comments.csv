,bigdoug,2010-11-02T12:18Z,somebody confirm this?
,Naaw,2010-11-02T12:53Z,"yes, ask after CD when i save. no good."
,Naaw,2010-11-02T13:11Z,"Mount the Russian version of the game (FM2011-P2P) and then u can save and play, that Iso works as a crack! i installed armadas version then i mounted the Russian version of the game and it works fine as crack :)"
,KiLLeRSweeT,2010-11-02T14:16Z,"nooba, it works just fine, just after the book...."

,einarb,2010-11-02T20:21Z,Works until you save the game for me. Then you have too restart the game
,ethertaster,2010-11-03T19:04Z,Worst crack ever...
[V],AlbaGuBrath,2010-11-03T19:26Z,"^^^ Wow strong words!! Care to elaborate? not for me as i never used it, i downloaded the P2P release, but for others considering downloading this? Its nice to be nice!!"
,ethertaster,2010-11-04T12:14Z,"It's worst crack ever because it doesn't work. Yes it gets you inside the game, but once you try to save the game promps for a disc, hence you can't save games wich is worthless..."
