3. Run the game and go to preferences and change the game language to whichever suits you

100% Legit, thanks uploader"

,ppereira1,2010-11-02T16:15Z,"either burn the iso file on a dvd or mount virtual drive

run setup, install the game offline mode (need the dvd or virtual drive of the dvd)

after installing copy the english files to where you installed the game > Sports Interactive > Football Manager 2011 Russian > data > languages

then run the game go to preferences and change it to english (or other language if you have)




remember you will allways need the dvd or the virtual drive to play if you installed offline mode

[T],nlx_78,2010-11-04T18:03Z,"Last post:

What i like they improved in 2011:

- Better graphics (rain, night with lights etc etc)
- You can let your assistant automatic put the instructions for each opponent without having to that yourself (i know, only 2 clicks, but still) before the match and during half time. 
- When you watch highlights and the replay on and you make an offside goal, it will show in replay with lines added just like on TV.
- You can set a camera to view the goals in replay, so another view than your normal view
- Agents offer players to you 
- When you finished a game you see 1 screen with best players, man of match Ã¡nd the standings in the competition, no need to look that up manually after. 
- The training is much better
- My beloved Feyenoord Rotterdam won the first 3 matches :) That's better than in real life :(

Ok, well these are just some points. You all have fun :) "

When everything has downloaded, mount the image with Daemon Tools and it installs everything, but, take the offline installation.

Then, you need to press the ""fm"" icon to play the game, which many of you dont know how to do.
