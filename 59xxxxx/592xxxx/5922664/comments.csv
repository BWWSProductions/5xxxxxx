,Barger,2010-11-23T19:26Z,The spin fix doesn't work in Singleplayer mode =/
,Barger,2010-11-24T13:54Z,"Nevermind...
Plug out your joystick or any other stuff than the keyboard and mouse and this should be resolved. Just reinstall the game after you've unplugged the devices and you shouldn't spin anymore"
