,AsssKisser666,2010-11-02T23:27Z,"This FW version is corrupt, thats why its crashing for some people. The video partiton is corrupted, the T.P version seems to be working, I just havent found it yet?!"
,AsssKisser666,2010-11-02T23:40Z,"Dont download this one. Or any of the -FW versions, I have downloaded two already and both had corrupted video partitions with Abgx. The T.P version seems to be the right one, im not sure if any of the versions on TPB is that one, some of them are only called [RF] or some spanish shit, so you propably need to download all of those too to find the correct version that isnt corrupted."

This is a abgx pic of the T.P version, as you can see it is correct. Both -FW version I download failed abgx, with the video partition and I have seen some posting that the game crashes in singleplayer, that would explain it."
