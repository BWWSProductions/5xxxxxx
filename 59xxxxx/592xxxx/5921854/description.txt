Thursday October 28 at 9 pm ET on CBC-TV

Synopsis
Itâ€™s that moment we all dread: we meet someone we know, but suddenly canâ€™t recall his name. Or we forget where we put our purse, our wallet, our keys.  Sometimes we canâ€™t remember the word for the uh â€¦ câ€™mon, you know, the uh, thing-a-ma-jig to wash the salad. And by the way, where exactly did we park the car?

Memory loss is the second greatest health fear for Canadians, after cancer. And memory loss is a growing epidemic, as we live longer, our brains age, and we have more and more information to forget. Throw in the information overload from new technologies. The result: T.M.I. â€“ Too Much Information! No wonder we have â€œbrain crampsâ€ and forget things. Are we all doomed to lose our minds? Or are there ways to keep our memories - and even make them better? If you can lose your memory, can you find it?

To find answers to these big questions, Where Did I Put...My Memory? takes viewers on an unforgettable journey around the world
