,yoshinatsu,2010-11-03T02:01Z,Is this a real CD rip or just the same old upconverted copy of the MySpace rip?

Sure it's better than the ""Myspace rip"", but seems like you had too aggressive setting for lowpass filter in your mp3 encoder?! The highest frequencies are missing."
,yoshinatsu,2010-11-04T01:15Z,"Yeah, that's why I asked, it sounds really weird. Because I have a 192kbps rip of this album and it sounds slightly better than this 320kbps one."
