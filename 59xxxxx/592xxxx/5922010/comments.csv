,mark123321,2010-10-30T21:06Z,Cant wait for inception....
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-30T21:34Z,"Inception would be here at 23:20 CET. Like 2 hours from now.

Sanctuary would go up as first thing tomorrow.

@punk: That is TPB malfunctioning - comments are not removed, they just appear with some random delay.

Fringe was on break - next week is normal airing. Many other shows would be off next week. Why? I do not know, consult on-line sources. tvrage dot com is what I use.

ALL: Read the schedule. You'll get the idea. However, some ""shifting"" would be done (by me) and some clean-up (also by me) due to my personal reasons of purely medical nature."
