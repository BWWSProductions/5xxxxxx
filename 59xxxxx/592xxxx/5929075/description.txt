This is for every undertaker fans. I have copy this from youtube and make it to one avi file.
It is 4 hour 27 minuts
The sound is Mono and Stero
Quality VHS

Big thanks to the original uploaders

The first match is:

From WWF Raw is War in July 19th, 1999 - Six Days Before Fully Loaded

The Undertaker vs Triple H - The winner will face Stone Cold Steve Austin for the WWF Championship
in a First Blood End Of An Era Match at Fully Loaded.


This match is from July 25th, 1999 - at Fully Loaded 


The main event at Fully Loaded 1999 sees Stone Cold Steve Austin
go head-to-head with The Undertaker in a first blood match with far more
than Austin's gold on the line; should The Undertaker see victory, Stone Cold
can never be champion again. Should the opposite occur, Mr. McMahon will never appear on television or interfere with Stone Cold's career ever again.

And this is 

Every Undertaker & Big Show (The Unholy Alliance)
appearance from late July to late September 1999.
