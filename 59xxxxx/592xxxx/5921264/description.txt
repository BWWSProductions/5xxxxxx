They Live [1988] DvdRip XviD   Action | Horror | Sci-Fi | Thriller
Directed by John Carpenter and starring American Wrestler 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper This
movie became a cult classic in the late eighties early nineties and is an allegory
about the way the population is treated by its rulers.And tries to explain why they
are so different in opinion to the rest of society.
It was Carpenters wake up call to what he saw happening around him.
How laws were being drafted to keep the population subjugated! 
How everything was being designed to take peoples money!
How subliminal messages were introduced.Such as product placing on TV!

"I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass, and I'm all out of bubble gum"
This film has a commentary as relevant today as in the 80s. Upper class people are 
actually aliens corrupting America. And the only way to see them is to wear special 
sunglasses that our hero, Nada, stumbles upon. This film has some cool ideas: the 
way all magazines and signs have subliminal messages, the paranoia, and the 
B-movie-on-purpose-so-it-feels-like-a-B-movie feel. It also has some really great 
cheesy one liners which I don't wish to spoil. Let it be known though, by the end 
of the movie you might just see a little of Ash from Evil Dead in Nada. The film 
also has a fight scene around the middle that is particularly funny to watch because 
it keeps going forever.
Uploader comment... purposely made to look like a B Movie and panned by the critics.
Its worth the download just to look at Meg Fosters eyes! And this movie led to things
like Hulk Hogan and The Rock becoming movie actors in Roddy Pipers Wake. In my opinion More 
relevent today than it was in the late eightees. Apparently a re-make is due!
One of my favourite movies of all time! Sad bastard that I am!
