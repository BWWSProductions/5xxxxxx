,ZenRhino,2010-10-31T19:22Z,hopefully this is legit... cause I can't believe obody has released this by now!!!
,ZenRhino,2010-10-31T19:24Z,"one thing against this is that it says it was downloaded from demonoid, but the torrent isn't over there at all"
,ZenRhino,2010-10-31T19:26Z,and the user being anon doesn't give me any confidence... but I'll check it out & let you know what I find out
,shimigami777,2010-10-31T20:30Z,"A copy is going around by this name. If this isn't real though, I got it from here:

I can upload it if need be."

,Fnnylgrnd,2010-10-31T22:22Z,"I'm at 70% and opened it in VLC, it's real.  And looks good. "
,zcheeley,2010-10-31T23:22Z,"This is legit, i played a clip while downloading"
,eee_miffo,2010-11-01T00:10Z,All good and legit. Thanks for the up.
,LanceMJ,2010-11-01T00:30Z,"Works great. Quality was acceptable - looks like a TV rip from Comedy Central HD. 
I was there yesterday and enjoyed this very much - makes me proud to be an American. 
Will send this along to some boys over seas in Iraq to give them something to be proud of too."
,elkang,2010-11-01T02:29Z,"This is indeed legit from Comedy Central HD. Let's be civil here and if we can't be reasonable - just turn and engage someone else.

Otherwise, good luck arguing with strangers on the internet!"
,pxpierre,2010-11-01T04:05Z,"""makes me proud to be an American"" - HAHA! One lonely drop of rain water in the ocean of insanity of the US politic$.

Collective amnesia: you will give soon control to the republicans who dig you into a giant hole just 2 years ago.

US senate: the most unrepresentative institutions in the entire western world where 2 guys of Nebraska weight the same same as 2 senators for California. What a joke.

And you think your are the beacon of democracy. :-)"
,artantipop,2010-11-01T04:20Z,"I downloaded this torrent and it's not a ''legend of the seeker'' episode, it's the rally to restore sanity!"
[V],err0001,2010-11-01T05:45Z,"One more vote for legit.

I downloaded the whole thing and checked about 10 spots at random and it looks fine to me."
,fileerror404,2010-11-01T13:06Z,"Thanks a lot for the upload! Was looking everywhere. Very nice quality video, excellent audio.

,IHeartBoobies,2010-11-02T01:02Z,Anyone find an HD rip of this anywhere? :(
,BudShiz,2010-11-02T01:51Z,"Anybody knows where these rare sound errors are coming from? i watched parts of it live streamed and i heard them there too, seems to be an actual problem they had. Still, video and audio are great"
,Modibo,2011-03-24T04:19Z,thx guys
