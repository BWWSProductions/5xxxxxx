October 1970, under the pretext of waging war against the terrorist group Front de liberation du Quebec, the Canadian Parliament vote the War's Measures Act. Police and Army used it and tried to break-up popular groups in the Province of Quebec. More then 400 peoples were arrested for what's look like there social activities. No accusation was ever put against them. This is their story.


Les ordres has been rated by critics as one of the best Canadian films ever made. It subtly blends fiction and documentary realism in a chilling portrait of what can happen to a liberal democracy when the state imposes its power.
