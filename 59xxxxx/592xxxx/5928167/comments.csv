""I think it's BS that netflix has series 1, 3 and 4, but not 2. ""


Apparently they only have 1 and 4 now. I can't find 3 anywhere. I would have watched 1, 3, 4 onl Netflix and ordered the discs for 2. But since even Netflix is trying to screw us now, I came here."

,Agentx619,2011-09-05T08:26Z,"thanks alot man, and jeez lol at the people that think this got a virus , its a freaking .avi file. for fks sake do your homework before leaving dumb comments"
,purplebay,2011-09-10T17:53Z,"@Agentx619 all files can have hidden suffixes, meaning it could look like a dot avi file but it is not. All files can have malicious code in them and dont even need clicking to work. sorry of all the comments yours is the dumbest... and most naive"
,RJ737,2011-09-25T17:01Z,Thanks for this torrent. Watched season 1 so far and quality is more then enough for my 4:3 CRT ;)

,tpbfan0,2011-12-27T03:22Z,"@purplebay
Lol maybe if you have 0 computing knowledge. A .avi file cannot contain a virus (sorry). If it is something like foo.avi.exe, yes, could be a virus (windows will hide the last extension). But then it's not a .avi file. No, not everything can have malicious code in it.

-1 internets for spewing nonsense"
,Wh1T3h4Ck5,2012-01-02T03:26Z,"Great torrent, A9 V8

@tpbfan0: you're so wrong. EVERYTHING can contain malicious code!!! But everything cant be executed,  that's difference. AVI file like almost every other kind of multimedia file-formats can contain viruses and THESE VIRUSES CAN BE EXECUTED ON TARGET MACHINE (not directly like exe, msi, but, com, but through player's tag reader or plugin container). True, its really rare to find viruses inside AVI files (because most players today are well protected), but THEY STILL CAN INFECT COMPUTERS. Your computer can execute malicious code from types like MP3, GIF, JPEG, MOV, DAT, etc. even from BMP files in specific situation.

BTW, this torrent doesn't contain viruses!"
