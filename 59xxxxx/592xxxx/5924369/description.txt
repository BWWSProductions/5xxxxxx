I had some spare time and it's just before April 20th, so I decided to make a mix of all your favorite stoner beats. It's full of samples, quotes and scratches regarding marijuana as well as downtempo beats. Whether you smoke lots of pot or you don't and just enjoy downtempo hiphop, I'm sure you'll dig this mix. Any and all feedback will be appreciated and repped.
