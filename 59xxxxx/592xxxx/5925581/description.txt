===========

After watching a video in a Web site, you may want to save the video file
into your local disk for playing it offline in the future. If the video
file is stored in your browser's cache, this utility can help you to
extract the video file from the cache and save it for watching it in the
future.
It automatically scans the entire cache of Internet Explorer and
Mozilla-based Web browsers (Including Firefox) and finds all video files
that are currently stored in it. It allows you to easily copy the cached
video files into another folder for playing/watching them in the future.
If you have a movie player that is configured to play flv files, it also
allows you to play the video directly from your browser's cache.

With VideoCacheView, you can easily save the downloaded .flv files of
many popular video sharing sites, like YouTube, Metacafe, Putfile, and
more...

Using VideoCacheView
====================

VideoCacheView doesn't require any installation process or additional DLL
files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file
(VideoCacheView.exe)
After running VideoCacheView, it scan the cache folders of your Internet
Explorer and Mozilla browsers, as well as the temporary folder of
Windows. Wait 5 - 30 seconds until the scanning process is finished, and
the main window of VideoCacheView should display all the video files that
are currently in cache.

After the video list is displayed, you can use one of the following
options, assuming that the video files are stored in the cache ('In
Cache' = Yes):
* Play Selected File: Allows you to play the video file directly from
the cache, assuming that you have a video player that is configured to
play .flv files.
* Copy Selected Files To: Allows to copy the video files from the cache
into another folder, so you will be able to play them in the future.

If you have a video file that is not stored in the cache ('In Cache' =
No), you can use the 'Open Download URL In Browser' option (F8) in order
to download the video file. You can also use the 'Copy Download URLs'
option (Ctrl+U) to copy the download URLs to the clipboard, and then use
then in your browser or in other download software.
Be aware that some Web sites may not allow you to download a video file
in this way.
