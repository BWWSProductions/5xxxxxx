The CD title, lest there be any confusion, doesn't mean that this is Rusby's tenth album (it isn't), but serves notice that this release celebrates her first decade as a performing artist. In rock music circles, ten years equals the length of time that separates the "pre-Beatle" and "post-Hendrix" eras, so Rusby would probably be regarded as something of a veteran. The deep waters of traditional folk music flow in a somewhat slower fashion, to the extent that it's not uncommon to still see Rusby described as a "new" or "emerging" performer, so 10 can be viewed as a clear coming of age statement. It can also be seen as clear evidence of her growing appeal to an international audience, as this release appears not only on her own, Yorkshire based "Pure Records" but is also "under license" to Compass Records in Nashville
