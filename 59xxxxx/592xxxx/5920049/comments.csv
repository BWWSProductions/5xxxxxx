,gangstarbbbb,2010-10-30T15:35Z,"thnx 20/40

Hope your next upload will be Inception, It just came out on the net"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-30T17:02Z,"@gangstarbbbb: I know, but sorely I would up one tomorrow. I do not appreciate getting smacked for indulging other people. "
,gangstarbbbb,2010-10-30T19:58Z,"Didn't mean to disrespect, sure there are other releases, i just was hoping you could upload one, because I prefer your releases"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-31T00:18Z,"@gangstarbbbb: I am not JUST an uploader. I encode ALL files I put up - unlike 99% of other uploaders.

It is disrespectful - what you've just said. Out there are hundredths of Inception torrents - and you can go there and burn handful of mega more - you obviously doesn't care.

And do not waste my time on reading your thoughts - you may keep them for yourself and somehow, things would be either as they are or better."
,gangstarbbbb,2010-10-31T13:52Z,"@twentyforty 
Wow, here is me, giving you a compliment, and you, spitting in my face. When I said ""Hope your next upload will be Inception, It just came out on the net"", What I meant by it was that inception finely came out. And I know you encode them yourself, That's why I said I prefer ""YOUR RELEASES"". I didn't say you should upload the SAME thing, that would be very stupid for me to ask. So, Again, I didn't mean to disrespect, but I don't appreciate you snappin at me like that."
