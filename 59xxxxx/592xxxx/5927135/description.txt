	Much of the music on this LP is quite essential for any serious jazz library. Although Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane played together for several months in 1957, until the discovery of a live tape (which has been issued on Blue Note), the music on this record was all that existed of their historic collaboration. Coltrane developed rapidly during his period with Monk and he is heard in brilliant form on Trinkle, Tinkle* and *Nutty.*

Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane is a 1957 album by Thelonious Monk. It was recorded while Monk was engaged in a six-month stay at New Yorks legendary Five Spot in 1957 with his quartet of the time, which included Coltrane. While this album features this quartet on only three tracks - *Ruby, My Dear*, *Trinkle, Tinkle* and *Nutty* - a more extensive collection can be found in *The Complete 1957 Riverside Recordings.*

Because of the historical significance of this album it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2007.

Personal Note

With my vinyl rips I try to catch the whole beauty of records. Therefore I don't use any post-processing or any sound improver. What you get is a clear and flat transfer.

For getting a clear sound I'll do an extended washing of each record with my RCM, which can take up to 30 minutes brushing for each side. Resistant ticks and clicks I try to remove as good as possible, but the priority is not to loose any musical information.

Surface noises, as long they are not to high, are left in place. Only on bad pressings or on records recorded with extremly low level I do a fade in-/-out. As John Peel said, 'Life is full of surface noises'. In some cases this means I have to do a compromise... The result has to pass my personal quality criteria which is IMO quite high.
