,neeru,2010-11-02T21:46Z,"HI twentyforty!! BIG fan of your work

could you please restrict the size of tv show packs (to lets say packs/parts of 700 mb)?
problem with big downloads is that lesser number of ppl seed and it takes forever to dowload to be able to seed."
,lilars26,2010-11-02T21:55Z,Thank you 20-40.
,fourpointfivehertz,2010-11-03T02:28Z,"Hey man, I know you probably dont like questions like this, but just wondered why you dropped caprica and event? Not enough interest?

Id also like to say, I love you torrents. Not only are they downloadable with a slow connection (thanks heaps for that!), but youve often got the shows I like, sci-fi and mystery stuffz. You got good taste. So thanks man for all the good workz :)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-03T07:00Z,"@fourpointfivehertz: I watch The Event but it hasn't been aired this week. Caprica was canceled last week, remaining episodes would be aired in 2011."
,c0di3,2010-12-23T10:02Z,Any chance you could do Weeds S06E11 and up for iPod Touch?  I can't find it anywhere!  It would be much appreciated!
