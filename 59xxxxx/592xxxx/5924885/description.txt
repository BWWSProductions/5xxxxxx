The wait was long! Handsomeboy Technique is back with a 2nd full-length album, successor to the acclaimed "Adleie Land" that took the world by surprise almost 4 years ago!

A few of the new tracks have been heard before on Second Royal's "vol.3" and "vol.4", and on HBT's "Magnificient Mass E.P." 12".
