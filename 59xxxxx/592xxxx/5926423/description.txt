Comments :
Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, 
stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, 
when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted 
player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made 
him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb 
is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back 
but only if he can accomplish the impossible-inception. Instead of the perfect heist, 
Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to 
steal an idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But 
no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous 
enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have 
seen coming.
