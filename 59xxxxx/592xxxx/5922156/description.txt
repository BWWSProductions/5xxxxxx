This monthâ€™s interviewee has been one of the truly original voices in British design and typography since the early 1990s. With his foundry Virus and a design practice built around vocal criticism of global politics and business, heâ€™s about as far from design establishment orthodoxy as you can possibly get. He has worked in close collaboration with renowned artists such as David Bowie and Damien Hirst. His typefaces are at once classically informed and subtly confrontational; with names like Exocet and Infidel, these fonts defy expectation with sophisticated layers of meaning and finely nuanced shades of grey â€” welcome to the cult of Jonathan Barnbrook, where nothing is ever simply black or white.
