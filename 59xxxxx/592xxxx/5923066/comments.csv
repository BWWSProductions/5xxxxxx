,typ050212,2010-10-31T08:10Z,"Is the audio in sync, as the one by Arrow is out of sync."
,Rizlakingsize,2010-10-31T13:46Z,use vlc player to watch you can adjust the audio/video sync....or use vlc to work out the difference and then convertxtodvd apply them settings in audio of the title set and VOILA perfect copy to watch on DVD......hope this helps ;-p
,Jokerdex14,2010-10-31T14:45Z,"but, yes if anyone was wondering, the audio is in sync"
,zdude555,2010-10-31T22:45Z,Is this like the Arrow/Maxspeed rip where few frames are missing at 1-16-56?
,zdude555,2010-11-01T09:47Z,"Avoid this rip. The re are several artifacts in it. I guess this noir just reencoded this one.
Noir dude, very bad -1"

,yes.gaschet,2010-11-01T13:42Z,"Can anyone confirm the true a/v quality?
Is it a true 10/10.. it appears hiest is saying it's v8 a7?"
,yes.gaschet,2010-11-01T13:47Z,"@Hiest - 

Can you please confirm the true a /v quality?
Is it a genuine 10/10 or are you saying it's v8/a7..?"
[V],hiest,2010-11-01T14:53Z,"@yes.gaschet 

My rating doesn't mean its bad
I gave low rating because it is not as good as all the other Noir releases, The reason is because of runtime, the movie is about 2 hours in runtime,
and there is a little sync problems in this release.

Otherwise the A/V would have been 10/10."

Ok, many thanks"
