Oppenheimer: "The Man Behind the Bomb" - "Countdown to Zero"


This year is the 65th anniversary of the first nuclear test in the U.S., and with it came the dawning of the very serious implications of this invention - ones that still haunt us today.

Filmmaker Lucy Walker recently premiered a documentary about the man who led that test, J. Robert Oppenheimer, at Sundance and screened it at Cannes.
