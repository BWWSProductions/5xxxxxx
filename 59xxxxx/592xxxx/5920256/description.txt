This Classic song \'Sign Your Name\' was a number one Hit back in the 80\'s in the UK for Singer Terance Trent D\'Arby and Sheryl gives it a modern feel and is really smokin\' on this.   Great Effort, nice Video.   Currently this Months Power Play on my International Discotheque\'s around the World.

This Promo Only copy is right off October\'s 2010 DVD and is now seeded from the Internet Backbone via a fibre optic 50mbps Server in North America.   It is Widescreen 16:9 format.   Enjoy

Other songs to look out for are the new ones from Pink - Raise your Glass and Pitbull\'s - Hey Baby.  I will up them just as soon as I get the Video\'s sourced.
