[V],prashant22,2010-11-01T16:12Z,"@jarman
enjoy mate..

@akindayimcan
i hope u like the movie..

@smasudi
u give too many suggestions...i hv a question why? why only to me????
btw i'll try to give the best...its totally your choice whose upload u want to download...n i prefer quality over size...what's the point in watching a movie which dont fell good to your eyes..."
,smasudi,2010-11-01T17:00Z,"@prashant..
coz u r the only one u do my requests asap..besides i like to watch movies.so i keep them for my personal collection..
regarding the size.. i did say to keep the size low but it was only for ur next three uploads.. not for ur every upload..because ur next uploads are already done and almost downloaded by everyone..thats y i told u to keep size low as compared to other uploaders..because the new downloaders will look for small size and good quality which can be provided only by who hasn't uploaded yet..and thats you bro..so cheers..."
,jarman007,2010-11-01T17:01Z,"@prashant

lmao on the comment to smasudi


why? why only to me???? lol"
[V],prashant22,2010-11-01T17:28Z,"@mzk
buddy i dont hv answers to ur questions..may be u should search google...

all i can say for ur 4th question is yes,bluray was meant to be HD(720p or 1080p)...
and for 5th ques, burn a 4gb bluray rip to a dvd,ur dvd in HD is ready.."
[V],prashant22,2010-11-01T17:59Z,"@smasudi
the way i see, it will go as downloaders looking for quality even if they hv to download 50mb extra...its a fair deal..."
[V],neon,2010-11-01T18:04Z,great upload Goku thanks
[V],prashant22,2010-11-01T18:26Z,"@neonrainbow
It's feels like its been so long that I read ur comment...good to see u busy man.."
,prank0007,2010-11-01T19:13Z,"@mzk   ans.3
bluray tech. is now available.latest movies r easily available with the set release date.As they already shot in HD and converted to bluray disc
before bluray never existed.....
so thats why old movies are released in bluray later after applying many settings to change that version to HD(720p or 1080p)
also Titanic is not available in bluray till now....:)

hope u hav got some:)"
,DSIN,2010-11-01T20:27Z,"@prank : I have HDrip of titanic... secretmyth uploaded it a couple of years ago..
& its from 1080p source :D"
,DSIN,2010-11-01T20:32Z,but u r right... it wasn't officially released... :D
,prank0007,2010-11-02T04:16Z,"@DSIN
