Release notes:

'Rock Dust Light Star' is the seventh album from British jazz funk pioneers
Jamiroquai. Fronted by the charismatic Jay Kay, this is the band's first album
in five years, following 'Dynamite' with the kind of catchiness that made
Jamiroquai a household name. Recorded between Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, and
Thailand, 'Rock Dust Light Star' features the single 'Blue Skies', a Take
That-esque uplifting pop song - a departure from tracks such as 'Space Cowboy'.
This record shows the group's talent remains as strong in 2010 as it was in
1994.

Enjoy!
