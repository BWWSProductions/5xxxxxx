,squeek2433,2011-04-03T21:53Z,"I was having the same problem as lordvahid.  White screen, 8 bit looking, can't really do anything.  It didn't work.  I followed your instructions to the letter.  I guess I should know better than to trust torrents from people who write like this -LeAkEd NoN oFfIcIaL-. 

Solution?  I used a newer version.

,victor.brazil.qwerty,2011-05-13T21:06Z,"When upgrading will it keep my previous installed apps? if so, did u guys had any probleams with compatibility?"
,_wolfie_,2011-08-10T04:25Z,"Thanks for the upload! Just a few questions:

 Does installing a new OS remove any locks placed by the service provider? Like, will I be able to use the apps that my provider locked, or change to another provider? Will I have any issues with using it in other countries etc?"
,VivaLaGaga,2011-10-18T04:38Z,"oh come on guys REPLY TO THIS PLEASE! Does this work on Blackberry 9000? I need to know OR can someone at least upload a v6 for Blackberry 9000??

,77BiOhAzArD77,2011-12-19T22:04Z,"@squeek2433 sorry it didnt work for.What the way i write has to do with a torrent eludes me and you couldnt have followed my instructions to the letter as i didnt post any,a fellow downloader did(to which im grateful princeossy) but never mind,seems to be a lot of positive remarks and a good few seeders so i guess the torrent cant be to bad.
