Synopsis
A self-titled sketch show from the Perrier-nominated comedian. This hilarious series is a menagerie of instantly recognisable characters, from the Hollywood actress with an over-enthusiastic penchant for botox to the screaming housewife who hollers every time her toast jumps from the toaster. Characters from everyday life are parodied to the extreme as the talented actress morphs through ages, accents and wigs. The critics are hailing Tate as the most exciting female comic performer around.
