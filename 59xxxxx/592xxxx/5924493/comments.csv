Install notes:

This is stupid. 

A) Why would you package it like that? It's a gargantuan pain in the arse to how to manually unpack 27 rars. 

B) There IS no setup.bat. I just looked through all 27 rar files and it is not in there. "
,Vire70,2010-11-11T04:30Z,"Okay, I take back my previous comment. It works, you just need to extract the contents of all 27 rars into a new folder, then open the vace001 (which will now look like an archive if all the other files are in the same folder) and the setup.bat is in there. 

Still, a poor packaging method and bad install notes. "
