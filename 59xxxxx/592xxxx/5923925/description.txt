The incredible true story of how an orphaned Jamaican baby,
adopted by an elderly white couple and brought up in an all
white area of London,became one of the most feared and respected
men in Britain.CASS grew up in a time before political
correctness and was forced to endure racist bullying on a daily
basis, until one day when the years of pent up anger came out in
a violent burst. CASS found through violence the respect he never
had and became addicted to the buzz of fighting. His way of life
finally caught up with him when an attempted assassination on his
life,saw him shot three times at point blank range. His inner
strength somehow managed to keep him alive but he was left with
a dilemma; whether to seek vengeance as the street had taught him
or renounce his violent past. This is the extraordinary story of
his life.

and her husband Steve. He is quickly introduced to Steve's chirpy
cock-sure younger brother Pete. Initially, Pete is reluctant to
get acquainted with Matt and allow him to tread around the
capital city with him because he may be seen by others as an

mates he quickly changes his opinion of him. On the way back from

The Firm, acclaimed British television director Alan Clarke's
last feature film, deals with the football hooliganism that was
such a serious problem in England during the 1980s. Gary Oldman
stars as Bex, a real estate agent whose true passion is being the
"top boy" of the Inter-City Crew, or ICC, from West Ham (based on
the real-life Inter-City Firm). As the film opens, Bex is engaged
in a football match while his car is being vandalized by rivals
from Birmingham,led by Yeti.His mates urge Bex to seek violent
revenge immediately, but he has other plans. Bex calls a meeting
with the two other major "firms" in England and proposes that
they band together for a trip to Germany to face off against
Dutch hooligans at the European Cup. But his rivals balk because
Bex insists on leading the new national firm. It's decided that
whichever firm comes out on top in a round robin series of battles will lead them
all to Germany.But Yeti continues to target Bex and his crew, and as the
violence escalates,there's growing dissension in the ranks.
Further complicating matters, Bex's wife, Sue,takes a dim view of his
violent "hobby,"and their relationship takes another hit when
their toddler son gets hold of Bex's beloved Stanley knife.

Set in the 1980s, Dom is a teenager who finds himself drawn into
the charismatic world of football casuals,influenced by the
firm's top boy, Bex.Accepted by the gang for his fast mouth and sense of humor,

Dom soon becomes one the boys. But as Bex and his gang clash
with rival firms across the country and the violence spirals out
of control, Dom realizes he wants out - until he learns it's not
that easy to simply walk away.Alan Clarke's 1989 movie about
British soccer hooligans is ported to the early '80s in this
loose remake. Written and directed by Nick Love, who made the
similarly themed The Football Factory, The Firm's
greatest departure from the original is following Dom,a
relatively minor character in the original,rather than Bex
(originally played by Gary Oldman).

football supporters made up of professionals dedicated to the orchestration
of organised hooliganism and violence. The documentary went on to inspire
Alan Clarke's 'The Firm'.Documentary which examines the motivation behind the
organisation of football violence by groups such as West Ham's "Inter-City Firm",
who often travel by first class ticket. It questions the members of the ICF
about their motives and attitudes. It gives the views of Leicester University
sociologists who have for five years studied the social roots of football
spectator violence. It offers evidence to judge the degree to which the
politicians, the sociologists, the Popplewell report and public opinion have got
it right.
