,Chr1ll337,2010-11-01T12:36Z,Is it safe to play just the campaign now and play online on November 9?
,spillfreak,2010-11-01T12:49Z,"Chr1ll337: Its never safe to play online before release date. This is a SSv1 release which means that microsoft can easily bust you for pirating this game. Its safer to play after the release date, but you could still get busted"
,SniperboyNL,2010-11-01T16:22Z,Is it working? Is it true there is a security in this game wich will turn my modded 360 into a non-working xbox??
,chelesv,2010-11-01T16:39Z,i want to khow is region free?
,Samuel Light,2010-11-01T17:12Z,maybe a link to pc version?
,SniperboyNL,2010-11-01T17:14Z,"@chelesv,

,bezzlebub666,2010-11-01T19:09Z,im sorry but where is the image file 
,Chr1ll337,2010-11-01T19:35Z,"If I make an Offline account and play campaign on that account, can my real (online) account get banned then?"
,jj423,2010-11-01T23:48Z,"lt+ is for the xbox 360 slims only, its being made to overcome the real-time checks with that system.... im on regular lt with the fat system and did the update just fine and have been playing online for hours now and im not banned... so maybe before you write shit, you should have correct info?? hmm??"
,millerlite2006,2010-11-02T04:11Z,"You'll get banned for playing this online early (Leaked Copy), trust me, those who say otherwise wait a week for the ban.

Wish i had my offline modded console working."
,AsssKisser666,2010-11-02T23:37Z,"This FW version is corrupt, thats why its crashing for some people. The video partiton is corrupted, the T.P version seems to be working, I just havent found it yet?!"
,AsssKisser666,2010-11-03T02:45Z,"T.P version is the one that is 6.61Gb big, and FW is 6.63gb. And the T.P version has COB in the end of the rar files. For an example: xb360cbo.part69, for those who are not so informed."

,Haluwasa,2010-11-03T16:25Z,Is it Region Free?? i have a banned xbox so does that mean there is no risk right?
