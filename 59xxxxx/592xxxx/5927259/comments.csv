,skadragon,2010-12-14T06:33Z,Someone please up a Just Dance 2 NTSC!
,golhol2,2011-01-04T20:10Z,hmm it shows the screen on the start (from the wii menu) but when you press START it goes black screen and nothing happends...  is the torrent corrupt or you have to do something special to make it work?
,badisthebest,2011-01-08T04:24Z,This is a bad torrent. After the download you open the rar file and it asks for a password to open it. Dont download!

,thebestgirl7,2011-02-17T06:22Z,Works perfectly for me. Is it normal I can't download new songs? Such as Fireworks from Katy Perry...it always says no content to download...
,upstreamftw,2011-02-17T22:13Z,"WBFS manager is saying its PAL ffs, better not be I spent 2 days of my seedbox on power seeding the shit outta this to share it seeded it 50 times."
,iSushay,2011-02-28T13:20Z,Why can't i download katy perry-firework?
,warioworld,2011-03-04T06:50Z,Works perfect. But I think its PAL. I used WBFS manager 3.0 and I put the game in my hdd. Then I used neogamma and forced NTSC and it worked with full colors. This is also Just Dance 2. I don't know what some of your are talking about but this game works just fine. Thanks a million WEBCHELLA!!!!!!!!!! Youre the Man!!!!! I'm also a NOOB. SO if i can do it so can YOU!!
