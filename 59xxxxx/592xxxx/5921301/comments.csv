the 'unpacking' of the provided rar-files (exactly what the point in compressing/splitting any file offered for download, especially the splitting part, is just fucking beyond me, short of attempting to HIDE SOMETHING) reveals the contents are in fact a .wmv file (video codec wmv9), not an .avi file, which it would've had to've been for it to be encoded with Xvid (see torrents title)

asshole ....

more importantly, your fucking piece of shit file, which ultimately consumed my precious bandwidth, is DRM PROTECTED !!

what, you fucking numbskull, is the point in that ?

please tell me !!"
