Jamie Oliver 30 mins Meals by Phil @ EOF

Especially for asighkick

Following feedback there are changes to lower the resolution to 630 by 354 and bitrate lowered also hence a lower file size. 

Quality is still not that good but hopefully acceptable for you Jamie fans out there at last prior to the DVD coming out.

Enjoy!
