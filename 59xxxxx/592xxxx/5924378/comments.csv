As said before, the video is perfectly acceptable although you are at an immediate disadvantage having to convert from tape to an editable format and then convert to .avi 

I think that the 'experts' out there either record directly into the computer using a TV card or save to a DVD Recorder first.

One private site I belong to offers an encoding guide and he recommends VideoReDo Plus (you can find copies on Demonoid) the FREE Gordian Knot (GK) and a XviD codec from www.koepi.org/xvid.shtml

Hope that helps"
