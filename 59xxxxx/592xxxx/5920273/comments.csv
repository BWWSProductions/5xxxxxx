,beckiibubbles90,2011-09-30T18:12Z,MKV :/ needed AVI
,99jay88,2011-10-14T21:52Z,"MKV is a popular format for torrent uploads.  It kinda sucks, but it is what it is.  It is a great format for preserving quality, but it is lousy for playback on ""media devices"" other than PCs. There is a great program that is FREE callled Xmedia Recode.  I use it to convert all my vids to mp4 files to watch on my Xbox 360 and for my kids to watch on their iPod touches via our network hard drive.  If you use Xmedia Recode to convert for Xbox 360 make sure to use the pre-configured setting for Playstation 3 (no joke).  It has a setting for Xbox 360, but it is hit or miss of the files will actually play back on the 360."

Always use VLC Media Player to play test video, and if it doesnt work in there its facked.

Just try playing with the setting in Convertx youll be suprised.

And use Peerblock people dont get hit ;)"
