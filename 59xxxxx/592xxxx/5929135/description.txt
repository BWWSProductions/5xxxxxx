"Almost Famous"

Responding to an "Officer Down" emergency call, 
Castle and Beckett's latest case takes a 
shocking turn when it's revealed that the 
victim isn't a cop but a male stripper dressed 
up as one. The murder leads them into the world 
of male strip clubs, the hardships of 
struggling actors, and the price that people 
pay in pursuit of fame. Did our victim's dreams 
of stardom get him killed, or was there 
something more nefarious afoot?

Ah, that little rat is such a lil cutie ;) 

Enjoy :)
