TV Show: Bones 
http://www.tv.com/bones/show/33332/summary.html?tag=page_nav;main

These are HQ DVD Rips of Bones with extended versions labeled so YOU have the choice on which to pick for download. I included all special features. Some episodes have commentary which will be the second track.

*Note* All commentary / special features use AC3 2 channel audio only because that was the only available source, but all episodes use AC3 6-channel.

Each episode is 550mb except for the (Extended) & (commentary) episodes running 625mb.

Subtitles:
Just extract the language you want to the Season 5 folder and it should automatically play the subtitles for that season\\\'s episodes. Note: I spent about 4 days correcting errors in the subtitles, but I imagine there still may be SOME mistakes. I tried to correct everything I could find but I\\\'m only human :P
