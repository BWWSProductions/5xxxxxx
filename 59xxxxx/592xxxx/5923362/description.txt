Plot summary

A race of alien parasites that has discovered the secret of transforming human
flesh into biomechanical weaponry stages a grotesque invasion of planet Earth,
only to discover just how mighty the power of love truly is in directors Yudai
Yamaguchi and Junichi Yamamoto's unhinged, experimental sci-fi horror hybrid.
They possess the ability to transform their hosts into mechanical death dealers
who will stop at nothing to see their enemies torn to pieces, and now it appears
that mankind is facing certain annihilation. When a pair of young romantics begins
to find their bodies riddled with oozing, tumorous globules, the heart is pitted
against the mind as the couple's killer instincts gradually begin to overpower their
undying love. In the tradition of Shinya Tsukamoto's Tetsuo: The Iron Man, Meatball
Machine takes viewers into a horrific and darkly comic world where the flesh turns on
the body to horrific effect.
