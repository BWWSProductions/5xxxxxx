* New features : *

On the 11 August 2010, Sports Interactive published a YouTube video announcing a number of new features that will be included in Football Manager 2011. 

This video announced the following features:
 Agents roles have been enhanced; there will be five types of agents that negotiate contracts. Some will give you a blank page for negotiations, while others 

will ask for too much and others will be more sensible.
 There will be around a dozen new contact clauses, including a bonus for players making it into the Team of the Year and a minimum fee release clause if a big 

club comes in.
 Negotiations with a player have been made "face to face" in order to increase the realism of the game.
 Training has been enhanced; there will be fourteen extra areas to train players in, and a new match preparation section allows you to train players in specific 

formations.
 Interaction with players and other managers has been improved, including making it possible to have private conversations with players.
 There are new board requests as part of this improved interaction, including requesting higher percentage of transfer revenue and requesting a new stadium if 

the current stadium can't be expanded.
 The news section and inbox have been merged back together with a new look, and there are more options for subscriptions.
 The match engine has been improved to include player emotion, meaning players will react more visibly to what is happening on the pitch.
 The much-requested "dynamic league reputation" has been included, meaning that if game-players take on a club in a less fancied nation, and take that club to 

glory, the reputation of that nation's league will raise.
