Hey globe I have a question. I haven't finished downloading it yet but since it's a repack. I doesn't get in the Windows registry like a normal install would so so do you think you could post those registry keys please?

,Qoelet,2010-11-02T10:09Z,"THIS DOES NOT WORK.

1. I extract the .arc file and it is EMPTY
2. Mounting the .iso does NOTHING and only shows me an icon.
3. The only files in the torrent are the above empty .arc and .iso and two .ico images and a .jpg

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME DOWNLOADING THIS.

I should have guessed with it only being 750mb when all the others are twice as big.

The instructions text is useless. The .arc file is empty and mounting the .iso only shows you an icon, it's crap."
