,k3nd00d,2010-12-15T14:50Z,"Hey DarthExile...I have an old white XBOX 360 and a new XBOX 360 S and the XviDs I put up have been tested on them and play just fine on them! Stop lying. If you aren't lying, you may just be dumb. Are you using media center to stream it to a 360 from a PC? This typically won't work for any XviD/DivX. Just don't use the media center method. I can stream to either of my 360s from the Videos section, but not that crappy media center...or on CD-R or DVD-R or USB drive."

1 - be polite to uploaders
2- why do you assume this is the uppers fault?
3 -0 an xbox is a games system,a simple laptop or any media facility that can download & install klite codecs pack -will suffice.
4- look at comments-seed & downloads,why arent there 40 odd posts complaining? BECAUSE THE FILE IS FINE-IT WORKS FINE.
you owe the uplaoder an apology
file downloaded & tested-working!"
