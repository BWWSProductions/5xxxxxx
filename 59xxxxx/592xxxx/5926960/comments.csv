what's your config ?
delete all files, the extract the .7z, mount the .dmg (with toast for me), copy the game where you want, and start the game.

if that doesn't work, delte the folder ""Audiosurf"" in: home/library/applications support, you will find here the Audiosurf folder. Delete and restart the game."
,Dobik2000,2010-11-03T13:55Z,"Hey, I can't get it to work either. I followed all the instructions, but whenever I try launching it, I get the initialization screen, but then it just quits. I'm guessing there's a problem with the initialization, but I have no idea what kind of problem...
Any ideas?"
,corruptedSoul,2010-11-06T18:06Z,"Tested on Leopard 10.5 working fine,
 will not work on Snow Leopard 10.6

This port was released in May 2009.
It is not compatible with Snow Leopard 10.6
Snow Leopard was released in August 2009.

""Y can't they updated it to support 10.6?""

People have tried, apparently wrappers that are SL 10.6 compatible are not Audiosurf compatible.

I suggest the uploader to include system requirements and restrictions for future uploads."
,Dobik2000,2010-11-08T11:35Z,"Hmmm, too bad that it doesn't work on Mac OS 10.6, I don't really want to downgrade my system... However, since my last comment, I found another similar game which happens to be free (although probably not as complete as this one): http://www.musicracer.de/
Hope this helps to ease the frustration."
,KawMoc,2010-11-21T16:43Z,"@all 10.6 users: here the thread at portingteam.com to have the game for you !

Enjoy!"
