,keith23uk,2010-10-31T00:57Z,"Just can see the first piece of avi atm though. Didnt hear what language and camera moves to get set up I think. Last shot I see is a crowd with 3D silhouette, aka ghosting 3D effect on them. (Main reason why they want you to go see it to make their money ofc 3D ruining movies and costing you more to see!) The audio from the little I heard seems very decent. Cant tell you anymore atm though."
,therebelrider,2010-10-31T01:37Z,the  cam print suks 2 d core...not at all watchable..
,dakneeul,2010-10-31T01:54Z,visual seems blurred. havent heard audio yet need codec. 
,Puma__84,2010-10-31T01:58Z,hope it's not fake
,keith23uk,2010-10-31T02:18Z,From the first 50 secs of video: Well can now confirm the audio is spoken in english! Can clearly tell what they are saying. Yes the camera is not the best quality but this is a first release. Has some blur to it also but thats also due to being in a 3D cinema showing. Pastyness to it. If you want to watch this in a good quality video I suggest you wait. A7.5 V4

,JoeBianco,2010-10-31T03:01Z,Someone please seed! I'm stuck at 36%!
,Puma__84,2010-10-31T04:00Z,it's bad quality of the movie have seen from the beginning and it is slow to download.
,pauze_2193,2010-10-31T04:17Z,seed pls
,bigshow9774,2010-10-31T06:53Z,3d is suppsed to be a way to stop piracy what a joke not stopping it but will take a while longer to get the movie or untill someone in another country get the movie thats not 3d all countrys doesnt do this just here because industry sucks
,MaxMouseG,2010-10-31T10:34Z, I agree with ogudaktig nobody asked for this 3D shit. All these damn movies all of a sudden coming out in 3D when 3D movies been around for years... and got old...
