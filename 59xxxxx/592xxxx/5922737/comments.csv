[V],globeplus,2010-10-31T12:25Z,"EXTRA NOTE :  beside the acceptable quality in picture and sound , dvd original bonds in case of have it , can be addicionated to the interface menu in the next way : normal conversion from the dvd copy to wmv then the exact same name that is inside the Bonds folder for the current worked converted movie to the wmv converted file , then remove the current converted movie inside the Bonds folder and substitute from the dvd copy converted with the same name that was before and the interface will read the new one with normality , the only thing is that the conversion with more or less bitrate must be wmv , thatĂÂ´s all . 
I repeat the included wmvs are acceptable to watch but original DVD copys converted to wmv can be used too , with the file interface menu ."

EXCUSE ME? Sympathic???"
,RC_Ebooks,2010-11-06T09:27Z,What's GOOD about this torrent when I need to get the entire thing to watch anything due to you putting in a .RAR archive? FUCK THIS!
