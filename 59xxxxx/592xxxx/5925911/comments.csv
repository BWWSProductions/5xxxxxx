,nameuser123,2010-11-01T14:48Z,"""Mary's Prayer - Danny Wilson""

Not a one hit wonder. Based on the UK  Top 40 chart, Danny Wilson had a second top 40 hit:

The Second Summer Of Love in Jun 1989. Got to number 23.

Deee-Lite also had another hit. ThePower Of Love / Deee-Lite Theme - which got to number 25."
,nameuser123,2010-11-01T14:57Z,"The Cutting Crew were not one hit wonders neither. 

Cutting Crew's 'I've Been In Love Before' (great song too) got to number 31. Their only other hit. 

I am referring to the UK Top 40 chart, not the US Billboard chart."

[V],neon,2010-11-01T18:09Z,And yes that EMI info is real....i checked :)
,nameuser123,2010-11-02T02:56Z,"Perhaps EMI should look at the following website before releasing any future 'Best One Hit Wonders' cds?

http://www.everyhit.com/searchsec.php

If you type Danny Wilson in the artist search box it will show you they had two hits. Same is true for Cutting Crew.

I'm no music mastermind but if I can find out the correct information, surely EMI can! (rolling my eyes)
