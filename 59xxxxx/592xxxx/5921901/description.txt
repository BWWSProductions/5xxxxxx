F/X man Rollie Tyler is now a toymaker. Mike, the ex-husband of his girlfriend, Kim is a cop. He asks Rollie to help him catch a killer. And the operation was going well when some unknown man kills both the killer and Mike. Mike's boss, Silak says it was the killer who killed Mike but Rollie knows it wasn't. Obviously Silak is involved with Mike's death, so he calls on Leo McCarthy, the cop from the last movie, who is now a P.I. for help. And they discover it's not just Silak whom they have to worry about.
