Release notes:

James Blunt releases his third studio album Some Kind Of Trouble.

The album features 12 new songs and was produced by Steve Robson (with
additional production from Greg Kurstin and Eg White). It sees Blunt, who has
sold in excess of 16 million albums worldwide, capturing a new feeling of
spontaneity and freshness summed up by his comment that he sees his first two
albums as a pair of book ends - action and reaction.

Some Kind Of Trouble, then, is very much the start of a new chapter. The album
was recorded largely in London with members of James' touring band.

The album includes the single "Stay The Night".

p.s. Have excluded an empty track of 5 seconds that should've been between track
11 and 12.

Enjoy!
