Ideal application for those who want to make your own icons without having to be a graphic designer, so you can create any shape, add your own pictures, make small compositions, and even import any of the icons are already included in the program modify freely.
You can create icons from scratch by a handy drawing kit, get icons from images captured or areas on your screen, import or export icons, and of course apply a wide range of filters and graphic effects. Icon Workshop works with most popular formats and recognize all graphics standards, including PSD, PNG, BMP, JPG, GIF, etc..
It also has support for icons with transparency, thanks to its soft edges and shadow effects are much nicer.
Besides its main functions of design and editing, the program includes utilities to customize the system icons, manage your own library (with possibility to extract icons) and more."
