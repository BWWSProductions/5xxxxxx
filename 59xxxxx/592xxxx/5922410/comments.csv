I just need to change wbfs into iso in the map or what?"
,BlackDaliah,2011-08-03T07:21Z,Do you have a External HDD formatted into a FAT or wbfs? if you have it formatted in FAT then you need to create a WBFS folder in the root of your HDD then just copy and paste it into the folder. also you need to soft mod your wii if you havnt done so already. But for this file im not sure yet.
