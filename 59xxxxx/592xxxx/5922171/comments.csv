[T],whodathoughtit,2010-11-02T23:04Z,"@rogamosh 
what is your problem you fool

the reason I would like to know is it also says snow panther which I believe is something to do with Mac

so I would like to know why it says snow panther and thats not in the description, who's the idiot    "
[T],whodathoughtit,2010-11-03T13:47Z,"so what I can gather this is windows 7 with different software integration and it has nothing to do with the Mac, I guess someone thought they should include tools that they find useful
