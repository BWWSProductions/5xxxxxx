,hz66,2011-01-06T01:15Z,"When I mount the iso and proceed with install I come to the cd key screen. After I type the key in the ""Next"" button is still faded grey. 

Any suggestions? "

,rob66699,2011-04-09T17:31Z,"@ nicqawsed just double click the first archive, make sure you have winRAR, when it extracts, it builds the file from all parts on its own"
,Dededeath,2011-04-16T00:37Z,How do you find the version of this game because I got the expansion from a torrent and to play it says needs to update. When I try to use the update button it just closes on me. Help me!
,Ferdyfist,2011-04-18T21:12Z,THIS WORKS GREAT ! Even on windows 7 64bit! Thanks!
,effepirat,2011-04-27T19:59Z,"to make this game the best, get the IT expansion and the UNDERLORD mod:

there is no ARPG experience better than that available right now."
,KineticTowel,2011-05-05T12:13Z,"So yeah, I have the same thing, tons of rars, but I'll try the tip given to Nicqawsed. Let's hope it works! It seems like an incredibly fun game! I've been longing for a nice mythological RPG. Also if you like pirate games I strongly recommend Age of Pirates 2! It's amazing. Thank you RELOADED."
,PonyJL,2011-05-11T14:39Z,"Game, key and crack are working perfect.
Thanks for the game, will upload!

,Bonjih,2011-07-23T00:43Z,Doesn't work by me it crashes when I come out of my first cave.
,sceltonn,2011-08-08T22:10Z,"to fix the virtual memory issue

Go to Documents (Vista) or My Documents (XP) then My Games > Titan Quest > Settings.

 Open the file named 'options' then add the line ""skipCompatibilityChecks = true"" at the bottom (without the """" of course).

 This stops the game from checking if Virtual Memory is enabled.

 I'm pretty sure you're allowed to do this, it's insane that the game should force you to change your computer's settings.

but it still doesnt change the fact that when i proceed after the first cave in the game it freezes and an error message appears saying the game has stopped working"
,koopatroopa_15,2011-08-09T19:48Z,"This is a GREAT game that I have really gotten into. Somehow it flew under my radar until now. 

Just one thing though. If you plan to just play single player you should: 

Install the game using one of the serials in the .txt file

Google Titan Quest Update

Run the update program

Do not use the crack that is included ( if you replace the original .exe with the crack you will not be able to use the updater program )

The updater is almost a must have. The game crashed for me several times until I got about 12 hours in at which time it became unplayable. The updates also add a lot of balance to the game.

THANK YOU UL AND SEEDERS this is a fantastic game !"
,FatHooker,2011-09-05T07:22Z,"***Broken Game*** 
As a computer technician for Canada Computersâ„¢, I have deemed this entire torrent as a 'waste of time' / 'pointless' download. The game inevitably crashes and you can no longer play it as you will not be able to re-load your current save file. The only work-around for that is to literally uninstall the game and then re-install it. Tried and tested on two high end gaming computer's, one being a top Alienware PC. 

I've also tried installing every single patch available (not possible); with a cracked game. Tried updating the game right after a clean installation with success but then only to get a huge error when then trying to open/crack the game. Tried to tweak some generic settings, run as administrator, disabled SFK within the game, changed compatibility, disabled hardware acceleration, read through many forums, tweaked settings, enabled emulators via mounting device, etc. You name it, I did it. 

As this is a huge post now... Ultimately, I wouldn't bother downloading this at all. Version 1.01 is garbage and you won't get much play time out of it until it crashes. Lastly I'll be attempting to install the expansion and see if maybe with that I'll be able to update it and use that as a work-around. If I discover a successful way to get this game working, I'll be sure to list the correct steps I took to do so. 

(Not a flame/troll, just a friendly warning)"
,FatHooker,2011-09-05T22:55Z,"*Update* 
I've discovered a flawless way to actually get this game working perfectly for LAN and Single-Player. It's actually quite simple and very easy to do. Just a matter of endless trial-and-error until the functional way was discovered.
-Download Titan.Quest-RELOADED
-Extract folders to form the ISO
-Mount the ISO (Daemon Tools is great)
-Install the game
-Do NOT change or alter any files
-Get the update for 1.01 to 1.30, easily found
(http://www.fileplanet.com/165204/160000/fileinfo/Titan-Quest-Patch-v1.01---v1.30)
-Install update; very simple

Now you can play the game and somehow don't even have to worry about any crack. Just use the icon on your desktop and away you go, no crashes, LAN working, and along with single-player. Easy! "
,stealthreaper,2011-09-24T11:47Z,fathooker is right...tried and worked 100% no crashes so update and no crack necessary for single player and LAN (gameranger is simplest for lan play if using WIFI and don't feel like changin up ports)
