A selection of tracks that is entirely consistent with what you'd expect from the Nonesuch label, all rather restrained and tasteful ... high-brow in other words. But like many compilations, it lacks any coherence or real focal point. Still, perfectly fine as far as it goes - worthwhile listening, as an introduction / overview of the various artists represented.
