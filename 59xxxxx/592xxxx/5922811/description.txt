This the version of "Once in a Lifetime" that the TH did for the opener of "Down and Out in Beverly Hills." It isn't as long as the album version, but it is different enough to me to be worth while. The synthesizer-only intro is nearly 30 seconds long and you can hear Nick Nolte's dog Kerouac barking just before David Byrne begins singing.

Hope you enjoy it!
