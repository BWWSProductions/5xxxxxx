Ok, I know it's in French BUT:

-- if you have done volume one, you know there is an exemple of the task at the beginning of every exercice. 

-- I took the pain to compil you a lexicon of the words used in task description. Size: one page. 

-- I also translated all the reading comprehension questions. 


So   E.N.G.L.I.S.H.   S.P.E.A.K.E.R.,  this torrent   I.S.   also for   Y.O.U.


Thanks everyone for seeding as long as you can.
