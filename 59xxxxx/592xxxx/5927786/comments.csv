,GryphonB,2010-12-07T12:17Z,"Christ was not a Jew? I love you guys! Please, whatever you're doing, don't stop. But I am pretty sure he was 'cut'. Maybe it means in a metaporical sense? Small nose? Saves, but doesn't invest at 5%? Never once told a joke about 2 men coming out of a bar? Never studied acountancy?"
,Torent.Spy,2010-12-23T02:54Z,Christ was  and He is Son of God. Each of us will face Him one day and will answer to Him what we did while we were on earth....
