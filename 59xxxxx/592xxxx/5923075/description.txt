   Power Snooker is an innovative re-working of the traditional game  
    In Power Snooker points count, frames dont  the player scoring    
    the most points in half an hour wins.                               
                                                                        
     The Power Snooker table is of traditional size but with a modern     
     design and a bespoke Power Snooker baize.                            
                                                                          
     Each game of Power Snooker will last half an hour, with the clock    
     starting as the reds are broken and stopping as the final black      
     of each frame drops.                                                 
                                                                          
     A PowerZone delivers double points and when the PowerBall is         
     potted, it triggers a two minute PowerPlay during which every      
     ball potted counts double. The game is presented in an energetic,    
     contemporary style, which will deliver excitement, tension and       
     spectacle.
