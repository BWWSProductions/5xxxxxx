,snake89453,2010-11-04T10:56Z,This game is pretty much unplayable unless you understand the language or get lucky and choose the right option.
,furbos,2010-11-06T07:57Z,Don't install stupid japanese language packs or these games. Language packs will mess with your computer and these games are stupid.
,chaotic82,2010-11-09T03:41Z,"I have searched every where, used appLocale, changed all my setttings too.  I tried to just run the msi but no luck it tells me wrong OS or OS version.  I have no idea what to do.  I have a xp system.  I am stuck, even after going to the link tufla posted."

The HF patch. (for people unable to google) Will solve some problems plus add more content to the game"
,MultiBethesda,2011-02-01T02:48Z,"For the people who do not have plans giving this game a pre hour to installed should wait until a new torrets arrive with an english version. Maybe it will never comes, depends on how the game develops.

The problems with this game is that its runed with the japanese laugauge codes. Well, that means that Windows (english) codes do not fit properly and well ( do not understand what to do with this game) because it cant understand japanese, sort of...

And yes it is possible to get this running but hard if you do not know much about computers. Im sorry kidos but w8 until later ;)"

,nightbreed32,2011-07-16T01:12Z,should mention that the language problem is there and that is in installable and that you have to know how to read jap .... fail
,Baztardo,2011-07-23T03:00Z,"Its not instable. The only thing not working with english subs after you patch it, is the option chat (with the girls). It isnt much of a loss since everything else is in english and the chatsequence is just some lines to get to know the girls.. Runs like a dream on W7 64b"
,casualpirate,2011-08-27T01:18Z,"This works on Windows 7

There is an instructional video for the installation on a famous internet video hosting site which I can't link here. Search for it.

To instantly install applocale with rightclick shortcuts search Hongfire for ""HF pAppLoc""

Now all you need to do is

download game

install applocale with above link (takes 2 seconds)

mount image

rightclick setup -> run in japanese as admin

install game in C/Illusion/Sexy Beach Zero (make sure installation folder is in english letters and NOT in program files or on another drive

during installation mount second image when prompted

download english translation patch (Google it)

run patch

start game

enjoy"
