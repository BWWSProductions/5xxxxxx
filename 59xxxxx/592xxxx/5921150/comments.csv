[T],trialNerror,2010-11-21T06:26Z,"Episode 4 is now available.
The series was on hold after the Lizzie Borden episode.  Unknown reasons as to why, but the show may not make a full 2nd season.  It is now currently aired at 2AM Saturdays.  The kiss of death time slot.
Personally, I think too many people got pissed off at how they tried to get a confession out of Lizzie and also at how they were yelling at the little girl Mary.  Discovery channel probably received a pile of complaint mail and now we will get to watch reruns of Dirty Jobs and Swamp Loggers instead.  Joy. =|"
