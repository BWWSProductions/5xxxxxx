Thanks a lot, there are some hard-to-find movies here. :)"

[T],Jonzee,2011-03-07T13:21Z,"Downloaded ""Machine Gun Kelly"" a very nice DVDRIP of a rare Bronson film, with Eng audio, and optional Dutch subs, ""Breakout"" is another great rip along with ""Someone Behind the Door"". I have had to be patient but the films are downloading OK, getting them 3-4 at a time. Thanks for the super torrent NLUPPER002."

,guduknecmi,2011-12-06T01:18Z,"I hate to rain on your parade, but this 200 gb torrent could be a waste. Why?

So far I downloaded the first 7 or 8 movies, and all of them are DVDs made from divx movies, not the original DVDs.

So there are no menus, extras or multiple aoudio options, but that's not the main issue. The main issue is, when you make a DVD from a divx, the result is often not good. There's quite a quality loss. In fact, you'd have a much clearer picture on the actual divx than on a DVD made from that divx. 

It's like making a nice 800 x 600 picture and enlarging it to 2000 x 3000. Sure, the new one is bigger, but you see pixels the size of my foot. Not a good idea.

In Miss Sadie Thompson and Apache, you can't even recognize who's who. The quality is that bad.

Before you start calling me an ungrateful bastard: I'm a big Bronson fan and I appreciate the time it takes for a 200+ gb upload, but only when the result is worth it. Just download one movie, burn it and see for yourself."
