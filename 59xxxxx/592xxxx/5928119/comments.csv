[V],AlbaGuBrath,2010-11-03T19:32Z,"@ ethertaster the .001 file is just a compressed file, use WinRar to extract it, or google how to extract it!! This is the genuine crack!! .BONE is one of the best uploaders on here!! if you are too lazy to extract it, click on my username and d/l it from there!! "

,Gilb.,2010-11-17T14:36Z,This doesn't work. There is no .ISO-file and the 001-file can't be extracted!!!
