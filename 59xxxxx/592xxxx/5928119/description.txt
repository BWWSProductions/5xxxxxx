Game Information:

Football Manager 2011 will be more polished than ever this year, and Sports
Interactive will again set a new standard for the genre by adding a host of
new features. For the first time ever, aspiring managers can now negotiate
contracts with players in real time. And by working with a multitude of
real-life football agents, Sports Interactive gained an insight as to how
these negotiations can be made as realistic as possible in-game. Prepare
to meet different types of agents in your contract talks; each with their
own personality so will therefore need a different approach.
