,pirateyargh,2010-11-03T04:27Z,Aspect ratio looks messed up.  The people look too narrow from L-R.

,truthy,2010-11-04T20:09Z,"thx for sharing,

quality is watchable - but the source can't be a dvd2 release

aspect ratio 16/9 is wrong - it should be 2.35:1
you can change it easily during playback with vlc/mpc hc or permanently with yamb (if you know how to calculate a the new PAR) or by extracting the video/audio streams from the mp4 with yamb and then muxing them into mkv with mkvmerge setting the AR there."
