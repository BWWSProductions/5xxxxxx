,acenoise,2011-02-16T23:42Z,I really enjoyed the film thank you so much for the up you are a kind person :)
,acenoise,2011-02-16T23:44Z,"V=9 (Not HD, so very blocky on large tv!)
A=10"
,vivatpb5776,2011-04-09T07:28Z,Full screen version. Video quality is average at best. Audio quality is low and distorted.
,mige36369,2011-04-27T04:13Z,thanks
,foxseven,2011-07-08T06:24Z,"To sum it all up the quality is okay, and is worth downloading."
,brownkity,2011-07-23T16:12Z,"@ tjanator: At least you can disable the subtitles... I realized that AFTER I watched the movie the whole way through... Other than the horrid removable summarized subtitles, this is a great download. I wouldn't call it a bad download just because of something as trivial as that... unless you need to read the subtitles to watch the show... 
Overall, this is a great download, and worth it. If it wasn't, it wouldn't have (@ time of posting) 47 seeders, and only 5 leechers... Thanks for the upload!!!"
,Revolos55,2011-09-20T10:41Z,"I found the A/V quality fine, and the wildly inaccurate subtitles can be turned off. Thanks for the upload. Had a yen to watch this for a while now."
,tunnelsunshine,2012-03-15T22:08Z,"over all is ok. audio is quiet, needs to be turned up, and at louder times (during alot of laughing) it then is too loud but whatever. video is ok. thanks. a 8 v 7"

THX"
,popeye013,2012-03-25T00:52Z,"Why is it that no where has the widescreen version. They all have the same shitty version that came on the VHS tape... 
And i know a Widescreen version is outthere, because the BBC screened it a few years back, on BBC One over christmas."
,pikel69,2012-06-23T22:49Z,"For those of you unfamiliar with encoding, a .srt file is an external subtitle file.  Just don't download it or delete it and you won't have subs... simply fixed."
