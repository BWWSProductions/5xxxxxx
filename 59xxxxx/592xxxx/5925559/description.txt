NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........

Right for this we took the russian proper avi file which is the full movie and made some changes.
The file does have really bad interlace issues,which we fixed the best we could....but
the original encode is messed up so
The video itself was OK for a cam....but nothing to write home about.
Colours were off ...lots of pink,blue ....so we used a white balance and a rgb eq to fix it
the best we could.We also made it a touch sharper and brighter .
Now the audio we were sent by LKRG but needed to be synced and filtered, we also made this release with
full audio for this proper video source, as others are missing video footage from the beginning and the end.

Anyway Enjoy folks....
