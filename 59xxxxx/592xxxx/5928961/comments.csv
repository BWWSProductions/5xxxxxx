,VISailor,2010-12-01T01:19Z,"Fine piece of work; achieved what others didn't. WAT messages a thing of the past. Keep up the good work, Thumper!"
,Aquahutch,2010-12-13T23:41Z,"Unfortunately, Microsoft figured it out. An update at the first part of December has snuffed out RemoveWAT. :( Hopefully we get another removal tool soon."
,sahand123456,2010-12-23T17:16Z,guys you must off your microsoft update and then you are guranted for win7

Works perfectly.

Good job ! Thanks."
,globalpuffer,2011-02-12T13:24Z,"Your a fucking god and you know it,  Thanks man."
,maverick81a,2011-02-23T15:53Z,"This WAT remover was working fine, and I was able to do Windows updates as well, but on doing Windows 7 SP1 update, I am getting back the message of Windows not Genuine. So I would recommend do not update to SP1, if you want WAT remover 2.2.6 to keep working."
,Otaku1,2011-02-25T04:25Z,"This works after SP1.  If you have used prior to SP1 run program, restore WAT, compulsory reboot, run program, remove WAT, compulsory reboot, done!"
,rocketero,2011-02-25T17:53Z,"Can not apply this removewat after applying SP1 to wind 7 x86. Get an error just after start running and screen loose all icons and taskbar, just a black screen with that error message."
,Ianpbx,2011-03-01T02:17Z,As of Feb 2011 (Win 7 (x64) SP1 update) this version does not work. New updated version needed.
,tinkano,2011-03-26T12:43Z,Works perfectly on Win7x32pro with SP1
,hitleroo,2011-04-23T08:36Z,Worked like a charm. Many thanks.
,ndame121,2011-06-04T05:49Z,It seems to work although igot a message saying that windows could not connect to some server and my desktop background changed to a solid black color after rebooting. I cannot prove it was a result of this application but it is certainly highly coincidental that it happened after the automatic required reboot. I hope this is not a virus.
,Ojii-dono,2011-06-26T21:39Z,"I was running RemoveWAT 2.0 til this past update got me. even got thru SP1.  I downloaded RemoveWAT 2.2.6.0 and ran it. ""WAT has already been removed"".  I restored WAT. Got a virus warning from AVG (paid) ""WPAkill"" (well yeah.  hehe. Ignore) and an error message from .net framework. just press continue. the app looked like it stalled so i left it for a minute and rebooted from the task manager.  Ran RemoveWAT. Removed WAT. Rebooted. WAT gone. 

WIN7 ultimate x64 SP1 latest updates at time of removal."
,zfa9675,2011-07-09T20:40Z,I have windows 7 64 bit and windows says that i have illegal copy of windows even though i have tried cracking the os. i have used every crack but none work for me. when i use the loader it tells me to uninstall other patches under status so it doesnt let me install or uninstall. please help me!
,YK2011,2011-07-14T14:09Z,"Hey everyone, I just want to mention that some of the latest versions of RemoveWAT DO have malware in them.

This includes an (almost) unclosable keylogger.

I found a data.dat file in my Roaming folder last month and it contained every document I typed, every password entered, everything, all the way back from February. When I last used RemoveWAT. After rebooting from using RemoveWAT, you can use my tool to clean up in safe mode.

TPB.org/torrent/6539908

I can give anyone and everyone the source code, and can e-mail everyone my site which also has a DDL to the cleaner too.

Be safe everyone!"
,YK2011,2011-07-14T14:33Z,"I also forgot to mention that once properly embedded in the system, this malware will try to spread through USB devices.

In order to prevent this, you will have to enable hidden files and folders, open any USB storage devices you have used on any cracked Windows computers, and look for a hidden ""svchost.exe"" and hidden ""autorun.inf"". If you open the autorun.inf file, it will have ""run=svchost.exe"" on one of the lines. When you plug the USB drive in, the svchost.exe will copy itself to the Roaming folder of the current user and run.

This is extremely hard to detect on Windows x86 (32 bit) machines. However, if you look in the TaskManager and sort by Image Name, you will see that one of the svchost.exes is running in 32 bit mode (svchost.exe*32).

Newer variants may have 64 bit versions of this, but it can always be detected if you go to your Roaming folder (my app also has this shortcut built-in) and see an svchost.exe sitting there, you've got it."
