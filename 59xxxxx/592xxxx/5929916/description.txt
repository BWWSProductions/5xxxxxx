Yeolhan-beonjjae eomma aka My 11th Mother (2007) South Korea

A woman suddenly appears at Jae-suâ€™s house. Nothing in her hands, nowhere to go, the womanâ€™s empty eyes meet with round eyes of the eleven year-old boy. He regards the woman as another person whoâ€™ll leave and does not put any effort into getting to know her. Every chance he finds, the boy scolds the woman, saying she eats too much, sleeps like a pig and uses up all of the utilities. The two of them are neck and neck with complaints until she learns of the boyâ€™s sad history and he discovers her diabetes. The boy has already had 10 stepmothers in the past. Out of the blue the boyâ€™s father shows up and begins beating the boy. She tries to stop him and they find themselves on common ground. A warm relationship between the two begins to build up slowly, not aware of the eventual separation that is just around the corner.
