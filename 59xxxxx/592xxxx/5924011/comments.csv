,saurabhrock,2010-10-31T18:14Z,thanks a lot for your efforts
,holmeselectric9,2010-11-03T15:42Z,Is the audio out of sync on this one also??? There has got to be a way to fix that. Ive heard of one before but I forgot the instructions :(
,bullyooo,2010-11-06T21:02Z,if your using vlc player the audio is easy to work out. if its behind the video u have to fasten it up... by just clicking the letter k and to slow it down if its faster then the video just click j and do this as many times as you need to to sort the audio out
