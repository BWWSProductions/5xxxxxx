My Notes:
Ok, so i downloaded Paranormal Activity 2 TS READNFO XViD â€“

IMAGiNE.
dropped it into vdub.
i changed the brigtness & contrass.
then i sharpened a little bit.
then i used the hue/saturation/intensity filter by donald graft

(thanks, who ever u are)
after that i adjusted the clolours
then finaly i re-sized (changed the resolution).
I watched it and from, 1hr 18mins 14secs the video goes all

pixalated and distorted. (i think it could of been 1 of the

filters i used)
so i cut off everything after 1:18:14, then cut imagines from

1:18:14 to the end of the film. re-sized (changed the resolution)

& changed the bitrate of imagines and stuck them together.
i left the audio as it is as im no good with audio.

i think it looks better than imagines, but have a look 4 urself 
http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/667
its mine then when u put the mouse over it, it becomes imagines

The film itself is ok, but like the first 1 it takes a long time

to get started (as such).
I wont say anymore as i dont want to spoil the film 4 u so,
Enjoy the film, there is a sample included.

SCREENS!
