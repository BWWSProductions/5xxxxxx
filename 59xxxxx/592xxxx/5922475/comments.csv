ok for those of you think that the 4 extra premium voices of star wars don't work, you're wrong, they actually work,. pay attention, lol.

in the english voice section at the top, you will see c3po, darth vader, yoda, and han solo voice with buy button next to them, then as you scroll down to the bottom of english voice section you will see the same thing, c3po, darth vader, yoda, and han solo voice without buy button next to them. use the ones at the bottom of english voice section, and just ignore the ones on the top of english voice section. now you see that the ones at the bottom of english voice section work just perfectly fine. i am sorry for the confussion. i should have just deleted the ones at the top of english voice section so that way you would not get confused."
