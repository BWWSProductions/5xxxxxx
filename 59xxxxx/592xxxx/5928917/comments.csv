,cheno1115,2010-11-03T03:33Z,"How do you get these keys? Do you make them yourself somehow? Or do you use actually legit keys that get blacklisted? 
I Mean, If you make them yourself, You could pass on the secret so that others could make their own key that will not be blacklisted as often.."

,precious-jezebel,2010-11-11T16:40Z,"Dear ChattChitto would you please upload new keys? you're the only one here that upload keys that i know how to download, i've tried others but there is no readme file or tutorial or nothing, i'm lost!!!!"
,red_soil,2010-11-13T07:21Z,"Hahaha...noobs! You have to apply the offline activation patch. I do not know if you have it but I uploaded a copy here:

http://www.aimini.net/view/?fid=Wrc4Fds7ZE3zesgAaPiK

Go there and download it, turn off self defense on KIS11 then exit KIS11. Apply the patch and your done! 
Now you can activate KIS11 using the offline method. 
When KIS11 restarts it will warn you of a hack tool program (thats the offline patcher), add it to your exclusions list. Tada !"
