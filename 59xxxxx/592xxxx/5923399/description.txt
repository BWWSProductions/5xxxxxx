Work done:

Here we go with our version of RED a little late but non the less here it is.The reason 
for this release was we were asked by our folks to make a encode of RED. So here it is.
We noticed there was like 15 mins of nothing but black video at the end so we decided to
edit that out.We also decided to leave the logo property of there.we would have blurred
it but when we did it looked ugly and cropping it was out of the question specially 
since you would lose so much of the top. We did our normal stuff to it.We brighten We 
also worked on  the contrast,denoiser and finally a sharpen filter to it.
Hope you all enjoy from team FLAWL3SS.
