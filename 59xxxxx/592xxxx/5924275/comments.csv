,jjacobslooksee,2011-12-19T21:51Z,"I downloaded into Windows 7 OS, 64 bit & Windows Vista 32 bit--both downloaded quickly & installed well.  I am new to Sandboxie and am anxious to try it.  When I saw the program download it looked like an excellent security tool.  Thanks for introducing it to our home network! "
