   1  California Dreamin' - Mama's & The Papa's
   2  96 tears - ? And The Mysterians
   3  What Becomes Of The Brokenhearted - Jimmy Ruffin
   4  Last Train To Clarksville - Monkees
   5  Reach Out, I'll Be There - Four Tops

I have the Billboard book by Joe Edwards that has all the top 100s listed."
