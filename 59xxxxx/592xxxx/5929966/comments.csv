,MCF3778,2010-11-07T05:53Z,no really.... how about unpack them!
,donkerinternet,2010-11-07T16:28Z,"to unpack you need winrar.
Select all files exept the .nfo file > Right click and hit unpack
DUH!"
,riggsthecat1,2010-11-08T01:45Z,"you only need to extract the first ""rared"" file, double duh!"
,riggsthecat1,2010-11-08T23:18Z,Yep any rar file will do.....my point was you don't have to select them all....duh infinity!
,MCF3778,2010-11-10T00:49Z,some people pack them wrong so you never go wrong with highlighting all rar's and right click and select extract here.
