Thanks,

,careyfleet,2010-12-11T15:33Z,"Hi again UfoMan33,

First off, thanks for your support and enthusiasm. I have checked the file and can confirm that there is nothing wrong with it. What problems are you having? The file type is .7z which is a compression format used by the 7-Zip program. It may be easier to download this as all of my torrents will use this method due to my favouritism over other compression software. To download, go here:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/files/7-Zip/9.20/7z920.exe/download

Please remember to e-mail me with problems you have encountered to recieve a faster response. Also, your request has been notified and will be uploaded as soon as possible.

Thanks,
DOS-Carey"
