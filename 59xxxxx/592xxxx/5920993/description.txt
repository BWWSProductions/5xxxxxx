Maybe you have been looking, like I was, for V8.5 of AVG?  Well, your search is over!  Here is avg_free_stf_en_85_420a1708.exe that I found online at:
docsdownloads .com /avg8.htm

Thank you DoC!!!

V8.5 still allows daily virus definition updates.  I prefer V8.5 over V9.0 since V9.0 seems to be a little more "resource hoggy", plus I like in V8.5 that I can choose "Exit" from the System Tray (yeah, yeah, I know choosing "Exit" does not fully terminate all AVG processes...).

There is at least one other torrent out there for AVG FREE 8.5, but I found what I to believe to be the very last install version of V8.5...
