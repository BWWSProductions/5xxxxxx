,no.way,2010-12-20T09:23Z,"It appears, I think, that ability to update AVG V8.5 is ending as of 12-31-2010...  I guess I'll go to the 2011 version, which techsupportalert .com has rated as fairly good by saying, ""Although this venerable antivirus has had some shaky results in detection in the recent past, it now offers a high level of protection.""  See the review here:  www .techsupportalert .com/best-free-anti-virus-software .htm"
