,Barebonexxx,2010-12-18T03:00Z,Good to see that is still alive!
,geodavids,2010-12-22T05:11Z,Doesn't work don't download.
,Barebonexxx,2010-12-22T19:07Z,"What do mean ""Doesn't work"". Have been seeding this for months now, nobody has complained yet. What player do you use? This is MKV-format, can't play that in Windows Mediaplayer..."
,piefka_juggalo,2011-01-16T13:15Z,"Endgame is the fourth movie, so this torrent includes 1, 2 and 4, the description is the third movie, but the file is definitely Endgame"
,jake16,2011-03-02T21:29Z,"Great torrent - Thank You!

Can you please tell me if there is a way to turn off the subtitles?

Thank you again!"
,Barebonexxx,2011-03-05T08:25Z,"It all depends on what kind of player you use to turn off subtitles.

VLC Player - Right click during playing the movie, Video - Subtitles Track - Disable.

If you use a media box, well, read the manual."

,mcrux,2011-04-07T21:39Z,These are excellent copies at very high compression rates.  Fucking Excellent.  I own this DVD and it was scratched so I downloaded it.  This copy is better than my original store bought.  Thank you.
,Barebonexxx,2011-04-08T22:09Z,I'm pleased to hear that! I DO my effort to keep the quality high.
,MCMGM,2011-04-14T00:01Z,Not to nitpick but Endgame is the FOURTH movie. 
,Barebonexxx,2011-04-16T11:20Z,So I learned... :-)
,haplo89,2011-05-11T20:42Z,"i seem to have some difficulty with playing these mkv files, VLC says it is each move is a file of 1,3Gb but also says it contains 0 sec of movie, any thoughts on how to fix this pls."
,Barebonexxx,2011-05-13T12:59Z,"Are you sure that they are alle 100% downloaded? You may not have got the ""stop bit"" for them.

Or try mkvtoolnix to analyze or rebuild them."
,haplo89,2011-05-13T17:31Z,"thx, i have downloaded them to 100% for sure, ill try the mkvtoolnix."
