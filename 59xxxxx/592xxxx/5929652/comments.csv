,wetmouse,2010-11-02T20:00Z,The lunatic fringe finally have their own little party all to themselves. The Republicans are going to have to appeal even more to the low-IQ crowd now to win the Nazis back.
[V],rambam1776,2010-11-02T20:30Z,"The simple fact that fools like you dismiss these people and their concerns as the 'lunatic fringe' is a very large part of why the GOP is set to sweep to victory today. Continue to both ignore their concerns and to call them silly names, thinking they don't represent anyone but a small 'lunatic fringe', and watch how fast Obama is dumped from office in 2012. This is a large cross-section of real voters, not a tiny collection of whackjobs. If you honestly don't like and oppose them, then dismissing them is further evidence (other than your idiotic TPB comments) of your stupidity."
,dzlrules,2010-11-02T23:13Z,"@wetmouse- Your nic is quite fitting as your logic is only, as flawed as the main stream news agency that told you how to think. Wouldn't it surprise you to know that the so-called ""tea party"" not only has former republican voters but, democrat and independents as well. I guess though, that'd simply be to much for your weak, feeble mind to consider.

See you in the cheese & peanut butter line! If you cut in front of me though, I'll stick a fork in you and call you done

@rambam1776 - Thanks for the up!"
,r0ttiem0m,2010-11-03T07:15Z,@dzlrules  My thoughts exactly!  Thanks rambam for the up.  I'll seed as long as I can!
