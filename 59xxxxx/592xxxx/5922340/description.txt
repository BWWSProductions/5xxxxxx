2004 Dialogue    CD  BMG UK 82876615802 


A superb album of chilled, intelligent, melodic pop. Deserves to be MUCH better known. Prefab Sprout, Blue Nile, maybe the melodic side of Cocteau Twins, even Dido, are the closest reference points. Truth Hurts, Act Like You Know Her, Come Undone and Reconcile are good places to start, but there hardly a poor track.
