ur previous torrent already contain this,but also the sims pack,so its too large, i would appreciate much if u make new torrent only contain those add-on/store items for those who already install the sims 3 and the expansions

ps: for the one above me, no virus at all, ur antivirus maybe too sensitive, it recognized the crack folder as virus"

you can disable downloading from your torrent manager the Sims 3 and expansions in his previous upload to just download the stuff you needed like the addons and EA store stuff

,nickaburr,2010-12-10T00:48Z,"Disk Authorization Failure. :(
Can't find the cracked file in the late night iso... I installed all the expansions in order like the instructions said.
Help?"
,jcsj,2010-12-11T00:20Z,"Finally finished the download, took me a while to install things due to patching errors, region errors and other stuff like that but managed to get them running.

I recommend to patch update the Sims 3 and all its expansions and then applying the updated crack to late night. This fixes massive bugs and other things in the game

UPDATED PATCHES 
http://widowmaker.kiev.ua/sims3updates.php

UPDATED CRACKS
http://tehparadox.com/forum/f43/sims-3-all-expansions-stuff-packs-cracked-files-patch-17-onwards-1473431/

-Install Sims 3 then update latest patch (DO NOT PUT ANY CRACKS YET)

-Install World Adventures then update latest patch (DO NOT PUT ANY CRACKS YET)

-Install High End Loft Stuff, update and again NO cracks

-Install Ambitions, update, NO CRACK

-Install Fast Lane, update it, no crack

-Install Late Night, patch it up, and then copy the crack that matches your patch update (6.1.11 patch and crack recommended)

Start the game using Late Night and if you did all those steps properly, it ill work. Make a backup of the files from Late Night that will be cracked for future expansions and updates (TSLHost.dll AND TS3EP03)

TO ALL HAVING DISC AUTHORIZATION FAILURES
You have to deactivate any image mounting programs in your PC like Alcohol120% and PowerISO before starting the game. Change the number of Virtual Drives to 0 or remove it completely.

Do you by any chance know how to fix this?
Thanks up front!"
,jcsj,2010-12-19T02:54Z,"moreghan:

Just change the SKU of the Sims 3 in the registry between 0-7. The 0-7 represents the region code.

Step-By-Step (this is done in Vista 64-bit)

-Go to the Windows search bar and type ""regedit"" and go there

-Go to the folders in order
HKEY LOCAL MACHINE --> SOFTWARE --> WOW6432NODE --> Sims

-You can find the registry for Sims 3 and its expansions here, now click The Sims 3 folder there, on the side where its states the Name, type and Data, right-click SKU. Modify, and change the value between 0-7 until the patch works. Don't close regedit yet, change it, if it still fails, change it again.

I think the registry folders for Sims 3 differ in 64-bit OS than 32-bit OS. IDK. Tell me if you got it working

,norabaron,2011-01-13T10:59Z,"Alright, I'm giving up my stubborn lurker ways to ask for help. 
I downloaded this torrent (thanks, BONE!), installed the expansion packs (smooth sailing), cracked it, tried to open it -- and got a black screen. Had to Task-Manager it out of there. 
A bit of fiddling with the mods got me through to the loading screen (terribly exciting), but that ended (anticlimactically) with a disc authentication error (rats!). So, reading the comments and finding jcsj's oh-so-helpful post, I downloaded the updated crack and un-mounted the image, and was on the edge of my seat with anticipation when, instead of a disc authentication error, I got the following message: ""No game disc found! Please insert The Sims 3 Late Night game disc before proceeding. (Retry/Quit)""
I am at a loss, and so humbly write to thee, O More Experienced Pirates, to aid me in my hour(s) of need! Woe, and betide, and all that jazz.
Sincerely,

1. open it with your iso

4. go to c drive/programfiles/electronicarts/sims 3 late night and then go to game. then bin and drag the files from the iso under CRACK into the late night folder on the c drive. it will ask you if you want to replace the old files under that name. You say yes

,CACR,2011-05-14T01:41Z,"This torrent works. 
Thank you Bone!


@Faelynn the reason you can't verify is because you haven't cracked the game yet. After you crack the game, it works. 


***After you have installed & patched all of the expansions, you must crack the ""Late night"" one in order to be able to play.

-First thing you must do is mount the ""late night"" game.

-Then go to computer and right click on the E drive and hit ""explore"".

-After that you will see a folder than says ""crack"". Click and copy/paste the sims ""Icon""

- Now go back to computer, and C drive, program files, electronic arts, Sims 3 Late night and look for the ""Game"" file. 

- Now click on ""Bin"" and once there right click on the page and ""paste"" the crack icon.

- Now it will ask you if you want to replace the old file and you must say ""Yes""

- Now you can run the game!


I hope that helped a little.
