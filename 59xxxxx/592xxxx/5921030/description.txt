Lyrics

I don't need you or your brand new Benz, or your bougie friends

I don't need love lookin' like diamonds, lookin' like diamonds

Get sleazy (repeat)

I'mma get
Get
I'mma get
Get
Oooh


[chorus]
I don't need you or your brand new Benz, or your bougie friends

I don't need love lookin' like diamonds, lookin' like diamonds

I don't need you or your brand new Benz, or your bougie friends

I don't need love lookin' like diamonds, lookin' like diamonds

You can't imagine the immensity of the system that giving about your money and the surf and turf and mansion that your live in. And I don't want to places where all my ladies can't get in, just grab a bottle some boys and lets take it back to my basement. And get sleazy assisted by your lines so cheesy, sorry daddy but I'm not that easy. I'm not gonna' sit here while you circle jerk it on my tit. Imma' take it back to where my man and my girls is.

Sleazy get sleazy (repeat)


[chorus]
I don't need you or your brand new Benz, or your bougie friends

I don't need love lookin' like diamonds, lookin' like diamonds

I don't need you or your brand new Benz, or your bougie friends

I don't need love lookin' like diamonds, lookin' like diamonds

Rat a tat tat on your dum dum drum the beats so phat gonna make me cum (over to our place)
Rat a tat tat on your dum dum drum the beats so phat gonna make me cum (over to our place)

I don't mean to critique on your seduction technique, but your money's not impressing me it's kind of weak. That you really think your gonna get my rocks off, get my top and socks off by showing me the dollars in your drop box. Me and all my friends we don't buy bottles, we bring em. We take the drinks from the tables when you get up and leave em. And I don't care if you stare and you call us scummy, cause you ain't a figure of affection and sure as hell not your money hunny.

[chorus]
I don't need you or your brand new Benz, or your bougie friends

I don't need love lookin' like diamonds, lookin' like diamonds

I don't need you or your brand new Benz, or your bougie friends

I don't need love lookin' like diamonds, lookin' like diamonds


Rat a tat tat on your dum dum drum the beats so phat gonna make me cum (over to our place)
