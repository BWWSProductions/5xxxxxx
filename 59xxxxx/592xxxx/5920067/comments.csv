[V],globeplus,2010-10-30T06:42Z,"To mhcvel :  in this case was the best option analising the structure of the games files , the file have the most important event the Campaign and the FreePlay because was more than 1.5 gb and have only 3 extra events , probably can be nice to play but i canÂ´t see a player going to play the freeplay before at least finish the all campaign , and if you play the all campaign probably is enough and the freeplay beside can be nice can be a little borring after all the campaign unless you are a real fan , i know the ideal is always the all thing but for pratical files and with many nice pc games around to be played , this is the fair work for a pratical file . Thank you and enjoy your game ."

,viperstrikes,2010-10-30T15:08Z,"Globeplus,CR09 is talking about new skateboarding game which has released in the last week. Seems like you are confusing skateboarding with snowboarding which was an older game."
[V],globeplus,2010-10-30T21:17Z,"To viperstrikes and CR09 : sorry , i didn´t know it and i didn´t get the name correct , the true is that i don´t have it , if in the future i get the possibility maybe i take a look without compromise , sorry about the confusion and happy gaming to this one ."

Google them and download and install them, only then you can run the game. "
