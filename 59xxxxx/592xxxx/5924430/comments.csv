,YULYRAPID,2010-11-05T22:15Z,"All this are very strange... after ESPALAND (NDS) gone ALL the uploaders use the M3i cards for NDS and the games no work for others... why nobody for the rest of the cards (TTDS, R4i, R4, R4 GOLD etc..)???? There are 3-4 new uploaders for NDS all use the M3i... maybe they don't care about the rest..."

Hello m8

You just need this new kernel (software) 
http://www.r4ds-r4i.com/pages/R4i-Gold-Kernel-Download.html

It's the newest one

1: First format your sdhc card (the little black one) 
2: Then put this kernel on it (the link i just say)
3:Then put any games on the card
4: Play and have fun for free

Cheers
