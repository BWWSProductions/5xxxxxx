Vince Vaughn stars as Clay Hewitt, a drifter who wanders into a small Kansas town and quickly becomes popular. Soon after arriving he punches out the local town drunk, falls in love with local beauty Kitty (Ashley Judd), and is hired on the local feed ranch, which is owned by the alcoholic widow Delilah (Kate Capshaw). Delilah is notorious for her admiration of younger men, allowing Clay to stay in the carriage house on her estate. Delilah is sexually attracted to Clay, which is her primary reason for offering him a place to stay. Her son Flyboy (Jeremy Davies) had recently returned from a mental hospital and hasn't said a word to anyone other than his pet bull. Clay slowly breaks Flyboy out of his shell, which unleashes a complex turn of events.
