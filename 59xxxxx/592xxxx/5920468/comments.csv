Do you watch all/most of these yourself!? You must have a brilliant eclectic knowledge."
[V],dohduhdah,2011-01-28T14:40Z,"I do love to watch most of the videos I upload, but sometimes it feels like drowning in information, given that there is such a wealth of material available via p2p. Still, I think it's very edifying to watch TTC videos and art/science documentaries.
I'm just an average idiot and basically I just pass things on from one bittorrent site to the other.
Credits belong to the people who create this stuff and those who rip it and make it available on p2p."
