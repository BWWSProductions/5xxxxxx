When I first heard this record, I found that Victoria Williams' voice took some getting used to. That was, of course, ten years before Joanna Newsom, and anybody liking Newsom and complaining about Williams should better shut up really fast. Besides, Williams' voice sounds perfectly normal as soon as you've reached the second song on this album.

Diagnosed with MS in the early `90s,Victoria found herself in deep in money problems.Some help by her musical friends recorded her songs on a benefit album called Sweet Relief in 1993 which featured artists like Lou Reed,The Jayhawks,Giant Sand,Michelle Shocked,Pearl Jam,etc. 
This album from not long after that features some of her past songs and new ones."Century Plant","You R Loved",the jazzy "Harry Went To Heaven",a duet with her husband Mark Olson on "When We Sing Together","Waterfall",and her classic(and problably best song ever)"Crazy Mary".Victoria is not loud enough for indie rock fans and not pop enough or too unusual for the Lilith crowd so she`s in a category by herself.
