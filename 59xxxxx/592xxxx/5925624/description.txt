.[W4F PRESENTS]: Ninja.Warrior.S11E01.READNFO.PDTV.XviD-W4F

[DATE]: 11/01/2010

[GENRE]: Japanese Game Show

Description:

Ninja Warrior is the Americanised version of the Japanese 'Sasuke'.
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasuke_%28TV_series%29

We have decided to start releasing this as it is an awesome show, but 
has received so little attention from the scene, and so it is very hard 
to find quality rips of this.

Firstly on the labelling, the actual G4TV airing is a complete mess, we 
have gone with the original Japanese tournament number and part, 
which is much more logical. ie this is the 1st part of the 11th 
tournament.

Secondly, this season is very old. We just got this episode in 
Australia, the original Ninja Warrior broadcast of it is from a few of 
years ago in the US, while the original Japanese broadcast is from 
2003.  Again though, it has not been capped and won't be coming out 
on DVD.



We encourage other groups to start capping this great show! We only 
get it weekly here in Australia, apparently it airs daily in the US on 
G4TV. There is also a new 'American Ninja Warrior' coming in 
December...

If you have trouble identifying which season it is, check out

obstacles and time limits.


Long live Sasuke!
