In Lapa, Rio de Janeiro, the idle aspirant writer Zeca has been living with Arts Professor JÃºlia for five years. He is stuck on page 50 of his novel for a long time and Zeca claims lack of inspiration to conclude the plot. He leads a comfortable life from inheritance left by his mother and administrated by his father Humberto. When Zeca sees JÃºlia alone with her best friend Carol in his flat, he believes that they are having a love affair and becomes obsessed with Carol, following her. JÃºlia travels to SÃ£o Paulo with work giving Zeca the perfect opportunity to have an affair with Carol. So begins his complicated life: while JÃºlia works and studies for her doctorate, Zeca has sex with Carol during the days and with JÃºlia during the nights. Zeca plots a scheme to stay with either Carol or JÃºlia but his plan does not go as he hoped.
