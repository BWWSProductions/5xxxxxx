,dillp,2010-12-02T03:04Z,NO SOUND!?
,dillp,2010-12-02T15:39Z,"The video is a perfect 10/10, but theres no audio."
[T],murdoc47,2010-12-04T11:26Z,"audio is 5.1 surround. try vlc player. (not guaranteed to work on consoles, only tried on PC)"
,dewaelsche,2010-12-09T02:58Z,"I know, thats the player I have. It won't work on PC or XBOX. I downloaded the file twice!... and nothing."
[T],murdoc47,2010-12-09T18:01Z,"in vlc player, right click. is there an audio 1? it works for me, and probably for others too, because it is being seeded still. i'm downloading it too to make sure. will get back to you."
[T],murdoc47,2010-12-09T18:23Z,"i downloaded it again. works fine. check your codecs and settings, dude!"
