,batranuu,2011-04-26T18:57Z,"""SYGIC Drive 10 SMM10 Full Europe + Romania Suncart 2010.06"" it's now running on my samsung omnia I900v with windows mobile 6.5.

This are the steps that i did to succeed:

	1 - I maked a folder into c:\ drive and i named it c:\sygic 2010

	2 - I copied all files, from the folder that i downloaded on torrent, in here

	3 - I copied on my phone in ""\My storage"" only ""C:\sygic 2010\smm10"" folder

	4 - From the folder keygen i opened SygicKG, and there 2 rows, one is for your .mlm file and the other one is for your device ID.

	5 - First i taped the device ID (which I'll explain how to get it) and after i browsed for .mlm file.

	6 - To get your device id you will have to run the application like this: find drive.exe (mine is \My storage\smm10\drive\Windows Mobile\Drive.exe);

	7 - May at first appear a black screen about 15 sec and should be able to set up software (your language, voice, sounds, keyboard, etc.). At this 
	    first run you will not be abble to view maps but you can go on ""Settings"" at ""About Sygic Mobile"", here is your device code wich you will type 
	    on SygicKG at Device ID.

	8 - Now exit from the Sygic software from your phone and browse on SygicKG program after your .mlm file 
	    (mine is located in \My storage\smm10\Maps\Europe+Romania.mlm)

	9 - Now click ""Generate"".

	10 - Now follow the steps from number 6 and activate your maps with serial number that was generated

	11 - Now planning your route."
