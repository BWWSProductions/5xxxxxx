,Blanko2,2010-11-21T03:53Z,"i was led to believe that there is a version of system shock where shodan is voiced and one where she isnt. is this the voiced one?
or is that information wrong and there is no unvoiced one?"
,careyfleet,2010-11-25T22:30Z,"Hi Blanko2,

Sorry, but I couldn't tell you! Unfortunately I have never played most of the games that I upload. They are purely for the community. I provide the game, torrent content, and the upload of the torrent itself. Other than that, it's down to you.

Thanks,
DOS-Carey"
,STFUuNoob,2012-04-07T13:38Z,"@Blanko2, there was a floppy disc version and a CD version, and the CD version had voices (SHODAN, the logs you pick up during the game, etc). The floppy version obviously doesn't. Since this is 85.42 MiB, I'd say it's the CD version..."
,moo5000,2012-06-13T09:42Z,"This actually does appear to be the floppy disk version. I'm not hearing any voiceovers.

The torrent works great, and runs well. Instructions included are easy to follow. Outstanding game, you have to give it a go."
