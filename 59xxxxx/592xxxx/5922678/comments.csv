I Get stuck @ the running with the wolves mission after i mark the 3'rd truck .. some 1 called Dusty supposed give me a hand 2 help me climb a wall .. but guess what !! He doesn't, & I get stuck ...
BTW my name n the mission is Deuce"
,firebirdude,2011-06-06T05:09Z,"Got everything working. But I get through half of the second mission (clear the warehouse, just after the airplane bone yard) and there's a fatal video/game rendering error in which the floor disappears anywhere outside the warehouse. You just fall endlessly to your death as you watch the entire map get smaller above you. Pretty much the end of the game..."
