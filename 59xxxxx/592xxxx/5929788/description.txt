Magnolia Plantation

Season 2, Episode 4 â€“ Aired: 6/26/2009
 
The Ghost Adventures crew travels to Natchitoches, LA, to investigate the Magnolia Plantation. It's the first time any paranormal team has ever been allowed to investigate the plantation. Built in 1830 to grow and harvest cotton, it consists of 5,000 acres of land. Shamefully, many slaves labored and died in the vast farming fields of the plantation. Today it has been taken over by the National Park Service in an attempt to preserve its history. The Ghost Adventures crew uncovers evidence of voodoo rituals that many of the slaves used to seek revenge on the plantation owners. The spirits of the repressed and tortured souls are still alive in this national park.
