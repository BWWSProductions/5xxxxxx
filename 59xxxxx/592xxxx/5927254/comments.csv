These Are Torrents...Yes The Files To Be Downloaded Are Torrents......

Thanks Man For Ur Effort & Be Honest By Not Putting Any Funny Item...

Thanks To The Uploader...."
,rogamosh,2010-11-02T00:58Z,"At Least He Is Trying To Help People.....Not Like Us....Don't Ever Post A Stupid Comment Like This Without Viewing The Content.....

And No No I m not The Uploader....I Haven't Uploaded Anything Yet.....But We Can Download Everything Free Of Cost Just Because People Like These Are Uploading....

So Whatever It Is If Not A Virus, He Doesn't Deserve Stupid Comments Like This Instead A Thanks.....Isn't It???"
,rogamosh,2010-11-02T02:26Z,"Maybe He Has Given The Best Torrents For Each Of Them.....Who Knows???

Try To Understand The Intention Behind That.....He Obviously Didn't Upload This For Himself....So What May Be The Reason U Think???

Apart From That All These May Be His Own Torrent....May Be He Is Trying To Distribute Them Together.....

Giving Credit To Others Is A Very Very Important Habit Dear...It's Very Important In Our Personal Relations Too...

If U R A Person Who Never Hesitates To Give Credits To Others U Never Need A Reason...U Will Find It But If U Bother To Do So U Will Never Find A Reason To Give Someone Credit....And Always Find That ""He Hasn't Done Anything Special......""

So Try To Understand The Intention Of Others Not The Effort....

A Person Can't Always Be Too Good But The Important Thing Is How Much He Is Intended To Be Good....

If U Are In Pain In front Of Ur Mom & She Has Nothing To Do Then It's Not That She Is Not Doing Anything But She Has Limitations Yet She Is Trying Her Best To Do Anything That's Called The ""INTENTION""....."
,knandan,2010-11-02T02:50Z,"these are verified torrents from  diff sources put together as a collection. and the credit of course goes to the core team for cracking it. cheers to them. two keygens generate false alarms in anti virus programs but then again keygens are not harmful trojans. the installation procedure for each of the apps are included in the folders itself. just make sure u follow the procedure correctly.
these are not fake , i am using them all right now."
,knandan,2010-11-02T02:54Z,im using all these apps right now. just the anonymus status cause not sure whether to show the user name or not. first torrent u see B)

Okay If U Don't Trust Then Don't Download Just Leave It But Without Knowing What Is It Don't Post Idiotic Comments My Friend.....

This Is Not Wisdom As Far As I Understand......

Grow Up Boy & Another Suggestion If U Are So Careful That U Post Comments To Prevent Others From Downloading A File Without Knowing What Is It Then What R U Doing Here???
Go & Buy Original Softwares & If U Can't Effort Then Just Sell Ur PC Or Laptop.....

We Need Pirated Version But We Can't Take Risk At All Even We Are Suspicious About Everything Because It Was Uploaded By An Anonymous.....

Don't U Thing That U R Expecting A Little Bit Extra???

Go Buy Some Original Softwares, Games, Movies Whatever U Want & If U Can't Effort Them Then Just Don't Post Idiotic Comments Ever.....

At Least Check The File Type 1st By Clicking The ""Download this torrent"" Link & If U Find Something Suspicious Then Simply Don't Download It.....

Isn't It Easy???"
,knandan,2010-11-02T13:12Z,"@rogamosh thanks for the support and guys please stop fighting

@djjlicious here- i am the one who uploaded this stuff.

and yeah as i said this is my first ever torrent that i made and i thought i shouldnt put my username in it. dunno why, just a precaution, but heck who cares. im not able to edit this torrent also now.. showing some error.

and yeah, going by the traits i definitely have been around with torrent more than you and i DONT CARE if it was uploaded by an anonymous cause its available for sharing and free of cost! what more do you require, i always try the torrent no matter what b4 commenting and WTF do you have ur antivirus software for? even if were a virus your av should detect it just fine and delete the torrent and then report them of the virus. have some professional attitude dude, we r in a file sharing community and waging a war against the copyright holders. we should not be fighting among ourselves. so.. always check a torrent b4 commenting, ALWAYS! 

@promodsharma - if you dont download and check it out for ur self YOU ARE THE BIGGEST FOOL!  im not losing anything, im just trying to share something which is scattered all over the places and i had to go through hell in finding some apps so i made a collection and uploaded so if u doubt anything DO NOT download and dont comment either! 

coming to think of it i din know so many noobs existed! 

@rogamosh - dude its cause of ppl like you newbies are able to upload a torrent and keep it alive! Thanks for the support!

cheers to The Pirate Bay! cheers to the file sharing community!

and heres a little info to all you downloaders - DONT scream at the uploader if u find a virus in keygens! keygens are supposed to be of that shit and they aint harmless! So Shut The Fuck Up and download if you want to!"

Look Who Are Nuts...Everyone Is Appreciating This Except U....."
,Cristo,2010-11-14T17:42Z,You may edit/delete your torrent your self by going to your uploaded torrents and clicking the edit tab for the desired torrent or choose the x to delete.
,rogamosh,2010-12-21T23:40Z,I m glad to see that this torrent has not been deleted....
