Release notes:

Nearly two years since the release of their last album 'Seeing Sounds', N*E*R*D
are back with their fourth studio album 'Nothing'. The lead single from the
album - 'Hot N Fun' gives a flavour of the record and also features Nelly
Furtado.

'Hot N Fun' is a bounce-filled, sweaty summer club track that has echoes of
old-school roller-skating jams. (Astute music heads may hear a trace of De La
Soul influences in the song's bravado, which Pharrell admits could be the case:
"No matter what I do or who I work with, the Native Tongues are in my DNA.").

Enjoy!
