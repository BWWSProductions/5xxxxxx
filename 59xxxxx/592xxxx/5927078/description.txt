Apples, the latest album in a thirty-year recording career, sees June Tabor on characteristically excellent form. Like 2003â€™s Echo of Hooves, the album almost entirely focuses on the traditional rather than the contemporary. This means stressing the folk aspect of her work over art songs, although when the playing and singing bite as deeply as if often does here, such distinctions become irrelevant. If Taborâ€™s voice tends towards the autumnal and the tragic, then the sparse backgrounds here are relieved by Andy Cuttingâ€™s accordion, particularly on tracks such as â€œThe Dancingâ€, â€œThe Auld Beggarmanâ€ and â€œCe Fu en Maiâ€.


The albumâ€™s title suggests a thematic scheme like 2001â€™s Roses, but is less literal and more suggestive. It moves from love to war, contrasting betrayal and steadfastness but emphasizing remembrance (perhaps the titleâ€™s clearest attributable meaning). The collection includes classic Scottish love songs (â€œThe Rigs of Ryeâ€) century- old English and American ballads (â€œThe Old Garden Gateâ€ and â€œI Love My Loveâ€), and others that date back hundreds of years, including â€œAu Logis De Mon Pereâ€, a descendant of the 11th-century â€œAu Pommier Douxâ€, that sees three girls asleep under an apple tree, mistaking the light of battle for the light of dawn. It is a measure of this albumâ€™s beauty of execution that these traditional songs sit perfectly next to contemporary numbers such as â€œStanding in Lineâ€, perhaps this albumâ€™s most powerful evocation of the effects of war, and one not dissimilar from â€œThe Band Played Waltzing Matildaâ€, which Tabor covered on her 1976 debut Airs and Graces.


It would be unhelpful to describe this as Taborâ€™s â€˜bestâ€™ album to date when she has already set such high standards, but it certainly passes muster; Taborâ€™s voice is superb throughout (never more so than on Hector MacMillanâ€™s arrangement of Robbie Burnsâ€™ â€œSpeakeasyâ€), delving deeply into tradition to reveal the art that was always there. Yes, we do like these apples.
