What the Bleep 2: Down the Rabbit Hole is a radical departure from convention. It demands a freedom of view and greatness of thought so far unknown, indeed, not even dreamed of since Copernicus. Its a documentary. It's a story. Its mind-blowing special effects. This film plunges you into a world where quantum uncertainty is demonstrated - where neurological processes, and perceptual shifts are engaged and lived by its protagonist - where everything is alive, and reality is changed by every thought.

Originally released in February 2004 in one theater in Yelm, Washington, What the BLEEP Do We Know!? went on to become the fifth highest grossing documentary in the United States, with ticket sales of 12 Million.

Shunned by all movie distributors, the producers set about distributing and marketing the movie themselves in a â€œproof of conceptâ€ strategy to show theater owners there was indeed a market for spiritually oriented films that catered to audiencesâ€™ intelligence, not their lowest common denominator.
