Release notes:

Cheryl Cole releases her second album 'Messy Little Raindrops' on 1st November
through Polydor Records.

Work on the new album started with writing sessions the day after Cheryl's
storming performance at The Brits in February where she won Best Single for
'Fight For This Love.'

The first song to be recorded was the lead single from this album, 'Promise
This,' with Wayne Wilkins. The single has already become a favourite with fans
and is one of the fastest growing songs on UK radio.

The new album once again fuses pop, R&B and dance and sees Cheryl working with a
range of new producers including Starsmith [Ellie Goulding/Kylie Minogue] Shux
[Jay Z] and JR Rotem [Rihanna/Jason Derulo]. The album also includes some
special collaborations from Dizzee Rascal on the song 'Everybody Everyone' and
Travie McCoy on 'Yeah Yeah'.

Last year Cheryl Cole firmly established herself as one of the UK's most
successful pop stars. Her debut album '3 Words' rocketed to the top of the
charts and swiftly went on to become triple-platinum [900,000 sales]. Lead
single 'Fight For This Love' became the fastest selling single of the year and
blasted to #1 and both '3 Words' and 'Parachute' also made the top five. They
not only became permanent fixtures on TV and playlists, the singles sold over
1.5 million in the UK.

This spring  joined Black Eyed Peas as a special guest on their tour and wowed
crowds as a live performer. The tour saw Cheryl perform at venues across Europe.
"Cole's performance was strong...with capable, soaring vocals" commented the
Independent.

In between all of this Cheryl Cole has been keeping busy with her third season
as a judge on the #1 rated TV show, The X-Factor. She has already mentored two
winners to success. In addition, Cheryl has been appointed an ambassador for
L'Oreal Paris and of course continues to be an integral part of Girls Aloud.

Enjoy!
