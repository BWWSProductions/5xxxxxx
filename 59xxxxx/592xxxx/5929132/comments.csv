[V],twentyforty,2010-11-02T15:27Z,2nd part - TwoTowers (words) wont show up due to malfunctioning TPB
,nemesis160,2010-11-02T16:06Z,ok man thanks a lot that was real quick
,t.trikiti,2010-11-02T16:18Z,Great!
,t.trikiti,2010-11-02T16:20Z,hey I've been downloading Movies.Different-Garage.Sale.3[server.cleanup] for ever now! can some one seed please! really...like for more then 2 weeks!!
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-02T17:13Z,"@t.trikiti:There is written

""NOTE: TimeToLive 48h (torrent's TTL)""

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5886431/Movies.Different-Garage.Sale.3[server.cleanup]

server.cleanup means exactly that.

I can, however, maybe seed one movie of your choice from that Pack, pretty slow, from home.

Choose one or one near the finish (Files Tab) and let me know."
,justregged,2010-11-02T18:36Z,"Hi 20-40 i just seen that Life is Beautiful is out on blu-ray is there any chance you could do an encode, i love this film but all i have is a very poor quality encode. Please if you can thanks."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-02T18:53Z,"@justregged: Yeah, for two days now. I would encode one, but you should search for XviDs because I know for a fact that several nice rips exists. If you can, save me a little."
,hkoraddi,2010-11-02T20:02Z,Epic movies thanks for those
,justregged,2010-11-02T20:12Z,"Its ok dont worry about it, i know you have alot on your plate, was looking for something of higher res than whats around atm but im sure its just a matter of time before someone rips it so i'll wait it out for now. Anyway thanks for the reply i hate when people dont reply so cheers :)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-02T20:58Z,@justregged: I would do it. It is a long movie and 480p sound better if I preserve a max of 700 MB. I'll look into it and make 720p/700MB if possible.
,justregged,2010-11-02T21:42Z,"Ok cheers if you can do, theres no rush as i said i know you have alot on your plate, i dont know of an uploader that does as much as you so maybe when you have a free slot if there is such a thing lol"
,neeru,2010-11-02T21:45Z,"HI twentyforty!! BIG fan of your work

could you please restrict the size of tv show packs (to lets say packs/parts of 700 mb)?
problem with big downloads is that lesser number of ppl seed and it takes forever to dowload to be able to seed."
,justregged,2010-11-02T21:50Z,sorry forgot to check you will be doing it with original audio? I hate dubbed stuff and as for resolution i will leave it up to you i watched your encode of please give last night which was 480p and was great so if you want to do it at that then good :)

,skillet92,2010-11-03T06:31Z,"@t.trikiti
I can seed only Se7en from that torrent!
it would be very slow!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-03T06:33Z,"Minus one moron was here. Fine. Now, let's continue in that tune... (kidding):

Thanks for thanking.

@harshal112: Yes. In fact, I asked myself the same like three days ago.

@justregged: I hate dubbed audio too. BluRay has luckily Italian audio only."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-03T06:42Z,@neeru: Even more inconvenient is to have one free slot and 6 shows to release. I do all things after long and thorough analysis.
,milayaa,2010-11-03T07:32Z,"Hey 20-40 many thanks....a request... well 3 requests...whenever its convenient to you... if u can get a good copy.. the 1st one is a must watch for all movie lovers... havent seen the other 2 yet... its a trilogy by Alejandro González Iñárritu

[V],twentyforty,2010-11-03T09:15Z,"@milayaa: Of course, first two as BluRay and third as HDDVD (BluRay was released in Japan, but I can't get it in reasonable time). However, request is huge indeed (long movies), it would take a while, but these are great movies."
,milayaa,2010-11-03T09:38Z,"one more request... whichever is easier for you.. and if u think its worth it...its in mandarin (so has to have subtitles... but as i said earlier after watching the movie you'd spent an hr pondering over it!

raise the red lantern

,milayaa,2010-11-03T09:42Z,no problem... you can take as long as you need... its for my collection to which you already contribute a lot!... am a cinematographer... so it helps to study... :)
