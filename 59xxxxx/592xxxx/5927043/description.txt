Tsatsiki, morsan och polisen (1999)

Little Tsatsiki, son of a single mother in Sweden, has never met his father, a Greek fisherman. Tsatsiki befriends a nice but straight-laced motorcycle policeman renting one of their rooms and decices he is the right guy for his mother, an amateur rock singer in love with her band's bass player. To take a break from all this romantic hassle it's time for a holiday trip, and Tsatsiki and his mother end up in the very same Greek village where Tsatsiki was conceived a decade earlier.
