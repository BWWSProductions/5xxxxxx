Release notes:

Rock sensations Good Charlotte are back with their highly anticipated fifth
full-length album Cardiology almost exactly 10 years after their self-titled
debut put them on the map as one of the most exciting bands of the decade.
Originally formed as a pop-punk band in Waldorf, Maryland, in 1996, Good
Charlotte - vocalist Joel Madden, guitarist Benji Madden, guitarist Billy
Martin, bassist Paul Thomas and the latest edition, drummer Dean Butterworth -
have penned countless mainstream radio hits such as "The Anthem," "Lifestyles of
the Rich & Famous" and "Hold On."

However more importantly the band have constantly reinvented themselves and
refused to limit their potential, whether that means supporting Justin
Timberlake on his FutureSex/LoveShow tour or collaborating with Avenged
Sevenfold's M. Shadows and Synyster Gates on their hit single "The River" from
Good Charlotte's 2007 full-length Good Morning Revival. That adventurous musical
persona continues with Cardiology, an album that features everything from the
dance floor-friendly first single "Like It's Her Birthday" to future GC anthems
such as "Silver Screen Romance," while still effortlessly retaining the band's
signature sound in the process. While in some ways Cardiology is a return to
form for these multiple Warped Tour headliners, it also manages to work in
elements from throughout the band's classic catalog to create an album that
simultaneously summarizes what Good Charlotte are all about and hints at where
they are headed in the future.

While musical trends can be fleeting, Good Charlotte have always proved
themselves to be a constant in the music world by sticking to their punk roots
without being afraid to expand their horizons and bring in new influences - and
Cardiology is just the latest chapter in the band's already unparalleled career.
We can't wait to see what the second decade holds in store with Good Charlotte
and share Cardiology with the band's myriad fans and supporters who have been
clamoring for this record.

Enjoy!
