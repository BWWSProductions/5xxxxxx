,Tippee,2010-11-01T01:35Z,"Getting an error:

The program cannot start because smoke_api.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.

I tried reinstalling a few times but it didn't work. Any ideas?"
,pherdar,2010-11-01T10:13Z,"Im getting an error too.
It said i missed some dll file.
I downloaded that file and put it in the game directory, but when i open the game now i hear the music, but get a black screen.

Any solution?"
,italianskill,2010-11-01T19:31Z,"To those who get that error, when the installation is complete, you get the option to install directX and MS visual C++. Just install them (even if you already have them installed)"
,MrSumOne,2010-11-01T22:32Z,When I load it it goes to a black screen with a frozen windows 7 loading cursor in the middle. Running higher than recommended on windows 7 32 bit with everything installed. Someone help?

I mounted it, installed it, also installed direct X and C++.
I've copied the cracked content but when i run DeathSpank.exe, a fatal error screen appears and says ""Steam must be running to play this game""

What's now?"

,dothackjhe,2011-09-08T10:04Z,"Tried the game on Windows 7 x64, it works. After installing the game, just copy the contents of the SKIDROW crack folder inside the ISO while mounted in a virtual drive over to the directory where the game is installed. "
,lorikj,2011-09-19T23:10Z,"I too seem to be having the black screen/audio only problem. I have Vista (not for long though)

Installed the game, fixed the dll file and cracked it. Still the same problem. 

Now im downloading the SKIDROW update to give it a try and see whats happening. Any help is more than welcome :)"
,lorikj,2011-09-20T17:29Z,"BLACKSCREEN FIX:

Ive figured it out: Just update your directx. 
Alternatively go to the DIRECTX folder inside the DeathSpank game directory (programfiles) and run this file: dxsetup.exe

That will fix it.

Enjoy and have fun playing this funny game :)"
