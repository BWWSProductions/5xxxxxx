                    New two-part drama adapted from the novel by  
                    Philippa Gregory about a young woman's   
                    psychological battle with her mother-in-law.  
                    Ruth's independent city life is turned upside  
                    down when she and her husband Patrick move into  
                    an isolated country cottage close to his  
                    parents. Ruth falls pregnant and, following a  
                    difficult birth, struggles to cope with her  
                    demanding baby. However, her subtly      
                    manipulative mother-in-law Elizabeth is always  
                    on hand to ease the tension, seizing every  
                    opportunity to take the child away to her own  
                    home.
