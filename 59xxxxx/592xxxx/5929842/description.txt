From the Infowars web site ::

On this election day, Alex welcomes to the show Bev Harris, founder of Black Box Voting Inc., a national nonpartisan, nonprofit elections watchdog group. In 2003, she exposed how Diebold voting machines can be manipulated and used for vote fraud. Harris also identified and broke the story on the criminal records of a number of individuals who owned, programmed, and printed ballots in the elections industry. She is the author of Black Box Voting: Ballot Tampering in the 21st Century. 
[2nd half of hour 1, first few minutes of hour 2]

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
