Work done:

Here we go with our version of PA2 a little late but non the less here it is.
We brighten this movie as much as we could but it's a movie shot mostly in the dark.Dark
scenes are more than watchable.Also we used IMAGINES audio so it will be the same at the
begining we the 3.5 minutes missing and cam audio used for it. We did our normal stuff to it.
We brighten We also worked on  the contrast,denoiser and finally a sharpen filter to it.
Hope you all enjoy from team FLAWL3SS.
