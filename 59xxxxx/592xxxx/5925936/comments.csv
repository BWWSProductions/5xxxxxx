As soon as someone will finished to download the file, it will go faster.

The first one need to be patient, I will seed."
,twistquist,2010-11-05T03:00Z,"Works perfectly!

Thanks for the UL"
,TheAngrySpanker,2010-11-07T18:17Z,"I got some problems making this work :/

First off, Ijust want to point out that I'm rather new to downloading torrents and all that, so I might have skipped some pretty obvious stuff.

Anyways, here's my problem; When I click ""Launch Game"" in the game setup thingy, the game wants me to type in a serial number before I can play the game. What do I type there? I didn't seem to find it in the Manual... :("
,KawMoc,2010-11-08T15:57Z,"@TheAngrySpanker: a serial file is provided in the folder. ""Serials.txt""
Open it and you will find some CD Keys, choose one, and enjoy !"
,komman123,2010-11-14T17:29Z,"well - im not sure if i did it wrong or annything. and i KNOW this should work for my mac, cause the demo worked. Well, when i unpacked it etc, and opened it. i wrote 111111111 ( +- ), cause i diddent look in the serial file and i think that have to be the problem. the only problem i have now is that if i try to uninstall or whatever, i cant write the serial again. because now when i open amnesia the game just becomes black and shuts down. annyone know how i can completly remoev amnesia from the mac do i can write the serial code again?"
,mattydawgw,2010-11-18T00:26Z,"Ok, downloaded perfectly fine, relatively fast. Entered serial and everything was working fine. Tried to launch game and pops up with error message. ""Amnesia quit unexpectedly"" I've tried the fixes shown here: http://geekmontage.com/texts/game-fixes-amnesia-the-dark-descent-crashing-lag-black-screen-freezing-sound-fixes/

But to no avail. Help please? Desperately want this game..."
,vichetmeng,2010-11-19T05:33Z,please seed !! :( I'm downloading at 5kb/s!! GOSH It's so fucking slow
,vichetmeng,2010-11-20T11:39Z,"Just downloaded the game... Wow, this game is awesome! Thanks for uploading..!"
,ahavacapcha,2010-11-21T21:39Z,"Guys, how do you solve the problem with control keys? It doesn't seem to work with WASD, only arrows and number keys work. When I try to change the WASD to something else but arrows or numbers, it keeps showing NONE in the primary control keys menu. Any ideas?"
,awesoemo,2010-11-29T17:21Z,Works perfectly! Thanks
,NickBolland,2010-12-12T11:16Z,"Just started downloading, and I'm now downloading at 1MB/s!!! Awesomeness! When it's done I will tell you if it works or not but reading the comments before me suggests it will work. Thanks KawMoc!"
,NickBolland,2010-12-12T11:54Z,"So I entered the first serial, launched the game but it suddenly stopped and gave me an error. I tried it again, and it works! Awesomeosity!"
,NickBolland,2010-12-12T11:58Z,"Ok, this is a bit strange. I just launched the game succesfully, but then applied some changes in graphics and so on. It told me to restart the game to make the changes happen, so I quit the game and restarted it, but now it keeps giving me the same error it did in the beginning..."
,NickBolland,2010-12-12T12:05Z,"Awh damn it, I can't get it to work again! Help!"
,NickBolland,2010-12-12T12:21Z,"Sorry for this last comment... it works now. I deleted it and reinstalled it and it works. Great torrent, will be seeding for a long time"
,KawMoc,2010-12-23T13:22Z,"@NickBolland:
It's a pleasure ! ;)"
,gold_lion,2010-12-31T21:22Z,"So I'm having the same problem, download successfully and i try to launch it and the screen goes blank followed by the game quitting. Anyone know what to do?"

,captainbootymcplunder,2011-01-29T23:49Z,"Game crashes on launch for me.

""Error!  Could not load main init file: config/main_init.cfg""

Any ideas how to fix?"

,BruenorBattlehammer,2011-02-27T10:33Z,"Great torrent, thanks KawMoc! "
,Vatreyez,2011-03-12T20:06Z,"First, be on a administrator account. then instead of running it hastily, actually move it to the applications folder and play it from there. Worked for me! :p"
,Friznutz,2011-03-19T05:00Z,"I will never torrent anything again! This gameâŚ. Changes you. 
I beg of you just play the demo and get a feel for it and if you only get a little scared then get this. At least pay for it. I did about half way into the game. (These guys have no money and cant make another game.) But seriously though. Don't download this first. Get the demo please!   "
,macLife04,2011-03-26T09:14Z,"Worked good for me. Install was clean, runs smooth.

Thanks for upload will give this a shot."
,JimmyHat408,2011-03-29T23:39Z,"I need some help with an issue starting this game up. any help would be appreciated. the first time i installed amnesia everything went smoothly until i entered in the serial key provided with the torrent. the game acted as if it was starting and went to a black screen then popped back tot he desktop with a ""closed unexpectedly"" after i pushed re launch i got this error ""Could not load main init file: config/main_init.cfg"" i have tried any fix that has been posted already. some help please?  "
,JimmyHat408,2011-03-29T23:42Z,"^ i have deleted re-downloaded and re-installed and it has never asked me for a CD-key again. i am wondering if there is a default folder for saved setting for this game that i may have missed that saved anything from my previous install? have been and will keep seeding, game reviews look awesome on youtube."
,JimmyHat408,2011-03-30T04:38Z,"it seems the problem i am having is called a ""black box"" error. not only am i having this issue with both the Mac and PC demos but the Mac and PC FULL product as well. i download the demo on steam as well with the same problems. i have been surfing around some threads and tried all of their suggestions but nothing works. a few people plainly comment, ""it works now never mind"" with no response or explanation which leaves me questioning if they fixed anything at all. looks like i am going to have to pass on this title and more on to more stable products. for those it worked for, lucky for you and enjoy the game i think it looks great but it just wont work for my machine. "
,madethis,2011-03-30T07:50Z,"Hey JimmyHat408, I was having the exact same problem you were. What ended up working for me was that I was trying to open a copy that was on my desktop, i was frustrated and dragging all the copies to the trash to delete them, but when all but the one in my actual applications folder was gone, I tried opening that one and it finally worked. So my advice is make the only copy you have the one in the applications folder, and try to open that. 

Hopefully it works for you too."
,JimmyHat408,2011-03-30T10:40Z,"@madethis
I did come across that suggestion as well but I thought that it was so insignificant I would not even waste my time to try it out since no other game needed to be in the apps folder. I will give that a try and I hope it works out, I love games that shake up the normal line up such as machinarium which I tried and eventually bought. So if this works than thanks in advance and i apologize for my ignorance, I would consider myself a vet of TPB and usually sit and laugh at the type of comments  made lol"
,JimmyHat408,2011-03-30T12:42Z,"@madethis
still no luck. i deleted again and did a clean download, i even made a new administrator account in hopes that it would let me enter a key again which it did. i installed in the application folder and received the same same error as before. like i said, i could not get the demo to work with for Mac OR PC. there must be some issue with the software IMO because both my PC and mac are more than able to handle the system requirements. if anyone has a fix for me i will re download and keep seeding but for now amnesia scheduled for de-resolution in the trash bin...

,mac_user777,2011-04-08T03:09Z,"This game had true potential but they didn't provide information as to how to move..I need  RUN key!

And I have this system MacBook5,1
  Processor Name:	Intel Core 2 Duo
  Processor Speed:	2.4 GHz 
 L2 Cache:	3 MB
  Memory:	2 GB
  Bus Speed:	1.07 GHz 

And its choppy at best on medium def(low definition jst looks crap), I'm going to give up, i found picking things up damn near impossible general gameplay frustrating with the controls set they way they are. I'm sure the game great and all but I demand a game that doesn't piss you off from the beginning trying to figure out the key controls,and it should show you in the menu, and it doesn't!Very annoying however  not your fault KawMoc thanks for the upload.

This seems a bit like a poor mans Doom 3,could someone upload a decent working version of that,I  really miss Doom 3 and I could get it working on bootcamp PC windows,not a native mac version."
,daftjustice,2011-04-26T22:10Z,serial no.?
,JimmyHat408,2011-05-29T04:53Z,"@daftjustice the serials are in the torrent file. good luck, i could not get it to work and my machine is more than capable to run this with full settings."

,MickiSel,2011-06-23T16:56Z,"It works great, most of the time, but I'm suffering from frequent freezes and crashes. Sometimes the whole image freeze, but I still can hear music, and sometimes it just quits, and I get a message saying ""Amnesia quit unexpedtedly"".

When you're in Storage, after being in the Back Hall, you're supposed to make explosives, and blow away that debris of rocks and shit, blocking the passage to the ""Machine Parts"" section. I've made the explosive mixture, but I can't place it! Nowhere to place the glowing red mixture, and I don't know what to do. 

Anyone got a solution? I heard it had something to do about the 1.0.1 patch breaking something vital. What version is this, @KawMoc?"
