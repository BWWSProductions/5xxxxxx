A:10
V:9.5

Overall I would say that this torrent is worth the download.  Low file size makes it a great choice!"

,stickman1000000,2010-11-21T03:18Z,on the episode partial terms of endearment the sound gets cut out in the middle of the episode. other than that its all good
,bollotoral,2012-06-23T20:09Z,"the sound has some noise, not very good quality.

People is already used to the 175mb size of the avi files for a tv show, why not make a 175mb rip in mkv or mp4 and improve the quality?!"
