The saddest part about this ""there is no world government and one is not coming"" is we've had one since WW2. I mean, what does it mean when we have a United Nations, World Health Organization, World Trade Organization and court, World Bank, Bank of International Settlements, International Monetary Fund, G-8, G-20, Law of the Sea Treaty, Global Copyright Accord, Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), Cap and Trade and ""Climate Change"" treaties (which setup global taxes and enforcers)? (I am sure there are more I could list.) That is administrative and judicial world government. The only thing missing is something to pose as the peoples' voice/vote (which, even if it appears, will be a joke)."
