This is a release of the Castlevania I (1987),II (1988), and III (1990) NES Games Soundtracks at: 105MB
This release contains:
All songs are from the three classic Castlevania video games. The songs were taken for the album: AkumajÅ Dracula Best Vol. 1 1998. I normalized the audio to a level of 98 percent on all the songs, getting the best audio gain possible. Then I saved them in Mp3 format, 320 Kbps, 44100Hz Stereo (4.4.1) They now sound incredible! The songs from Castlevania III Draculas Curse from Akumajo Dracula Bet Vol. I while the exact songs from the game featured sound effect interludes between game tracks. These sounds effects were not part of the original soundtrack so I edited them out. The three Castlevania soundtracks in this release are ONLY the songs from the games, as they sound in the games, not remixed versions, and now Remastered to be enjoyed!
