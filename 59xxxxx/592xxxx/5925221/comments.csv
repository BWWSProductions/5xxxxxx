,MHFO,2010-11-01T17:55Z,Thank you! The best TV SHOW ever!
,Hellcattt,2010-11-01T19:15Z,Good video quality. Thanks to honeybunny for providing subtitles! 
,gamer-9955,2010-11-01T20:02Z,Should I read the comics or watch the show? I don't want to do both because they're basically the same story. What's your suggestion?
,ntongh2o,2010-11-01T20:36Z,"@gamer-9955
So far, the TV show is 90% true to the comic so if you're feeling lazy, then watch the show."
,heyman1981,2010-11-01T21:18Z,This show is the SHIT!! :) thanks
,wtfronsson,2010-11-02T21:35Z,"Finally an american tv-show I can watch without puking. Very nice action, gore, even drama doesn't seem out of place like it usually does when theres zombies involved. Im definetily buying the dvd-box(es) once they start selling.

Funny its rated 14 with so much blood and violence :P"
,crest401jbc,2010-11-02T23:17Z,what's funny is how people kill torrents from good uppers.....Plz seed!!!!
,crest401jbc,2010-11-02T23:19Z,I'm getting 300kb/s when I usually get 2Mb/s!!
,Sirez,2010-11-04T02:48Z,"Wow...some of you bemuse me (and not in a good way)...maybe you shouldnt be downloading torrents at all considering your ISP may now have you capped...theres no reason other than that, that you shouldnt be downloading at your highest bandwidth with that many seeders..."
,thepiratejary,2010-11-04T04:59Z,"Thank you for uploading, its a very good one :)"
,skullniac8,2010-11-04T15:18Z,Hey gamer-9955 u should definately read the comic!the artwork is awesome and the characters are deep.Everyone is sooo hooked on it and u can download all issues.It realy worth it cause there arent many as good comics as this nowdays.
,skullniac8,2010-11-04T20:18Z,By the way many thanks for the up VTV appreciated!Great episode nice guality too!
,Hardlydan1,2010-11-06T02:08Z,"Quit bitching about the speed and count yourself luck... With my connection I have to be happy with ""its done when its done"". It is after all free and your life won't end if you don't see it right now. Hell I'm working on an 80GB download now, 86% in and still 2 weeks to go!"
,Hardlydan1,2010-11-06T02:12Z,*lucky
,r0ttiem0m,2010-11-06T08:39Z,Thanks for this new show - its really great.
,Quad-K,2010-11-08T10:31Z,"Woah, actually a decent series (almost movie like) with some real emotion and not just some ""hey lets go shot some fucking zombies"" crap. Great Upload.

A/V: 9"
,hurka79,2010-11-08T23:08Z,Thanks from Hungary!
,StayWay,2010-11-09T01:58Z,Awesomeness!!!!!!
,mershcakes,2010-11-09T16:39Z,"I'm loving this show so far its freakin awesome.

But I wish for once a zombie movie/tv would actually show the outbreak of the zombie apocalypse not just start out with a dude in the hospital waking up and nobody there etc. its been done to many times"
,aapb,2010-11-10T01:05Z,"I can't say I've ever been a mega fan of Zombie movies and such.  perhaps it's my lack of knoweldge but whatever.. I found this to be extremly exciting and it totally sucked me in altho I haven't read the comics. This is not some B-production. Kind of like a serious version of Zombieland altho this one is a series. anyways, thanks for this!"
,beestripe,2011-01-21T21:54Z,"Yeah, it's well done in it's own respect, but I'm not hooked, I've watched ep2 aswell and it's clear that the plot is thin and predictable.

Must say though, if you like cheesy blood and gore en-mass, don't listen to me...  "
,dkhere,2011-02-02T01:29Z,Thanks for the upload and thanks for the subtitles: @honeybunny
,abovetheashes,2011-11-01T21:07Z,what a great show!!
