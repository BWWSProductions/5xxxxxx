mkv is just a container file for the files in the listed codecs.

i think..."

to start with you.
mkv is not a format but a container for files
as u can see the formats for video are X264 (sigh crappy quality)
And for audio Flac (yay lossless audio) 
so even if it says 1080p, because of the X264format its nothing better than a uncompressed dvd rip"

Or maybe the year 2050? Where they have a new codec that leaves x264 in the dust? No better then ""uncompressed"" dvdrip? Trolling ftw."
