BBC A History of Horror 2of3 PDTV x264 AAC MVGroup 2010

Series in which Mark Gatiss celebrates the greatest achievements of horror cinema. 

Part 2: Home Counties Horror.
Mark Gatiss continues his celebration of horror cinema by uncovering the stories behind the films of his favourite period, the 1950s and 60s, an era dominated by Hammer Films, who rewrote the horror rulebook with an infusion of sex and full-colour gore - all shot in the English Home Counties. Mark meets key Hammer figures to find out why their films conquered the world, looks at the new boom of horror that followed in Hammer's wake and explores the cycle of British 'folk horror' films such as The Wicker Man.
