Now do you have #246?

And may I please ask that you enter the full title as ""Fansadox Collection"" so that the search function will find the correct thread, and not as ""FC"", as you did  for # 248 which ends up not being listed during a search for ""Fansadox*"" or ""Fansadox"" because the search engine is looking for ""Fansadox"".  Thank you.

Thanks for the url to the comics collection.

My collection is complete as of your last post, then.

Thank you very much.
