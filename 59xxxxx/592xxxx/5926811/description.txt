MANOJ COMICS (HINDI) RAM-RAHIM SET-04

Ram-Rahim was the first and most popular characters to appear on Manoj Comics, 
a popular comics strip in India. Ram and Rahim were two different characters 
playing role of secret agents.
In most of the stories their job will be to save the world from a wicked scientist
or an enemy of their nation. A typical story will feature their mission to bring 
back a stolen secret file from the villain's den, before it reaches the enemy nation.
The choice of character's name as Ram and Rahim was also contributing towards religious
harmony among children. According to one volume namely Vatann ke Dushman Rahim is 
the son of a Pakistani colonel who defected to India after he got disillusioned by 
fanaticism of Pakistani armed forces, especially an officer named Fanneh Khan. 
Ram is the eldest son of a highly placed Indian Intelligence beaurecrat.
Ram is a Hindu name while Rahim is a Muslim name. Both will have tremendous friendship 
and both will work together to save the world.
They have a enemy named Dr. Fomanchu.
In later stories, Rahim loses his one hand and has to make do with a prosthetic arm 
that has the same capabilities as a normal hand, but much stronger and faster.
Children used to wait for summer holidays in the late 80s and early 90s for special 
editions of Ram-Rahim's and Crookbond's comics during summer holidays.
