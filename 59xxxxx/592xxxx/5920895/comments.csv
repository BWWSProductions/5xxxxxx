How can this be available before it is even over?

I know TvTeam is legit, so I'm not accusing this of being fake, I'm just confused how it can be up before the live show is finished airing???"

I canceled my cable a year and a half ago, when it was still on at 11pm."

Maher was on CNN today trying to say it wasn't a real joint, but you can tell by the reaction of the woman Zach passes it to that it was real. awesome show, thanks for the UP!!"
