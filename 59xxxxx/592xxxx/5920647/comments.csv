,khesed,2010-10-30T05:06Z,I will wait for the re-play (which should be monday) and the re-up if you're having this problem. Thanks for being one of the few LEGITIMATE hosts of this episode.

,khesed,2010-10-31T23:23Z,"eh, i'll take what i can get. If it's bad, i'll wait up on hosting it to youtube."
,khesed,2010-11-01T00:03Z,"i'm hosting the episode to youtube. Your audio glitch issue wasn't horrible, but i'll note in the description if an issue pops up. Channel name's same as my TPB user."
