Amazon.co.uk Review
The film career of Guy Ritchie has endured a few bumps in recent years, with a collection of generally forgettable films from a man clearly capable of so much more. Thank goodness then for RocknRolla, which marks a smashing return to form, as he heads once more to the criminal underworld of London.

This time, Ritchie is playing far closer to the likes of Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and while RocknRolla may see the director playing on safer ground than of late, it doesnâ€™t take long for the decision to be vindicated. The plot surrounds a real-estate job with millions at stake, and it gives ample excuse to unleash a collection of raw gangsters and tough guys into the mix, who each fancy a bit of the action.

Thus, RocknRolla brings together Gerard Butlerâ€™s Scottish gangster, Tom Wilkinsonâ€™s London crime lord, Toby Kebbellâ€™s drug-addicted musician and the likes of Thandie Newton, Mark Strong and Jeremy Piven too. And Ritchieâ€™s cast serve him really well, making ample mileage out of the lines theyâ€™re given.

Granted, all of this is hardly fresh territory for the director, but RocknRolla is nonetheless funny, action-packed and a good British mob film to while away an evening with. Welcome back, Mr Ritchieâ€¦ --Jon Foster
