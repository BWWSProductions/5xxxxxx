P.S.: Had strange problem with this one - some dialog boxes and buttons appeared empty, with no text in 'em. So i had to disable my last plugin, which i hadn't expected to affect games THAT much. And it was macrofire.prx. I don't know if this particular plugin is the problem itself, maybe this game is just allergic to any plugins. So if having problems remember to try and disable your game-plugins and see how it goes. Good luck playing.
