,BrokenBottles,2010-10-30T19:47Z,Thanks SAFCuk! Finally a version with hardcoded subs only for the non-english speaking parts. 
,Garcia23,2010-10-30T23:14Z,Anyone else having problems downloading? Im not getting any seeders
,Tinny_pb,2010-11-02T08:14Z,"This is a 2.5 hour movie, so the video quality at 1GiB is comparable to those 700MiB rips of shorter movies. It lacks sharpness but it's perfectly clear. Gets a +1 from me. A7, V8.

Thanks, SAFCukO09."
