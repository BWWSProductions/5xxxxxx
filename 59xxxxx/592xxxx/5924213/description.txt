NOTES!

OK in this one i use Russian version wich i work a little bit on the source and set brightness, colors & contrast..i adjust the AR for a beter view.
..the audio source it`s from TDX release many thx for that, wich i work`it a little bit on the sound & increase the volume...
Since the audio source had only 1h 22min and video source had 1h 24min,
i cut the first 2 min from video. . . so take it or leave it.
Works with all DVD Players and Compatible > PS3 & XBOX 360.
