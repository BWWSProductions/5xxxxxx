Greatest Hits and Greatest Hits - Ultimate Collection are compilation albums released October 29, 2010 by rock band Bon Jovi. Greatest Hits is a single disc, spanning the entire career of the band as well as two new songs, including a new single, "What Do You Got?", and "No Apologies". Greatest Hits - The Ultimate Collection is a double disc collection featuring the Greatest Hits album and another disc featuring fan favorites along with two more new songs: "This Is Love, This Is Life" and "The More Things Change". The four new songs were written specifically for this new compilation project. The font used for the band's name on the album's cover is a return to the Bon Jovi logo used from 1985 to 1988.Twelve songs from the Greatest Hits album will also later be released as downloadable content for music video game series Rock Band (somewhere around, or after, the release of Rock Band 3).
