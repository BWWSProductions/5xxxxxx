what makes you think it is a fake torrent.

i worked hard on this and this uploader is one of the trusted people i let upload here."
,Notor1ous,2010-11-29T15:37Z,It not fake. it is however a pretty sick movie... As in Sickening.
,hihee,2010-12-10T22:25Z,"sorry, someone may have done a lot of work on this but it doesn't run smoothly.  It pixilates and stops and gets stuck with vlc.  windows media says it can't play it.  what are you supposed to play it with.? 2.8 gigs is a little large for a movie file."
,hettinger,2011-04-01T04:18Z,"A full quality hd video won't play on a crappy computer, works fine with my VLC.  Definitely a real torrent w/o viruses."

,Dirge656,2011-12-25T08:56Z,"hihee, it sounds like you've been watching crap dvdrips at 700mbs. 2.82 gigs is small for a movie file. But, i trust icebane releases for overall quality"
