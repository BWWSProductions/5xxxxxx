,bradass,2011-05-30T19:17Z,"aspect ratio
720 fits full screen
544 has bars on top and bottom.

am i right on that?"
,Swirl78,2011-06-01T08:42Z,"720 version has ""bars"" too. 544 version simply skips encoding them in order to reduce file size. Image size on screen is the same in either case."

,Philonetic,2011-06-05T22:36Z,"There have been 2 GOOD X-Men First Class Torrents uploaded and then deleted by TPB, one was from .BONE..  WTF TPB?  Since when did TPB start taking down good torrents?  This site has been SHIT the last few months.  Whats the deal?"
,creek75,2011-06-13T21:32Z,"Nice!! Many thanks - the next bit is for clients of the MPAA...

... to all marketing idiots - a sequence of four works is called a tetralogy. There is no such thing as a quadrilogy (compound of quad and trilogy) or quadrology (compound of quad and 'I think I understand Latin when actually I was thinking of Greek')
Here endeth the lesson."
