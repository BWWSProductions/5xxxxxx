Meat Loaf live at the Beacon Theater in New York from October 23rd,1995 is a great concert. Sound and video are superb and the setlist is also entertaining. This is a well known tv concert but also a must have. I added three songs to the concert to make it a more complete setlist. I hope you enjoy this great dvd!
