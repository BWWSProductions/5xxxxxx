Joan Jett - Bad Reputation [promo].VOB



Very HQ rare promo music video. "Bad Reputation" is a rock song 
performed by Joan Jett and first released on her debut album titled 
Joan Jett in 1980. In 2009 it was named the 29th best hard rock song 
of all time by VH1. The highest song by a female on the list. 

This video, directed by David Mallet, is a re-enactment of 23 record 
labels rejecting Joan Jett's first solo album and her subsequent rise to 
the top of the charts with "I Love Rock 'n Roll". Kenny Laguna, cofounder 
of Blackheart Records, makes a cameo as the Warner Brothers executive.
