Osmos for linux from Hemisphere games(32 & 64 bits)
===================================================

Enter the ambient world of Osmos: elegant, physics-based gameplay, dreamlike visuals, and a minimalist, electronic soundtrack.
Your objective is to grow by absorbing other motes.
Propel yourself by ejecting matter behind you.
But be wise: ejecting matter also shrinks you.
RelaxÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Âª good things come to those who wait.
Progress from serenely ambient levels into varied and challenging worlds.
Confront attractors, repulsors and intelligent motes with similar abilities and goals as you.
