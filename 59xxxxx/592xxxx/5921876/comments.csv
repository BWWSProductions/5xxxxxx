I have never had a bad experience, as I am not some hoity toity audiophile.  The built in speakers are good enough for me....until now.  How can this be a DVD Rip???  Seriously... Video I would rate a 10... audio.. a fucking 3 or 4 out of 10....

It sounds as if there is a buzzing low bass tone over every single thing.  Now... I disclosed that I am watching this on a shitty Insignia TV.. but this has to be the worst audio for a DVD Rip I have EVER downloaded.  Maybe it is my shitty LCD TV.... but I haven't had a problem.. seriously... audio, to me, sounds like a shitty CAM.  

Just me?

From what I read from these comments is that some of you are not for sure on the ending.  Basically, he performs Inception upon himself to make him believe he made it out of the operation successful to see his children again, when in fact he is still in a dream. The operation was a success, but Cobb never made it out. The entire movie is not a dream, it just ends with him stuck within his own paradise of a dream."

,giggie4,2011-01-13T23:49Z,"@ctilley_007 Well, first trolololol. Second, Inception has a deeper meaning than just ""they all make it out just fine it turns out theres layers to dreams and you can of course pull people through the layers one by one and bring them back"" because you don't actually know they all make it out because his top never stopped spinning at the end, therefore inferring that he is still in a dream. If you had better insight you would have noticed this. Third, I think you should watch the movie again without being a total whiney bitch about everything and pay attention this time."

First, this film was actually very good. One of the best films that I've seen this year. 

Second, why insult someone for no apparent reason through a little comment on TPB, where these comments are meant to be for rating the movie quality and audio quality, and for people to give their review on the film?

Thirdly, please don't reply to me. If this comment doesn't sink some sense into you, you have no hope. Troll somewhere else.

Really, really boring movie, just random silly scenes, which don't even look good, with the excuse being that those random scenes are all dreams... right... so stupid...

I loved Memento & Machinist so I had high hopes for this movie, but I honestly thought it was one of the worst movies I've tried to sit through...

It was like the writer saw Matrix - which was an awesome movie in every way - and tried to re-create it, but ended up with this really bad, unwatchable nonsense.

This is no knock to Extreme Zone - I'm sure he has done a great job uploading this movie, but the actual movie itself is just awful, really, really awful.

Bad script, but even worse execution - 

I think anyone who likes this movie just likes stupid effects and trying to figure out what was going on, thinking that ""Dreams are really deep man, when you don't know if you are dreaming or not""... erm, well that's not really clever, it's just a reason to film random stupid crap which doesn't make any sense....

Kan jag fÃ¥ er uppmÃ¤rksamhet tack! Var vÃ¤nlig lÃ¤s detta fÃ¶r allas vÃ¥ran skull, sÃ¥ vi inte

===========================================================================================


Ville tacka speciellt dÃ¥ jag vet hur de Ã¤r nÃ¤r ingen tackar fÃ¶r ens uploads, som min 

torrent, har uploaded Ã¶ver 100gb, inga seeders kvar iaf, alla sticker direkt, och ingen 

sÃ¤ger tack..

Bara fÃ¶r att det Ã¤r ""gratis"" sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver man inte vara ofÃ¶rskÃ¤md, speciellt mot de som 

anstrÃ¤nger sig och ger er dessa saker gratis!
SÃ¥ tack!
Hoppas detta kan fÃ¥ flera att fÃ¶rstÃ¥ att ett litet tack kan gÃ¶ra sÃ¥ stor skillnad..

================================= Â«Â« ENGLISH Â»Â» ==================================


Wanted to say thanks, especially when I know how it feels when no one appreciates our 

uploads, as my torrent, has uploaded over 100GB, and no seeders left anyway, everyone left 

immediately after they finished, and no one even bothered to say Thank you .. (thinking of 

stop seeding it soon, if it will not change..)

Just because it is ""free""  you do not need to be rude and such a douches, especially to 

those of us who give up our free time and put effort in to give you these things for free!
So thank you!

Hope this can get more people to understand that just a little THANK YOU! can make a big 

difference ..

Best regards!

,ravenshade,2011-04-24T22:20Z,"Strangely... and I use VLC... there was no video. o.O; I like to think of extremezone's rips being good, but I'm surprised on this one. 

I do know about selecting channels, but as there was only one channel to select from there isn't much point. (Before some geek thinks I'm an idiot). 

Anyway, that's the problem for me, perhaps I'm missing a codec or something. "
