*** FSX FSGLOBAL 2010 SP1 ***



SP1 + SCENERY FIX OF SKCL 
 

WHO NEEDS THIS SP1?
====================
You ONLY need this SP1, if you are running R1 of FS Global 2010.
If you are running a later release, you DO NOT NEED this SP1 as it is already
implemented in your version.
To determine, if you are running R1, please check the readme file on
your DVD1. If the header says \"PILOT\'S FS Global 2010 R1 for ...\" then you need
SP1. DO NOT INSTALL SP1, IF YOU RUN A LATER VERSION!
WHAT HAS BEEN FIXED?
=====================
Due to the nature of SRTM in flat areas high buildings can be mistaken for a hill. It is
impossible to solve this issue by reworking data using a special algorithm. We
therefore decided to switch data sources for North America. Instead of SRTM we will
be using alternative data in future versions. SP1 addresses obvious issues in the
area of Florida.
