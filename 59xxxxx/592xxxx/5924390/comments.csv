Could you pls encode ET The extra-terrestrial?
"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-31T20:19Z,"@DMVIN: For some reason, unknown to human kind, all torrents are dead and all direct links too. Of course, I would do HDTV rip, next week."
,ritesh89,2010-10-31T21:30Z,hey 20-40.. would u upload smallville seasons????
,Mkls,2010-11-01T00:35Z,"First of all, thanks for your releases 20-40, I just discovered your torrents, and I love them. I don't understand why others don't use h264 for smaller size releases.

I have one suggestion though. I realize you don't release whole seasons of any TV show, but I think it would be really useful for many reasons:

- Most of your older, single episode releases are almost dead. If you release a whole season it would probably live on its on.
For example I was trying to get all the episodes of Justified in your 272p h264 format, but I couldn't find them all, and some of them are dead. If a season 1 torrent existed, I wouldn't just download it, but I would help to seed to others, while in the case of single episodes, there is no one to seed to.

- Smaller file sizes are especially useful when downloading a whole season. Most people only realize how much bandwidth and HDD capacity is needed for the usual 350mb files, when they see the whole season together. Just look at the popularity of some (Xvid asd) releases.

I know you probably have your own reasons not to do this, but I hope you will reconsider.

So if you decide for example to release Justified Season 1 in 272p h264 format, I would be happy to help with seeding, since I have a connection I don't use to its full potential. (I already have all the episodes, so its not a fully selfish request).

I hope my English isn't too messed up, and I didn't waste too much of your time.

,htctouch,2010-11-01T07:30Z,"hello sir .. i have a request .. 

can u plz do this movie DUMMY http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246592/

waiting for ur reply"
,Fangular,2010-11-01T08:08Z,"Hi 2040.. am just asking (not requesting, as such!) whether you're intending to upload The Walking Dead?

Cheers!"
,DMVIN,2010-11-01T08:34Z,"Thanks for considering my request.
I eagerly wait for the HDTV rip."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-01T09:18Z,"@ALL: NO, I can't upload season packs of any show because I have 54 kB/s UL speed (from my home, where all encodes are) any better than I did so far - when I can, when I have not other things to upload - what happens almost - never.

@htctouch: Even if that movie is good, I'll search for direct links and send'em in e-mail to you. If ones could be found.

@skillet92: Early cuts are kind of - nothing. Mish-mash of webisodes and lamentations. Maybe for over the top fans of Dexter.

@Mkls: Your language is clear and everything you've said was considered during all these years. Some things popped up empirically, some were carved in painful and long process.
"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-01T09:19Z,"@nemesis160: Both DVDSCR so far have been downloaded and - deleted, almost immediately.

@strmprpl: For a third time: only first four episodes have English subs. German dubbed series exist and name of the pack was given. Google. Portuguese and Spanish dubs can be found too. What I intended to encode, has been done. Despicable me would be done when something decent pops out.
"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-01T09:23Z,@Fangular: Today I would encode HDTV official airing and it would be in TV pack today.
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-01T09:25Z,"@ALL: Look please, thoroughly, TV packs - many sound disoriented. Bookmark my ""home"" as advised. Learn how to use search both here and on Google (for instance, use of ""+"" character between the terms)."
,skillet92,2010-11-01T09:38Z,"@20-40!
So will u consider doing the early cuts...if u do...take your time...i am no hurry.!! 

Thanks!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-01T09:55Z,"Nope skillet, I thought it was evident."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-01T10:09Z,"@Mkls: Idiots always screw up for the good people. I was called MOTHERFUCKER many times on my Justified uploads. Just because some mentaly ill people found quality as bad, ugly, and worse for their sensitive and trained eyes. First, I try to ignore that, and if repeats, I skip next week, then I simply stop to care - as happened with Justified, Damages, Leverage, Lost and many many more TV shows.
I guess that qualifies me for bad person who would burn in hell. It happens whenever last remain normal people get over-run by stupid majority."
,saurabh1992,2010-11-01T10:14Z,"hey man can u upload 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'

Give this poor guy a break.He is overworked as it is."
,redriding,2010-11-01T16:29Z,"@twentyforty:Thank you so much for all the hard work and extra effort. It really is appreciated. And having TV packs is a awesome idea.

Thanks again.

@requesters... stop asking for stuff, just take what he puts out in a week, and get your fix from the rest of the uploaders on piratebay. Give the man some rest. Oh and demanding sh!t is not on... you should and will be ignored."
