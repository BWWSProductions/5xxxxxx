Another solid album, I am truly surprised at how well the easy listening/swing element works in some of the songs. I really like Tabor with pianos, it somehow always makes her music seem darker than it already is. Some really scornful and intense songs, but there is a really nice standout song called "The Cloud Factory" about a girl who has a dreamer for a father and a very grounded, miserable mother.
