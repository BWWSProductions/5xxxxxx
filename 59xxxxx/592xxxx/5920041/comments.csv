Can enyone tell how to make it work in FSX..and witch foler to add ?"
,pumpernickel,2010-10-30T15:53Z,"@woody1954
Just execute the .exe. In addition I had to add the new scenery manually - either within FSX (Settings, Scenery Library, sometimes in W7 64 a bit tricky) or with an Editor the file scenery.cfg. Thats all."

What exactly do you want to know? How to find and edit the file scenery.cfg or how to add a new scenery within FSX?"
,sinsnowman,2010-11-04T13:19Z,Is there an fs2004 version? Can't find it~~
,SARmedic,2010-11-06T15:42Z,"Nice upload but I can't get it to work quite right.

The buildings show up after adding the scenery libraries in-game, but there are no textures on them and I can't figure out how to get them working.

Win7/64bit"
