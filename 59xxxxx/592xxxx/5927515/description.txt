
When an act called Sisters Love were offered a cameo in the blaxploitation film The Mack, their manager suggested that Willie Hutch do the soundtrack. 
It came to be one of the great '70s film scores, including a pair of classic funk tunes, "Brothers Gonna Work It Out" and the title cut. 
The results proved to be another soundtrack that far surpassed the quality of its film. (AMG)




On THE MACK, the soundtrack to to the cult film starring Max Julien, Roger Mosley (pre- "Magnum P.I.") and Richard Pryor, 70s Motown artist Willie Hutch dazzles with his "Bobby Womack meets Bill Withers" vocals, earthy lyrics, southern soul-style guitar picking and excellent string and horn arrangements. 

The two singles from this album ("Brother's Gonna Work It Out" and "Slick) became top 20 r&b hits, while the respectably sexy "I Choose You" was a popular black radio album cut. Other highlights from this set include the mournful "Mama's Song", the wistful "Now That It's All Over" and the pumpin' title track. 

Like most blaxploitation soundtracks of the 70's, THE MACK features wah-wah guitars and sooperbaaad "chick" background singers. However, these cliches actually enhance these thought-provoking songs. Overall, THE MACK is like Curtis Mayfield's SUPERFLY. Both soundtracks have seven songs and two instrumentals as well as lyrics that act as a Greek chorus to warn the listeners about the dangers of street life. (Customer from Amazon)
