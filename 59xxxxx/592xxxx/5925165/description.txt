Full version of Maple 14 for MAC OSX.

Zip File contains crack folder (with instructions), and another zip file with the installer contained. Straightforward installation. Select \"single user license\" and then \"activate later\" when prompted.

This may work for Linux PC\'s but I am not sure. Maybe someone can try, and post on here if it works.

Cheers!
