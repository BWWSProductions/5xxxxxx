,Stultissimi_Amatorii,2010-10-31T06:19Z,"I recently visited the Fredericton Public Library and starting looking through the CDs at their ongoing book sale. I bought 33 for $33, several of which had formerly belonged to the Harvest Jazz & Blues Festival. Only two of the CDs were by bands or singers I`ve ever heard of, but I`ved found some real gems in the third of them I`ve listened to so far. Support your local library, folks, they`re wondrous places most of us take for granted.


This particular CD threw an error when I tried to play it in my stereo, but the copy I made played perfectly. Go figure.
