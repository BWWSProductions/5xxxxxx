I then write the script for the dll.xml I've tried MindstarHypergauge,Mindstar Hyperguage. I've also copied over from txt and hand typed it. Still no displays. The Fms and everything work fine just no display:( Please help. Win7 64 bit"

,jb42682,2010-11-02T03:11Z,I put it as the very last. I even tryed it at the very bottom. What's the differance from the one before? I followed the format of the orignal file dll.xml with supplied script. something's missing and or glitch. Should dcrack overwrite in gauges? Look at number of comments when post it helps. Fly's great no display.

,jb42682,2010-11-02T09:22Z,Also. I know this isn't on you but you wouldn't have any idea why i'm loosing all power mid flight? And yes my gen's on 23.5v to both engines. Temp drops as climb then rises rapidly and it then it all goes black and won't let me turn the battery back on.
,Just_Ask,2010-11-05T02:03Z,on my works fine whitout problem 
,jb42682,2010-11-06T22:25Z,"I don't know what it is. I've tried leaving the apu running,Leaving off pitot static heat,xtie on/off. Followed the checklist to the letter. It almost seems timed it shuts down the same way everytime no warning just the bat temp rising. It's even happend on the ground and won't let run external our any battery.
Maybe fsx version. I'm running fsx sp2 no accel on win7 64. I wish I could figure out what's going on. They won't let me in dev forums lol."
,acropilot,2010-11-09T12:43Z,"Thanks.

,derda2,2010-11-21T10:58Z,"doesn't work. why? unzipped into program files and copied as told all into d:\FSX

,derda2,2010-11-21T20:01Z,anyone got this working with Vista?
,Wallboy19,2010-12-18T07:20Z,"Hmm thought this was a different version then DCracks, I was having the same problem with the plane just completely shutting off in climb or cruise."
,el_kab0ng,2011-03-30T06:35Z,Apparently the CX750 has a time limit due to a license file check (30 minutes). Dcrack claimed it was something to do with esftchk5.dll but never explained how to adjust it to remove the time limit.
,BlacJac,2011-04-06T01:46Z,thanks!!!   Request Wilco Tower! 2011
