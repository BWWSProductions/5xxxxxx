Episode

2: ALONG THE AFRICAN RIFT
In the second episode of Geologic Journey: II, Along the Rift, we reveal how the earthâ€™s crust is ripping apart, as molten rock from deep within its recesses pushes upwards. For millions of years the East African Rift has been widening at the seams, tearing the African plate in two.  Weâ€™ll first visit prehistoric sites in Kenya, not far from the so-called â€œcradle of humanity.â€

Along the Rift will reveal that we are truly creatures conceived by plate tectonics. We'll visit Ethiopia's Afar Triangle, where the Earth is fundamentally re-ordering its surface, and journey to Egypt's Nile valley, which has been a corridor of trade and a cradle of civilizations for centuries.

On the final leg of the journey, we'll witness how the tectonic violence of the Dead Sea Rift has punctuated the history of human habitation and culture â€“ in fact, entire cities have been abandoned after apocalyptic earthquakes. The seismic threat hangs over the area like a curse.

About The Series
Geologic Journey II will change the way you look at the world. In each episode, we dive straight into the Earth's mysterious geologic processes â€“ and explore both science and legend as we seek to understand and explain the geologic forces that shape our world, and our lives. With Dr. Nick Eyles of the University of Toronto Scarborough as our guide, this five-part documentary series will reveal the Earth's magnificent power and its breathtaking beauty.

Geologic Journey II takes us to some of our planet's most dangerous and dynamic places, and helps explain how they got that way. From some of the highest mountaintops to the lowest salt plains, and from the center of violent volcanoes to the deep trenches beneath the ocean floor, Geologic Journey II travels with some of the world's most outstanding geologists as they decipher the mysteries of the earth's evolution.

Combining stunning HD pictures and beautiful aerial photography, this series gives the audiences a connection to their surroundings like never before.
