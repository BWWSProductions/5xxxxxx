,nippie221,2011-01-20T20:56Z,"The game does not work it's riddled with virus's,  it DOES steal you information my pc was working fine till i tried to install this so called game, my anti virus informed me of keylogging activity.  iI believe ths guy has opened different account as so to give positive feedback.  I can assure everyone that attempts to download this game it IS a virus and spyware.  Don't download!!"
,dragontile,2011-01-21T10:21Z,"Nippie221 is right! the game does not work and i believe that muppet Joekker is opening more piratebay accounts to give himself positive feedback, well i thing the moron is sad......

It's not a game, as soon as you click on the first file my router went crazy i couldn't get to any sites after that, obviously my pc was being scanned i unplugged the router but the damage was already done,  Previous fifa manager games NEVER EVER asked you to restart you pc and this did, the page that asked me to restart was of poor design, EA sports wouldn't have had such a cheap looking notification.
