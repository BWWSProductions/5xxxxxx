The Scriptures were banned, burned, and ridiculed by rulers of every age, from Roman emperors to English monarchs. Many who dared to read and share the Word met horrible deaths. Yet God's truth could not be crushed. This four-volume video commentary by Ken Connolly is a spectacular sweep of history, filmed on location in Israel, Europe, Britain, and the U.S.

Retrace the Historic Path of God's Word from Mt. Sinai to Plymouth Rock. Meet the scholars, teachers, and missionaries whose passionate faith preserved the Indestructible Book.

From the ancient deserts of Israel to the shores of the New World, The Indestructible Book documents an incredible story of faith and sacrifice. This commentary by Bible scholar Ken Connolly tells of believers inspired by God to protect the Bible and carry its message of hope and salvation forward through the centuries. The Scriptures were banned, burned, and ridiculed by rulers of every age, from Roman emperors to English monarchs. Many who dared to read and share the Word met appalling deaths. Yet God's truth could not be crushed. The greatest worldly powers were no match for the mission of the apostles, crusaders, translators, reformers, preachers and printers dedicated to spreading the Gospel of The Indestructible Book. Filmed on location in Israel, Europe, Britain and the U.S., The Indestructible Book captures the spectacular sweep of history with visual images as rich and varied as the story it unfolds. This digitally re-mastered two-disc set includes all four original VHS volumes, hosted by Ken Connolly.
