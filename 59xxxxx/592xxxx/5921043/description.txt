          - AI opponents enabled                                            
                                                                            
          - Added handling for if firewall is turned off                    
                                                                            
          - Added check for if player is disconnected before starting       
           turn timer when the end turn is requested                        
                                                                            
          - Added check to prevent player from going to multiplayer menu    
           if it's still checking for an update

          - AI sovereigns take more care about where they are doing         
            their attacking                                                 
                                                                            
          - Added code so that AIBasic is smarter about attacking units     
            in cities                                                       
                                                                            
          - "Equipment Cache" goodie hut now hands out cloth armor,         
            instead of the patchwork armor that should not be in the        
            game anymore                                                    
                                                                            
          - You can no longer train groups of Dragons, Catapults, or        
            Giant Demons                                                    
                                                                            
          - New option: Players can choose not to have monsters spawn       
                                                                            
          - New option: Players can disable minor factions                  
                                                                            
          - Loot given by monsters increased                                
                                                                            
          - Fixed bug where some AI-controlled caravans that had already    
            established trade routes would wander off those routes while    
            delivering their stuff at a city                                
                                                                            
          - Fixed a bug where caravan pathfinding through territory         
            owned by anyone other than their owner would still have a       
            penalty, even through caravans can always move freely           
            through any territory                                           
                                                                            
          - Changed dynasty kids to determine their essence based on the    
            BASE essence of their parents (ignoring equipment, player       
            ability bonuses, etc.) This should keep kids from double-       
            dipping from things like player-wide essence bonuses and        
            keep their max mana at more reasonable levels                   
                                                                            
          - fixed several armor and special ability xml issues (that        
            were either pointed out on the forums or that I discovered      
            while fixing others)

          ***********                                                       
                                                                            
          - The starting side in a tactical battle is now chosen            
            randomly. The attacker and the defender have an equal chance    
            to go first.                                                    
                                                                            
          - Added shorter/faster annimations for bow attacks and spell      
            attacks                                                         
                                                                            
          - Fixed a divide by zero error in spell damage.                   
                                                                            
          - Fixed some logic to determine whether or not a tactical unit    
            was moving.                                                     
                                                                            
          - Added code to make sure a unit cancels its destination when     
            it skips a turn.                                                
                                                                            
          - Added some additional checks to skip turn logic in tacatical    
            battles to stop a turn from being skipped in the middle of      
            other actions.                                                  
                                                                            
          - Fix to be sure ranged attacks don't always do max damage in     
            tactical battles.                                               
                                                                            
          - Fix to experience display for battles, and fixed a bug where    
            auto resolve was only rewarding experience for killing the      
            leader unit.                                                    
                                                                            
          - The AI does not take its first turn immediately after the       
            window loads. This will prevent cases where the AI takes its    
            turn before the window finishes rendering.                      
                                                                            
          - Fixed a spell type tag for Quicken (now shows up in Tactical    
            Battles)                                                        
                                                                            
          - Fixed an issue where a single unit might lose its mana after    
            attacking and killing a defending team.                         
                                                                            
          - Added the UsableInBattle tag for item types, will help to       
            determine if an item should be displayed during a tactical      
            battle. This defaults to FALSE.                                 
                                                                            
          - Items in a tactical battle will now properly stack in the       
            UI.

          - NEW! City List window which can be brought up via a tab on      
            the kingdom screen                                              
                                                                            
          - this will list all your current cities, along with vital        
            information about resource, training, and building being        
            done there (ie: it's a city spreadsheet)                        
                                                                            
          - New icons hooked up for sovereign talents                       
                                                                            
          - Got rid of trailing decimal zeros for the global resource       
            pool tooltips, to clean up the display of resources that are    
            always integers                                                 
                                                                            
          - Fixed bug where the global resources for a player didn't        
            refresh when a city was lost through razing until the next      
            turn                                                            
                                                                            
          - Tweaked the spell info card to get the stats to show up in      
            the grey bar at the bottom of the info card, and to support     
            multiple text entries of varying sizes                          
                                                                            
          - Item Shop now shows change in Combat Speed, Defense, and        
            Attack for the highlighted item

          - Moved code around that calls clean-up functions so that we      
            don't get false mem-leak messages anymore

          - Fixed big leak in DecalGraphicGraphicManager where every        
            decal in the game was leaking when starting a new game          
            within a game                                                   
                                                                            
          - Fixed leak in CUnitSceneViewWindow (which is used on lots of    
            screens)

          - Tile Designs now flush out the graphics for their "base         
            graphic" (the one that the graphic instances use to render)     
            once the instances for that base graphic are released

          - Hooked up renaming cities and units to use events (for MP)      
                                                                            
          - Fixed bug where you could go into the enchants tab for any      
            unit and cancel their enchantments, whether that unit           
            belonged to you or not

          - Added support for Resource modifier types in unit ability       
            bonus options to be taken into account in what resources a      
            unit always provides, without needing to be stationed in a      
            city                                                            
                                                                            
          - Fixed Bug When reload a game with Wild Shard Improvements,      
            the game now properly relinks them to their resource hoards     
            (fixed issue where destroyed shrines would not regenerate       
            shard resource)

            scale properly                                                  
                                                                            
          - CalculateAbilities now uses champions for ability modifiers     
            (this fixes NPCs that should give bonuses but didn't, such      
            as "Royalty")                                                   
                                                                            
          - Fixed bug where the NPC AI player would spawn new NPCs based    
            off of the unit types of dynasty kids. This would cause         
            champions wandering around with the same name, and with baby    
            portraits if they hadn't grown up yet.

          - hooked up the cursor to change to the crossed swords at the     
            right time for cities/improvements when one of your units is    
            selected                                                        
                                                                            
          - Fixed comment in CityLevelUpBonuses.xml that caused             
            malformed xml                                                   
                                                                            
          - Fixed badly merged text in QuestUnits.xml for Talax             
                                                                            
          - Fixed end tags in CoreCityWalls                                 
                                                                            
          - Fixed game modifiers and ending tag after Magnar_Staff in       
            CoreSpecialWeapons.xml                                          
                                                                            
          - Fixed end tag for Thumb in SpecialUnitProps.xml                 
                                                                            
          - Fixed comments in UnitSoundPacks.xml                            
                                                                            
          - note: thanks to â€˜kenataâ€™ and â€˜heavenfallâ€™ for helping us        
            hunt down those above XML issues down and pointing us to        
            some cool data checking tools

          - Tile Editor: Fixed bug where large silhouette figure would      
            render in the middle of a tile design when placing              
            pedestrians                                                     
                                                                            
          - Map Editor: when using the creature placement tool, defaults    
            to giving the creature a random wander radius, which can be     
            changed with the tool's third spinner in the bottom left        
             corner                                                         
                                                                            
          - Also changed the wander radius 0 item to say "Don't Wander"     
            instead, does what the default used to do, cause the unit to    
            not even go into auto-patrol mode                               
                                                                            
          - Added new data def type, CSpellResourceCost, which can be       
            used in spell def xml to specify resource costs on casting a    
            spell, as well as any persistent maintenance costs if this      
            spell is an enchantment                                         
                                                                            
          - tag used in the SpellResourceCost xml object to say whether     
            the cost is deducted at time of casting (Per-Turn is 0), or     
            if it is a continued maintenance cost that exists as long as    
            the spell is in effect through an enchantment (Per-Turn is      
            non-zero)                                                       
                                                                            
          - Note: maintenance resource costs can only be per-turn if the    
            spell is an enchantment; there's no one-time cut to per-turn    
            resource production from an instant, non-enchantment spell      
                                                                            
          - Here's an example of some xml to put in a spell def, making     
            this spell cost 5 metal immediately when cast, and having a     
            maintenance cost of 1 material per turn until the               
            enchantment is cancelled:
