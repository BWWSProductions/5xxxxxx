Hope this helps ~-~"

I haven't been able to use any updates the game with crack works fine but the updates seems to have problems."
,CaptainCapsaicin,2011-01-19T08:51Z,"Okay, updating worked by installing each patch in order: 1.01, 1.05, 1.05 hotfix. 1.06 stuck me on the splash screen again, so I rebooted and deleted DataZip.exe from the main game folder. Worked perfectly. Continued on starting from 1.09 and every patch worked up to 1.11, but I had to delete DataZip.exe each time.

1.09+ say they have all the previous content, so you should be able to install the game and then just patch 1.11 (deleting DataZip.exe), and it should work fine without the other patches. Have fun. :)"
,prfella,2011-04-11T09:18Z,"Deleting Datazip.exe will get past the loading screen. However, now that I get to the selection screen, I cant click on anything other than ""options"" ""workshop"", and ""exit"" . I cant click on new game to start a new game. Anyone know how to get around this?"
