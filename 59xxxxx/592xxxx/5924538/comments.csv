,kjettern,2010-11-01T16:15Z,This is crap. Some sort of bootleg stuff with very poor audio quality. Avoid.
,ratmproj,2010-11-01T19:38Z,"of course it is ""bootleg"", look at the source: ripped youtube 720p videos.

I had no master audio, so I had to extract audio/edit/copy from several sources.

Best way to enjoy audio is put it at full blast with headphones with some bass.
