I see that TvTeam is a VIP member, so maybe it is an honest mistake?"
,vicocet,2011-03-04T23:55Z,"I don't like being the negative comment guy, especially since this is a good copy, but shortly after DL my IP blocked me because showtime networks sent them a message that I had violated copyright infringement, and until I filled out the warning from my Ip that I would cease and desist any further abuse of the internet or they will no longer provide me their service. I'm sure many of you have had this happen to you. This is the second time it has happened to me the first was from a copy of The Fighter I was downloading. It was about 5% complete when I got that warning. I'm not sure how this works because as I mentioned The fighter was only 5% completed when whichever movie company found me, but This download of Dexter I've had for 5 days. Then all of a sudden Showtime finds out about it. How does that happen? Can anyone please explain? "
