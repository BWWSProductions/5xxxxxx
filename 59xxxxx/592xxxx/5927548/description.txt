I ripped this movie from my satellite receiver DeramBox DM500+ from OSN Cinema Channel using "mFaraj DreamBox Viewer 4"
I don't know much about the file like encoders or resolution or bitrate as the app did it for me while I was sleeping thanks to the record timer,
all I can say is video is good 7.5 / 10 and audio is better 8 / 10
Please forgive me I have 2 MB DSL and the upload is terrible, bear with me a little and when u finish please help seeding,

THIS MOVIE IS NOT ENGLISH

IT IS DUBBED IN ARABIC (EGYPTIAN ACCENT)

SEED & ENJOY THEN SEED SOME MORE
