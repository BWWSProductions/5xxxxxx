very good suggestion that would be very helpful becuase that way i would be able to keep all the songs in my itunes insted of removing them and putting the new ones to avoid doubleing of songs."

Theres no need for a seperate folder, you can just select what files you want from the torrent when you open it. there is no need to download all of them :o)"
