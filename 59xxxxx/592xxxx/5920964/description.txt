"Breaking Point" is an R&B song by American singer Keri Hilson. The song was written by Hilson herself and produced by Timbaland and is taken as the lead single from her upcoming second studio album, No Boys Allowed. The song was released digitally in the United States on September 7, 2010.

The music video for the single was confirmed by Hilson herself via Twitter and Facebook on September 10, 2010. She stated that Bryan Barber shot the video. The video was shot in her hometown of Atlanta. The music video premiered Monday, October 4th, 2010 on BET's 106 and Park.

Sara D Anderson of Aol Radio Blog said that "Over a strutting, mid-tempo Timbaland-produced back beat, Keri soars vocally, incorporating an improvisational gospel style, while she lays down the law of love, stating "some women can be lied to / And cheated on, and beated on," but admits, "See I done did that / But this time, there's a limit to my love."

The concept of the song itself is about moving on from relationships that are not working and expecting men to step up to the plate and show women more respect and love. Hilson said about the song: "The song is about that breaking point that every woman gets to when the excuses given by boys are no longer accepted. If you're not man enough to step to the plate, then keep it moving".
