You're always welcome.

To answer your question; The aim is, quality for size/cost. In my opinion, what would be gained in video/audio quality by re-encoding for DVD9 is miniscule compared with what would be lost in Dual Layer disc cost, reliability, and popularity because of those factors.

If technology allowed DVD9/BD-R discs to be bought for pennies as indeed DVD5 discs are, and everyone enjoyed much faster down/upstream speeds, I'd just lift the original data from blu-ray discs and upload those, because it would be the best result for everyone, AND it would save me a day+ re-encoding 1080p movies, lol. Unfortunately, that isn't the case...yet.

It's still food-for-thought, so thank you for your input. =)"
