                    Contemporary drama series. Divorcee Anne has  
                    very few opportunities to meet a new man and  
                    has no social life to speak of, spending much  
                    of her time looking after her mother, Bella.  
                    Her only contact with her globe-trotting son is  
                    via email, so when the computer breaks down she  
                    is devastated. However, things soon look up  
                    when computer repairman John enters her life.  
                    Soon, she and John plan to visit her son in  
                    Australia, but are met with a hurdle in the  
                    form of Anne's selfish sister, Lynne, and an  
                    ultimatum involving their mother. But does  
                    Lynne have a point?
