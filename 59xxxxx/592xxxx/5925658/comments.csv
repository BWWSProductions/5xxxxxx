,thunderx7,2010-11-01T12:28Z,Is there a reason why this release is fucking 2.19 GB whereas other 50 min long 720p releases are only 1.09 GB?
,buffel,2010-11-01T13:43Z,"""Is there a reason why this release is fucking 2.19 GB whereas other 50 min long 720p releases are only 1.09 GB?""

,davhys,2010-11-02T03:26Z,"What is a good player for .mkv files?  DivX is what opened automatically, but apparently can't play the sound and I am having a hard time finding a player that will or a codec for it."
,davhys,2010-11-02T03:39Z,"I found and downloaded VLC player immediately after posting that last comment which looks and sounds pretty good, though I'm glad I can actually hear it at all.  Other suggestions are appreciated still.  =)"
,lievenazerty,2010-11-02T17:58Z,"Davhys, even windows media player plays .mkv files, otherwise vlc is probably the best video player in general, plus it plays almost every file type you can think of, so you shouyld be ok with vlc"
,Final_Justice,2010-11-02T18:00Z,another stupid mkv file.
,fallout11,2010-11-02T23:14Z,"It's 720p, so of course it is .mkv (matroska), a format that has been around since 2003.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroska
VLC, MPC, and WMP all work fine, among many, many more."
,metalvegetax,2010-11-03T02:31Z,Fake previevs NOT the show in full dont wast your time
,thepiratejary,2010-11-04T00:15Z,Its so laggy I can't watch it! >:(
,ss1138,2010-11-04T01:07Z,I am so goddamn sick of these EZTV mkvs that lose a/v sync when you run them through GotSent. Fuck this shit. 
,CyanideX,2010-11-04T01:11Z,"Why is it that ALL 720p uploads are so freakin' quiet? It's not bad when I can blast it on my TV, but I can't hear it at all on my computer with headphones. Is there a reason why this happens or something I can do about it?

I appreciate the upload by the way. :)"
,weaping_reaper,2010-11-05T18:30Z,"Long live the MKV .. I don't care what you Ids say, "
,stupot101,2010-11-05T20:25Z,"No lag or playback issues for me, and I have a very average laptop. Try using Media Player Classic - Home Cinema. 

A - 9
V - 9
Zombies - 10

,tapazia,2010-11-07T06:08Z,"Thanks EZTV you've doing great work for so long, it's too bad this isn't a legitimate business so you could become a corporate monster =)

This is the best new show in a while people, download it."
,holabandola2,2010-11-07T17:56Z,"For the last time, there is usually never anything wrong with an uppload! Not low sound, laggy frames, band synched etc. The problem is that u people are doing something wrong or just havent the required hardware/software. Stop complaining if ur not a hundred percent sure that it's the upload thats the problem."
,rambo202,2010-11-29T20:04Z,"I download so many of EZTV 720p stuff and have it playing through a serious system on my TV. i have NEVER had a problem.

try buying a computer with a bit more kick... or down load the low-res version."
,akwey1,2010-12-04T00:27Z,"Many thanks eztv

I've heard some great things about the show so I'm glad you're around to help me catch up on all the shows I missed.  It makes watching the newer ones on TV bearable."
,Rickslick,2010-12-12T15:31Z,Thanx =)
,cheo2010,2010-12-16T19:06Z,Thanks nice work.
,the_nr1-n00b,2011-01-30T23:20Z,"BEST SHOW EVER!!! GO BUY THE DVDs/BluRay when coming! =D   I Know I WILL  :D:D:D:D:D

Thanks for the upload, very good quallity both sound and video!
but still, if people like this, then buy it! And it will keep coming ;)"
,Painweaver,2011-10-18T04:42Z,"As much as I appreciate Eztv, these HD copies are garbage.  They are just as good as the less than 500 mb versions out there.  This episode alone is almost as big as the whole season in the smaller size format.  The only difference I can tell between the two of them is the freaking size.

A:9
V:5 

Not HD only HD in size.  Look for another version."
