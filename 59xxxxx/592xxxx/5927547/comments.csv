,bckmnjsh,2010-11-13T03:37Z,"~DON'T DOWNLOAD~  This is just a ton of hi-res wallpapers and videos of black ops, compressed into an iso file. This dumbass wasted my time.
I repeat, THIS IS NOT CALL OF DUTY BLACK OPS."

,gtzrunnaz,2010-11-16T22:52Z,"Can someone explain something to me please? I downloaded the game and burned it to a disc, popped it into the 360. I got the message that it was a mixed media disc and thus would not work. How do I get it to work? I downloaded the patch posted here but I have absolutely no idea if it has anything to do with my problem. Your help would be really appreciated as I am a n00b at this kind of stuff. Thanks."
