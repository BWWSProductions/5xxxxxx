This is the fourth of the five DVD's in the complete collection of Sixth and Final Season of LOST. As you can see from the torrent's size, this is the DVD9 image, which means the original, untouched DVD. Sorry, for the mixed-up order, DVD 3 is still in work and will have to be released later than expected.

PLEASE SEED THE TORRENT AFTER YOU DOWNLOAD IT.
