Description: 
Biographical talk show in which the former tabloid editor 
interviews a celebrity about their career and personal life. 
This week the host meets rock singer Rod Stewart, who 
came to prominence with the Jeff Beck Group and Faces 
before launching a successful solo career, which includes 
ten number one albums and eight chart-topping singles. 
Tonight Rod talks about the numerous women in his life,
 his battle with thyroid cancer in 2000 and how he feels 
about becoming a father at the age of 65, with his eighth 
child due to be born in early 2011. He also performs a 
track from his new album.
