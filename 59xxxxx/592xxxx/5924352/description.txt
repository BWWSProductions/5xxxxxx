Lyrics:

One more time, one more lie,
One more guilty smile at me.
So here we go, we\'ll take it all,
We\'ll take it now because we can.
So let us go we\'ll show them all,
That we can make it all on our own.
They used to put us down
But still we bring the fight.

Bring me down until you fall,
Break me down till I hit the floor,
And now you tell me that you were wrong,
And so I scream you know that,

I have found my reason to believe,
That we\'re not at the end of this all.
You know that I will stand by you,
Forever more.

So can you feel this pain,
For all of us I say we take them down,
So they know how it feels,
How it feels to be stepped on like we are.

Falling faster crying louder,
Stop pretending start revenging.
