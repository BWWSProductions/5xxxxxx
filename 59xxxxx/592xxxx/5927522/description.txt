Plot:

Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory won't find our skateboarding hero lounging around and scheming at the familiar Rob & Big house in the Hollywood Hills. Instead he's commanding operations in a massive, 25,000-square-foot industrial -- and fully skate-able -- warehouse and office complex near downtown Los Angeles. This is the new home of Dyrdek Enterprises, the veritable nerve center and hatching ground for all of Rob's crazy schemes, business plans and uniquely ridiculous ideas. Rob is a hustler, with a laundry list of business ventures he's trying to chase down. The MTV series Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory will follow the ridiculous action and comedy that seems to follow everything he takes on. Get ready to experience Rob Dyrdek on a whole new level.
