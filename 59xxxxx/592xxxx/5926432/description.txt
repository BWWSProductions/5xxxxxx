ENCODER'S NOTES:
Sources, Video= Pila.3D (russian cam), Audio=LKRG (thanks to both) So i dropped it into vdub and first i tried to fix the ininterlace issues i done the best i could and most of it is gone.I then re-sized as i thougth the a:r was off.
after that i used a denoise filter, changed the colours with a rgb eq, brightened, changed the contrast & finaly i sharpened.
