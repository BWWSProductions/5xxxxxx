The highly acclaimed PC-RPG The Dark Eye: Drakensang was awarded
"best German game" and "best German RPG" amongst many others. Drakensang:
The River of Time features all-new adventures in the medieval world of
Aventuria, based on one of Europe's favourite RPG systems: The Dark Eye

The prequel's story of Drakensang: The River of Time leads players to events
that took place 23 years before the original Drakensang game's events.
As a young apprentice, players meet the young dwarf Forgrimm and many other
recognisable characters.

Starting in Aventuria's Middenrealm in the city of Ferdok, the story of the
games takes players down the Great River to the city of Nadoret. Many mythical
legends entwine around this river and will also flow into the main plot.

The story will contain more twists than in Drakensang: With every place the
player visits, his view on things will change. Depending on the choice of
character and behavior new opportunities and series of quest will come up

Living on a ship, players will experience a broad variety of RPG quests.
There will be two new character archetypes to play, tons of new foes and
monsters as well as equipment items
