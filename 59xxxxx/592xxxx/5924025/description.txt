Release Notes:

System of a Down  founder Serj Tankian was born on August 
21, 1967, in Beirut, Lebanon. He and his family immigrated
to Los Angeles in 1975. He studied marketing at California
State University and started his own software company     
before beginning his music career with the formation of   
System of a Down in 1995. In 1998, System of a Down signed
on to Rick Rubin's American imprint, and over the         
following seven years released five well-received albums, 
the second of which, Toxicity, thrust them into the       
forefront of the metal community, garnered a Grammy       
nomination, and sold millions of copies. Tankian utilized 
his success to influence the political world he often     
commented on lyrically by co-founding a nonprofit         
organization called Axis of Justice with Rage Against the 
Machine and Audioslave guitarist Tom Morello. He remained 
active with System of a Down throughout the mid-2000s and 
also released a book of poetry, titled Cool Gardens,      
before SOAD  chose, in May 2006, to go on hiatus of an    
undetermined length. Tankian made use of this sabbatical  
to record his first solo album, Elect the Dead, which was 
released in fall 2007. Three years later, Tankian teamed  
up with the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra to release    
Elect the Dead Symphony, featuring songs from his solo    
debut backed by a live orchestra. Tankian's second solo   
album, Imperfect Harmonies, continued in the orchestral   
footsteps symphonically re-imagined debut.
