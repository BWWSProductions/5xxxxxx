i found this rom more stable than the other i uploaded, i currently use it.

this rom finds the gps device that is embedded in the htc.


2 ways for installation.

Option 1:

1) sync your htc
2) extract this rom
3) run update

Option 2:

1) extract this rom
2) rename the file HTCWWE_shipsigned.nbh --> ARTEIMG.NBH
3) Format a micro sd card to fat32 
4) copy this file to it.(to the root of the card!)
5) When the phone is off press the voice record and power button ( to get to the screen with the 3 colours.) if did it correct it will say reading sd contents, follow the steps and it will flash a brick htc.

good luck

its a english rom

please seed
