,ReBeLi0uS1,2010-11-02T07:57Z,worked!!!! pkaji123 you rule!!! seeding
,AliMech,2010-11-02T12:58Z,"It works, but you also get a trojan according to AVG. So I wouldn't download this torrent if I was you."
,ravensend,2010-11-02T15:15Z,does this work for the beta that just stopped working
,AliMech,2010-11-02T17:01Z,"Well okej, I guess AVG sucks sometimes. Thank you for a great torrent! :)"
,ReBeLi0uS1,2010-11-02T17:45Z,"@ravensend, yes it does. Mine was a BETA and it activated it and no more popup warnings on startup. The virus is a false positive also....so download it! :)"
,LightTheRebellion,2010-11-03T19:01Z,"I downloaded one of these Windows Office 2010 activators that contained a Trojan that was activated on October 29th.

It was CycBot, which attempts to clone your system using CRC checks and ***CANNOT BE CLEANED/REMOVED*** I used four programs, including Microsoft Forefront, which is designed exclusively for businesses, and it was still there.

BE AWARE OF THIS AS YOU WILL HAVE TO REFORMAT YOUR HARD DRIVE"
[T],pkaji123,2010-11-04T10:27Z,"This is 100% safe and working,Don't compare this torrent with any others uploaded in any other site,you can check for the hash from here..

,moizizzy,2010-11-04T13:51Z,it woked perfectly!.. Awesome tool thanks!
,mawkus,2010-11-04T15:53Z,"It didn't work for me :/ What do I do?

It says activation was succesfull, but i still get ""beta expired""-message. If I check the activation right after I get 

What have I done wrong?"
,mawkus,2010-11-05T19:51Z,@promodsharma you were right! :) thanks! :D and thanks to pkaji123 too! :) Allthough I used Sniffer_Vs torrent to install :P
,metrvr,2010-11-09T05:17Z,@pkaji123 - the tool does not work on a clean installed windows 7 64 bit machine which is up to date with all Microsoft patches.  It returns Failed to start KMSEmulator.exe which I presume is being blocked from running.
,ghostrider2218,2010-11-10T00:26Z,anyone know how to fix the Product Activation for office 2010? its really annoying having a popup reminding me every time i open office 2010!!
,junkbrol,2010-11-10T11:40Z,"well, after unblokking some restrictions on my machine it did the job

the virus-scan after seems clear so far

I am wondering what the degree of cooperation is between antivirus-software-companies and ...
of course they should consider any keygen as a virus

anyway, I will always remain extremely suspicious for this ""activator - tools - kits & things"" 

BUT, I have to admit this piece of kit from pkaji123 it did activate my whole office

thx for you upload !"
,tator_tot,2010-11-15T07:55Z,worked great using the ez-activator. literally one click and done.
,a1trips,2010-11-17T16:56Z,"Ended all my headaches with one click. 

Thanks for the gr8 program. worked wonderfully."
,agosign,2010-11-19T00:22Z,"Thank you vm. One click on the EZ-Activator and the job gets done nice and smooth, no more warnings, nothing !! Great."
,agosign,2010-11-19T00:35Z,"I forgot to say just earlier, I got the 2 trojan horse meredrop and keygen hack warnings as others have mentioned and I let my antivirus eliminate them right away from my computer, which everyone should do to keep safe. But that does not preclude the activator to work great."
,seegje,2010-11-20T12:57Z,thanx mate
,Vaygrian,2010-11-21T02:20Z,"Don't download!
This is FULL of viruses.
I thought ""trusted"" people could be trusted, they most certainly can NOT. Contained 10-12 viruses AND DID NOT WORK!
It says I have no rearms left though I only rearmed once before. I can't remember where I found the working rearmer though and I removed it since."
,junkbrol,2010-11-23T23:49Z,"It think it is worth mentioning that it ONLY REACTIVATES office for another 180 days (as you can discover in your activation status) ...

that said, if the anti-virus deleted the activator after you used it, you will have to install it again after 180 days

I am defenitly looking for a better LONGTERM sollution !"
,montesino,2010-11-25T13:11Z,"I'm just guessing here, but I think the Trojan or virus someone mentioned here has to do because the utility has to use a keygen-crack in order to validate or activate Office 2010.

And about the 180 days (as most KMS servers do) I just wonder if the utility also takes care of that as if you check the TAB called ""Automation Tools"" and in that window you'll see ""Office 2010 AutoKMS and it shows as ""Installed"". I am not sure of this but probably this will take care of the re-activation automatically after the 180 days has expired ?

Anyhow I was able to activate Office 2010 on Windows 7 64-bit, and so far was the only one that it did as I had tried several ones before and none of them worded or have a bunch of virus which I didn't trust."
[T],pkaji123,2010-11-26T11:26Z,"@Vaygrian

don't try to blame this torrent unless you know what a false positive means."
,31583,2010-11-27T18:15Z,"Finally. I have been dicking around with different torrents for 3 days. The only ones I could find were ones that simply renewed the grace periods (which is ok I guess).

However, now I have a permanent fully activated version! Many thanks to you pkaji123."
,xakXOLAS,2010-11-29T18:35Z,"STOP ANTIVIRUS, INSTALL ACTIVATOR, RESTART PC, REMOVE TROJAN AND OK. THIS PERFECT WORK!!!

,senyorito,2010-12-03T11:22Z,"@pkaji123:  Thank you very much mate!  Finally, I've activated my ms office.  I only had 5 days remaining.  The other torrent that I used from a diffrent uploader -- naah, his activator didn't work on me.

Thanks again!"
,evilline,2010-12-04T01:11Z,"I am using Win 7 Home prem on this laptop 64 - it is a new laptop so came with the OS. I can't get this to work to activate MSO 2010 I get errors saying it failed to start the KMSEmulator.exe.
 I have the same problem with the one from ""thethingy"" for the KMS it gives the error that ""can't launch C:\\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\7Zipsfx.000\01.6.exe PpVL or C:\\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\7Zipsfx.000\01.6.exeKMSa"" any help would be awesome. 

would love to activate this copy of MSO 2010 pro. Thank you in advance for your help."
,BadExodus,2010-12-07T10:47Z,"Great work pkaji123, thanks a lot! Had 2 days left and this tool successfully helped me get another 180 days :) I tried others before this but this one was the only one successful so far!"
,SirMaxy,2010-12-07T17:56Z,"also activated Visio premium 2010, fabulous toolkit ;)... Thanks again pkaji123 highly appreciated :)  "
,dred123,2010-12-16T17:26Z,"the activating file KMSEmulator.exe which is created by the program and then run by the program is blocked by AVG 2011, i cant get it to unblock it, any ideas? if i click ignore it still blocks, Thanks"
,SOLOinc,2010-12-19T21:09Z,"evilline, you probably have to turn off your antivirus while you install the activator"
,dred123,2010-12-21T16:12Z,"i have now completely turned it of but for some unknown reason it is still blocked?
Plese help

Thanks"
,Generalb85,2010-12-25T02:03Z,Thank you so much dude !! Works great...
,calpacint,2010-12-28T11:18Z,"Its work,thanks pkaji123"
,GameWorld,2010-12-28T22:40Z,"IT WORKS! Yes, it Works!
The KMSEmulator.exe is NOT a virus! These programs are made to bypass windows files, that's why anti-viruses consider them as trojans.
I've instelled it, then used the updated serial numbers and everything works fine for me! Good job!"
,wetsnay,2011-01-10T05:14Z," pkaji123, Brilliant, simply Brilliant!!! Incidentally, it made 10 attempts then when it ran the final code it was activated.

PURE GENIOUS....."
,scottyhull,2011-12-06T13:00Z,"excellent clicked EZ-Activator then waited a few seconds. AVG recognised a Virus but i just put it in the vault anbd deleted it whilst EZ was running and now i have a licensed Office 2010!
Thanks keep up the good work.
Lets thank allah"
,cw3pd,2012-01-21T19:01Z,"Beware, trojan detected as soon as i opened it"
