From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with intrepid investigative journalist Wayne Madsen  about the unfolding Yemen toner bomb propaganda campaign. Madsen attended the University of Mississippi where he joined the Navy ROTC and was later commissioned an ensign and underwent training at the Surface Warfare School. Between 1985 and 1989 Madsen held a series of jobs, first working for RCA as a government consultant on contracts for the National Security Agency (NSA) and later he worked for the Navy's Naval Data Automation Command as a civilian employee. After this Madsen briefly established his own consulting firm, then worked for the National Bureau of Standards, and later for the State Department. He currently edits and publishes the Wayne Madsen Report.

[FWIW, Ted Anderson is on in hour 2 for about as much time as Wayne Madsen.]




Prison Planet.tv editor and journalist Paul Joseph Watson and author and GCN radio host Webster Tarpley also discuss the Yemen non-bombing incident. Tarpley is the author of Obama: The Postmodern Coup

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
