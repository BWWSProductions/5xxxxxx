Um, no, rather, idiots like you need to quit posting comments. Movies are split for various reasons, e.g. so you can burn to CDs. Also, the larger the file, the greater the chance it will have errors when downloaded. That's a great reason for RAR files. 

In any case, from your perspective, two files is way better than 50, so don't complain."
,dejy,2010-10-31T01:15Z,"I agree with Strikefear13, we don’t need split files anymore. It is the year 2010 almost 2011 and we can now burn onto DVD's, blu-rays or just put them on our 1TB Media drives or even wirelessly stream them to our tvs from our computers, so there is no need to split files for CD size. Oh and with torrents whatever the file size is it gets split into blocks, downloaded, verified and then put back together so no matter how big the file is the chances of a corruption are the same which equals slim to none."
