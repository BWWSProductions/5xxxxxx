I just started downloading it but with the horrible ratio 200+/1000+ its gonna take like 3 days, and the last one I downloaded had the wrong video.iso in it and I couldn;t patch the new one in. kept saying corrupted even though i got the video from abgx360's website"
,roher4,2010-11-12T04:36Z,do you need a modded 360?

Yes you do"
,bigbird1040,2010-11-12T14:37Z,"Thanks to @.BONE.  question though (for anyone), you guys don't need to reveal how you get these game early...I just want to know if it came from a real disk.  

I patched this sucker with SSv2 in abgx360, and everything is coming up green now.  But I'm still a little skurred that maybe you guys ripped this from some special ""early edition"" of the game, and that maybe M$ is more likely to detect it?  

I've got the LT firmware on a samsung and I've been playing backups for almost a year now with no probs.  I've even been playing mw2 on the new dashboard, and haven't been b& yet"
,pete1599,2010-11-12T18:26Z,great download. started out at 50mb/s but then just rapidly to 300 around the end of the download. passed abgx first time and seems to be SSV2 when i checked it so no need for patching it. burning it now at 1x to make sure i dont get banned. GREAT UPLOAD THUMBS UP .BONE
,Fredis-X,2010-11-14T13:07Z,Is this an SSv2 or SSv1 rip?

thanks"
,desjardins81,2010-11-19T10:02Z,"Exact same problem as todmche -
Unreadable disc, tried several times... help please!!!"
,warlockwizard,2010-11-19T18:19Z,"@todmche & desjardins81
This file does not have the .dvd extention file so you will need to run it through abgx and it will be created.  Use IMG burn to burn the disc using the .dvd file.  This will fix the file error although this game still does not pass abgx stealth check flawlessly so playing it online may work for some time but you could get flagged and banned at a later date. From what I read the Ban Hammer is coming soon. Be warned! 
All users-- Please post results if you play this online.  Thanks"

I got mine done at iOffer.com. 

If you just search on the site for 'xbox flash' or 'xbox jtag' you can find a service for it easily. Don't pay more than $20 as a base price (not including S&H) because you'd be paying too much. Anyone with a very good rating (with many of them too) should be trustworthy. 

If you don't have the equipment or skill, this option is highly recommended. I would have, but didn't have a pc to do it on, so I went with this and I'm glad I did it!"
