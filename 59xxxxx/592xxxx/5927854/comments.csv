When you launch the Serial Box app you have to install the 11-2010 database in order to see any serials. Follow the instructions below.

1) Unzip file you downloaded
2) Open iSerial Reader 2.0.8.dmg
3) Drag the Serial Reader to you Applications folder or anywhere you want it to reside
4) Unzip Serial Box 11-2010 #100 file
5) Inside that folder you will see a file named Serial Box 11-2010 #100.sb2 with a green icon, that's the serial database.
6) Open Serial Reader app
7) At the menu bar click iSerial Reader then Preferences
8) Select the Serial Box 2 tab
9) At the top you will see an ""Install Now"" button, click it and find the Serial Box 11-2010 #100.sb2 with the green icon
10) Once it installs you will be all good to go, ENJOY!

I know for a fact this works because I have it on my computer now and I didn't have any problems running it. I guessing the other hundreds of people that downloaded this torrent didn't either because there are no other comments. Any other questions please ask. "
