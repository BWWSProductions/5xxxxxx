                           P R E S E N T S

      THE ARCHIVE TEAM ANNIVERSARY GEOCITIES TORRENT VERSION 1.0

                                 or

    "Your webpage isn't classy without a MIDI soundtrack background"

                                 or

                "Seriously, what the shit, Yahoo!?" 

  =========================================================================
  HERE IS THE IMPORTANT MESSAGE WHICH YOU SHOULD READ BEFORE DOING TOO MUCH
  =========================================================================

  This is a collection of Geocities data downloaded by a bunch of people who
  call themselves ARCHIVE TEAM, who began scraping the Yahoo! Geocities site
  during a six month period in 2009, before Yahoo! shut down geocities.com 
  on October 26th, 2009. This collection is compressed in a UNIX filesystem
  with both 7zip archives and tape archives (gtar). If you're a bit of a
  data tourist and just want to waft in the scent of a web era gone by, please
  go to one of the Geocities mirrors that were put up in the wake of the end
  of Geocities. As of this writing, these mirrors include:

  http://www.reocities.com
  http://www.geocities.ws
  http://www.geociti.es
  http://www.oocities.org/

  You'll get your fix and you won't go into internet rage when you find you
  downloaded hundreds of gigabytes of THING YOU DO NOT WANT.

  =========================================================================

  This collection was put together by nearly 100 folks assembling at the news
  of the death of Geocities, a website that allowed free hosting of web pages
  from roughly 1994 (in beta) to 2009. In 1999, it was purchased by Yahoo! 
  for three billion dollars. We're not kidding here: billion with a b.

  At the time of the purchase, Geocities was the THIRD most popular website on
  the Internet. Even by the time of its shutdown, it was in the top 250. We
  don't have complete rock-solid knowledge of why it was shut down, but all 
  signs point to Yahoo! trying to get back to basics (like, uh, having a huge
  audience?) and Geocities magically didn't fall into this new "focus", and
  lacked any internal cheerleader to make it last through meetings.

  Yahoo! succeeded in destroying the most amount of history in the shortest
  amount of time, certainly on purpose, in known memory. Millions of files,
  user accounts, all gone. 

  We are unsure how much of Geocities was rescued in this package you have,
  but we do know we got enough for it to represent a good amount. Attempts to
  contact Yahoo! to get any hard numbers were consistently rebuffed; we 
  suspect even Yahoo! didn't know exactly how many accounts and files they
  had. As mentioned in the IMPORTANT MESSAGE, others were concurrently 
  downloading Geocities and used alternate methods of discovery, so our datasets
  do not overlap 100%. The hope is that more will contribute datasets over time
  and a good amount of Geocities will be available for study.

  ===========================================================================
          SO WHO IN THE GOOD GODDAMN WOULD WANT ALL OF THESE FILES 
  ===========================================================================

  While we don't feel the need to act like a 1950s commercial inventing new ways
  to use hula hoops and baking powder, the most likely candidates for this 
  Geocities Anniversary Collection are researchers, scientists, historians and
  developers who wish to work with a large collection of information hand-made
  by millions of free labor. We forsee application tests, sociology studies, 
  academic articles and history tests putting this to good use. 

  Our job is not to find a use for it. Our job was to save it. Now we're giving
  it to whoever wants it.

  ============================================================================
                               DISCLAIMER
  ============================================================================

  If you go "but what about...." when you think about the repercussions of having
  this data set, please save us all a lot of trouble and just delete it off your
  hard drive and go watch some tv and don't talk of it again.

  ============================================================================
    THE VERY BORING BUT PROBABLY RATHER IMPORTANT TECHNICAL NOTES FOR YOU
  ============================================================================

  Inside this torrent collection are the following directories:

  ARCHIVES
  GEOCITIES
  LOWERCASE
  MEDIA
  NUMBERS
  SUBSITES
  UPPERCASE
  WORKSHOP
  YAHOO

  MEDIA is just a quick set of press releases from Yahoo! and an mp3 interview 
  about Archive Team and the importance of saving this digital history.

  The rest are collections of .7z files. 7z is an archive format called 7ZIP.
  To unpack these archives, use 7zip to create... well, a bunch of large files.
  
  These large files are GNU Tar archives, which will then recreate a collection
  of directories related to Geocities. And then it gets weird.
 
  As a scraper (wget) was used to get these many files, and the resulting set of
  data was very huge, these collections of archives were then sorted down by 
  some rough headings. So UPPERCASE are Yahoo! IDs on geocities (something like
  http://www.geocities.com/DigitalHolocaust) that started with an uppercase 
  letter. LOWERCASE are lowercase, like http://www.geocities.com/deletegeocities.
  NUMBERS began with numbers, like http://www.geocities.com/69convent.

  WORKSHOP is our own junkbins of lists, scripts, and other tools used for getting
  Geocities and the URL sets we combined together with lots of google and other
  searches to find some seeds to grab items. Almost nobody wants this, trust us,
  we're just providing you what we generated along the way.

  As you run scrapers, they sometimes span hosts and come out with a bunch of
  other sites. This is what's in SUBSITES.

  Finally, GEOCITIES is the www.geocities.com site, with TONS of links over to
  a /geocities/YAHOOIDS directory structure that UPPERCASE, LOWERCASE, and 
  NUMBERS created.

  Make sense? Well, you'll figure it out.
