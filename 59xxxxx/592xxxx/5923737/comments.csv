[V],phatwarez,2010-10-31T15:25Z,Cool beans. Not quite 900gb.
,pimpampet123,2010-11-01T23:03Z,This must be the most impressive torrent (both in terms of filesize and content) to ever be created. Amazing job!
[T],FaeGiN,2010-11-08T17:35Z,"Wow. this is brilliant. Respect to all concerned with this task.
:)"
,cyraxjoe,2010-12-02T08:20Z,"Somebody please SEED, everyone are getting just the 35% of the torrent."
,billybob45,2010-12-07T12:56Z,so if we use reocities.com or any of the 4 sites you mention we get to see the same data as in this 641gb file correct ?
,SuperCPU,2010-12-10T19:40Z,"People, please seed! I am stuck at 44% for a whole week now."
,Jason Scott,2011-02-22T13:23Z,"Hello, Jason Scott of Archive Team here. After a couple disk crashes, a router that went south but not south enough to be obviously broken, and all sorts of other stuff, I'm happy to say the last piece of this torrent is being uploaded to a fast seed, and in the next few days you will see 100% seeders start to rise up. Thanks for everyone and their patience."
,jozsus,2011-03-13T04:53Z,Is this still alive?
