{11/1/10}
Team ZRO is back! Leaving year\'s of hiatus in the wake, I plan on
uploading every CD I own, which is close to 70 or so. 

[WILL NOT RESEED UNLESS REQUESTED]

Shoot an email to zrotorrents@hush.com
-If you want to join the team.
-If you have a request for anything, I will attempt to acquire the original copy,
otherwise, I\'ll try to find a download and reupload it, if no seeders are available.

Keep the spirit of torrenting alive! Download everything, and buy the best.

Love,
NESTER, of TeamZRO.
