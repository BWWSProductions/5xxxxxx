,corintho,2010-11-11T18:05Z,"I followed the steps correctly. The screen appeared automatically key the game installed without any errors. After install, when I start a career, the game loads up the screen where I inform my data to start the game. A new screen appears saying that windows encountered an error 7.
I use Window s7 professional with 4 gb of memory. My video card is the GeForce 9800GTX +.

Someone has gone through this error?"
