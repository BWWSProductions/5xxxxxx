Cos as multi player game its worse thene useless. only reason i download the game is to get a shoot at singel player witch i havent tried yet..."
,nukelfish,2010-11-04T10:22Z,why do you want to play a fps game with a xbox controller? if you want to play the game online just buy the game. 60 bucks is too much for a game but you can buy it online much cheaper for like 25 bucks

,yeshu26,2011-01-02T14:28Z,"Hello,

1. I never see a single ISO file after download. I see 100's of rar files, and interestingly when I extract any of them the extracted file becomes some 7 GB file. The installation is successful with a key generator.

Is this normal? Why give so many rar files, if one does the job?

2. I tried running from the binary folder as suggested by someone, but it never works for me. Why? please help."
