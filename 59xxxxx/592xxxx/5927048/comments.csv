[V],twentyforty,2010-11-02T09:19Z,"@MetryKat: Playback recommendations, tips and advices are in torrent description at least once per day (to save space in TPB database). So, click on my screen-name and browse through my recent torrents or jump directly to 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5927312/Monsters.2010.HDTV.720p.H264
and read throughly and apply by the numbers given there."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-02T17:41Z,"@doyll: Unfortunately - read the name of the first movie. That is sadly the truth.

Further, common practice is to post  links to torrents, that way chances for better turn-out are greater."
