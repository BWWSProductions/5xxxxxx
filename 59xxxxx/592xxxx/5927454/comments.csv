But you have to be really picky: Read what others think of individual uploads, download only one file to preview instead of all files, etc.

I agree on the fact the NlSubs dudes sometimes offers us shajty poop-ups. But it wouldnĂÂ´t be easy removing their skulls, since it seems like, and I believe that some of them actually are administrators, thus themselves handing out the skulls...

Why? When taking my complaints to the forum, wondering how to stop the NlSubs-mafia from leaving out important info, upping fake and malicious stuff, I was threatened and my accounnt was dropped like a dwarf on a tall peoples convention...

Something is wrong here. Either they are Gods, and Gods make mistakes to. Or they are a part of the film industry, trying to ruin piratebay by fawlty uploads. Or pherhaps they are just schizzo mongos, uploading by chance,  giving no second thought to what downloaders think."
