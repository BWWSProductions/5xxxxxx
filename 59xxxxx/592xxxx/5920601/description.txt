From IMDB:

Alfred Salteena is a slightly bumbling gentleman who meets a young lady on a train and invites her to his home in London. She comes to see society and meet young men and bothers him to go out and meet important people. They travel to see Lord Bernard where Alfred realises that he is not "high society" enough to win the beautiful social climber Ethel. Bernard offers to send him to a training school to help gentlemen "improve themselves", while he "entertains" Ethel at his home.
