,Anonym156,2011-01-07T13:15Z,well as soon as I noticed 2001 a space odyssey isnt in the list I knew I wouldnt download it
,kritias,2011-04-07T18:14Z,"Because not having a certain movie on a list means the rest of the movies on the list suck? GG Mr. Logical, your loss."
,AeSix_Reficul,2011-05-24T07:02Z,"Most of these movies are ones with less notariaty than they deserve. 2001 and 2010 are movies that everyone knows. Class A Sci-Fi Classic movies. Like Star Wars trilogy, Star Trek The Motion Picture, and Planet of the Apes. Any self respecting Sci-fi movie collector would already have these movies, so, shouldn't matter. 

These movies are really more for people who truly enjoy sci-fi for sci-fi and not for the sake of having a collection.  Yeah, there's some exceptions there, still. If you're too stuck up to download other good movies cause one is missing - one you should already own, then you, sir, need a job at the white house."
