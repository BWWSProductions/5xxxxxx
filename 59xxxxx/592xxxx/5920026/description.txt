I love USAO, he has this habit of making my ears overflow with joy when listening to his hardstyle and gabber tracks, especially Irrelevance from Hardcore Syndrome 3 â˜š(ï¾Ÿâ€¿ï¾Ÿâ˜š). This is his latest album, almost entirely jumpstyle, and it's got a select few good tracks. The ones I recommend from this are Sakura era, UNSTABLE SKY AND OTHERS, which is some really weird intense makina/jumpstyle/hard trancish/ blended with hardcore, and though I normally hate Sharpnel this track is an exception; and Vacuum break, more jumpstyle.

Give it a shot if you like jumpstyle or USAO, hopefully you'll find something to keep in your library.
