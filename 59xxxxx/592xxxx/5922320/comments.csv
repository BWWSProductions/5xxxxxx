note's: well the Copacabana footage was
urgeing for re-seed but none would give and
icouldnt give a seed eithen though i created
the first torrent & let natty share it, i had
hard disk death so i lost file archive so that
is why...but i thought this is a bit too small
too share and i had this other brazilian footage
so i thought i might as well start from scratch
and add the other one as a bonus thus then easy
creates just half a gigabyte (500mb) so that is good
enough for me and hopefully for you. i have added
i mini collarge of images from videos also md5
included so keep this archive in how i'am givin it
too you ever so simple too do...any who too thouse
who missed this due too lack or not wanting to seed
seeder's your wait was worth it you get bonus too !
