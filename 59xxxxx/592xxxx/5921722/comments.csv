,D3LinQuENT,2010-10-31T15:50Z,has anybody tested it yet?! Is it legit?!
,SadoSan,2010-11-01T10:14Z,Does it work on HardDrive??I mean through hd loader.?BEcause I can't make it..I've try on mode 3 but it still doesn't work.Can someone help me?Please
,simendifer,2010-11-01T14:03Z,This is probably fake. 2.01 is too small for 2011 and thee are .rar files. So after the download it will need a password and we have to visit another site to find it. did some one download this torrent ? 
[V],bob5695,2010-11-01T17:10Z,"this isn't a fake because:
if it were a fake it would have been deleted by now
and
if it were a fake it wouldn't have been uploaded by a trusted member.
plus, the .iso is 2.19GB, not 2.01GB.
iso inside rar = compression"

,simendifer,2010-11-02T00:21Z,"bob5695 did you downloadthis torrent? is game working and is it real 2011 or upgraded 2010? .rar  files are 2.01gb what about iso file?
or someone can respond?"
[V],bob5695,2010-11-02T02:11Z,"you download 2.01GB of rar's, then you extract a 2.19GB iso out of them, and this is pes2011, not pes2010."
[V],bob5695,2010-11-02T02:20Z,"however, if you feel that a 2.19GB iso is too small for your liking, you can grab the spanish + portuguese + italian + greek version of the game, as the iso for that version is 2.80GB, and is also available here at tpb."
,therealsicilian,2010-11-02T12:18Z,"I'm downloading this right now. Please, guys, if you already downloaded the game, tell us does it work."

,joey_oggie,2010-11-05T01:57Z,"Sure looks like a great game but I have a small problem. :)
I burnt it on a DVD and tried it on PCSX Emulator, it worked fine (although a little bit slow)
I then put that DVD in a modded PS2, says ""Please insert a Playstation or Playstation 2 format disk""
The PS2 is modded and can play many games which I have downloaded from the internet including the previos PES game (2010). What would be causing this issue?"
