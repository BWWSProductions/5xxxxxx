Release Notes:

Thanx to both sources. Video was decent for first cam out, adjusted colors and brightness/ contrast ect. Rotated and cropped slightly to eliminate camera movement. Now as for the audio, two different audio sources used, but only for 2 minutes toward the end. Beginning and end scenes intact, audio is COMPLETE. Enjoy.
