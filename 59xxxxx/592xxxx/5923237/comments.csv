,TheDyb,2010-10-31T18:18Z,"@xsimsimx Download the one that fits your system, if you have  newer system with an intel cpu then get the x86 version. I have an intel core 2 duo with osx 10.6.4 so I downloaded the 9.0.12 x86 version. You can check your CPU type by clicking on the apple from the top menu then going to ""about this mac"""
