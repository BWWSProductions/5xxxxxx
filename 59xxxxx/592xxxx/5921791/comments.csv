I use Moyea Blu-Ray Ripper to rip the M2TS (Bluray) and DTS (Audio) tracks to my hard drive. After  that, I use the Holy Roses program called Encode-Handheld-5.3 to encode the program to an M4V Apple TV format. I haven't used Handbrake for quite a while now. I use a program called Subler to mux in my Dolby Digital 5.1 and I use a program called Jubler for all my subtitles (.srt)   Encode-Handheld is a command-line program for Mac and Linux......I was trained by Poppedtart on how to use it... Hope this helps

 thx for your feedback"

You can use Subler to add the artwork to the file after its encoded. I add all my artwork with Encode-Handheld thru a command line. If u need help with that, ket me know"
,mickemus66,2010-11-12T03:46Z,"tnx for the info about how to change the art work on the movie file, well i didnt really have any luck with subler, or i probably didnt do it right and the encode handheld program is prbably alittle to advanced for me LOL, i will give subler another try though"
,mickemus66,2010-11-12T03:50Z,"i even checked out muxo and subler, now to the problem, im running on windows 7 professional, both muxo n subler is for mac so im out of luck
but thanks anyway"

Try using MetaX for the artwork. They should make MetaX for windows as well."
,mickemus66,2010-11-16T19:22Z,"thanks for all the great software info, im now using the Moyea Blu-Ray Ripper and its great and to tag it the MetaX is working great, excellent softwares and info from you many kudos n tnx"
