Metallica, informally known as The Black Album, is the fifth album by the American heavy metal band Metallica, released August 13, 1991 through Elektra Records. The album features songs that are considered today as Metallica's most well-known tracks, with songs such as Enter Sandman, The Unforgiven, Nothing Else Matters , Wherever I May Roam and Sad but True. It spent four consecutive weeks at number one on Billboard 200. Metallica is the band's best-selling album to date, with over 15 million copies sold in the United States and over 25 million copies worldwide. It is the second best-selling album of the SoundScan era.

While the album and the band were critically praised and commercially successful, some fans expressed disappointment in the new direction taken by Metallica. Gone for the most part were faster staccato riffs during verses and throaty vocals found on the band's first four albums; the overall speed and complexity of the music was somewhat lessened. The Black Album presented a more radio-friendly, commercially accessible Metallica, especially evidenced by the ballad Nothing Else Matters. Moreover, following the success of One, the breakaway single from their Ã¢â‚¬Â¦And Justice for All album, five videos were released from The Black Album. (Enter Sandman, Nothing Else Matters, Sad but True, Wherever I May Roam and The Unforgiven).

Reception

      Rolling Stone (9/5/91) - 5 Stars Ã¢â‚¬â€ Excellent Ã¢â‚¬â€ Included in Rolling Stone's Essential Recordings of the 90's - Several songs...seem destined to become hard-rock classics....[They] effectively bridg[e] the gap between commercial metal and the much harder thrash of Slayer, Anthrax and Megadeth. In 2003, the album was ranked number 252 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.
      Spin (9/99, p. 146) - Ranked #52 in Spin Magazine's 90 Greatest Albums of the '90s - Spin (p. 89) - This record's diamond-tipped tuneage stripped the band's melancholy guitar excess down to melodic, radio-ready bullets and ballads.
      Entertainment Weekly (8/16/91) - Rock's preeminent speed-metal cyclone...Metallica may have invented a new genre: progressive thrash. - Rating: B+
      Q magazine (8/00, p. 127) - Included in Q's Best Metal Albums of All Time - Transformed them from cult metal heroes into global superstars....bringing a little refinement to their undoubted power.
      Melody Maker (12/91) - Ranked #16 in Melody Maker's list of the top 30 albums of 1991 - In a committed move away from their thrash roots, Metallica was slower, less complicated, and probably twice as heavy as anything they'd done before.
