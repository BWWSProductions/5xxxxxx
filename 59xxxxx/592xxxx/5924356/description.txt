Mary Isabel/Isobel Catherine Bernadette O'Brien OBE (16 April 1939 â€“ 2 March 1999), known professionally as Dusty Springfield, was an English singer whose career extended from the late 1950s to the 1990s. She is best known for her work during the 1960s, when she released singles such as "I Only Want to Be with You" (1963), "You Don't Have to Say You Love Me" (1966) and "Son of a Preacher Man" (1968), and her most acclaimed album Dusty in Memphis (1969).
With her distinctive sensual sound, she is an important white soul singer, and at her peak was one of the most successful British female performers, with 18 singles in the Billboard Hot 100 from 1964 to 1970. Her image, supported by a peroxide blonde beehive hairstyle, evening gowns, and heavy make-up, made her an icon of the Swinging Sixties.
