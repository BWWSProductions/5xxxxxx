A series of books instructing from the basics up the fundamentals of machine tools, benchwork, metalworking, electronics, and all the skills and knowledge required to go from an unskilled apprentice to a journeyman machinist and model maker.  However, these skills apply equally well to almost any sized project, be it a small toy / model or doing fabrication and invention.  Each book contains the information and projects to follow which will teach the reader those skills.

Some of books from the series are unfortunately missing in the torrent.  I've tried to hunt them down, both online, in the library, and to purchase.  As I find them, I'll put them up for DL so watch my other torrents in you are interested in this series or comment on any you particularly want/need and I'll see if I can put those toward the top of my work queue.
