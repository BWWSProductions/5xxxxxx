,indiaman,2010-11-03T05:43Z,Thank you das_wookie for this excellent collection of workshop books.Greatly appreciated.
,das_wookie,2010-11-05T14:55Z,"Thanks Bow/India,
I keep trying to provide content for topics I'm interested in and that I see is missing and/or not readily available.

I try and do anything I can to encourage creativity and contribute towards others making things (art, machines, toys, whatever!) for themselves and inspire others to say ""I can do that!"". Especially somebody younger (note, I didn't say KIDS, but it need not be just other old pharts like myself please LOL)

Take this knowledge, spread it around, and inspire others as well! Show others how to make things with THEIR own hands, and inspire them to teach others as well!"

I've got the 4 prior Darrel Holland lathe vids (as well as his Milling series), but I'll have to DL these latest ones you just put up and replace my existing copies. I hope to have some similar exciting stuff to post soon as well...  stay tuned. :)"

,Magnus08,2011-08-14T13:32Z,several pages are missing from the beginning of book 3
,das_wookie,2011-08-21T19:34Z,"@Magnus08: What pages do you think are missing? I just re-verified the master files and they are all there. Perhaps you have a bad download, or are not counting the pages which are just not numbered? Not sure so am having to guess here. The MD5SUM of the PDF should be as follows:
09865f0c012f95512d661af48cfd3a2c  Workshop Practice Series/03 - Screwcutting In The Lathe.pdf
So if you have a different MD5, you've got a bad DL."
