http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=174

Jadis is led by Gary Chandler (vocals, electric guitar), although generally the whole group is given songwriting credit. Other original members of the band were Trevor Dawkins (bass), Pete Salmon (keyboards) and Paul Alwin (drums), who was replaced by Mark Law in July 1988. Later members were Martin Orford (keyboards), John Jowitt (bass) and Steve Christey (drums). Orford and Jowitt are also members of IQ.

In the late 1990s, Orford and Jowitt left the band for a while and were replaced by Mike Torr (keyboards) and Steve Hunt (bass), but they returned for 2000's Understand. Shortly after completing their album Photoplay in early 2006, Orford left the band for a second time due to musical differences. He was replaced with Italian session pianist/keyboardist Giulio Risi. In late 2006, Jowitt also left the band again, and was replaced with session player Andy Marlow for some live gigs.
