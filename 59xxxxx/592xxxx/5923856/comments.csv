The person who upload the Jadis discography converted all the album songs into one .ape file. Once I decompress them, they are all one file for burning to a CD. Problem is, who in the hell burns CD's anymore, with MP3 players in the marketplace?"

So, to all you foul-mouthed, limp wristed w*nkers who like to leave shite comments, wake up and smell the coffee - you're getting this for FREE. Well done zibbik - thank you for uploading some great music."
