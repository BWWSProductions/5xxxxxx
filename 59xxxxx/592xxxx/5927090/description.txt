The Nashville born singer appeared amidst a whirlwind of
praise at the start of 2010 with her stunning first offering,
the critically acclaimed Dead Flowers EP. Own Side Now is
sheer perfection, drawing further on her love for the female
greats such as Linda Ronstadt and Stevie Nicks (Fleetwood
Macs Thats Alright gets a delightful airing here) as well
as those from a pure country lineage such as Patsy Cline, and
firmly places her in the same league. Dead Flowers showed the
budding of a ripe talent, but this time around she has a seriously
talented full band to assist in elevating own side now into a
different class. Although steeped in the country tradition,
Caitlins music is not constrained by that heritage. Own Side now
was produced by Mark Nevers (Lambchop, Andrew Bird).
