As he was reading, he stopped and reached over to his wife and started fondling her pussy. He did this only for a very short while then stopped and went back to reading his book.

The wife got up and started stripping in front of him. The husband was confused and asked, ""What the hell are doing, taking all your jammies off?"" The wife replied, ""You were playing with my pussy. I thought it was foreplay for
something a bit heavier"".

The husband said, ""Hell no! I was just wetting my fingers so I could turn the pages."
