Illuminatus! Part I
The Eye in the Pyramid

Performed by: Ken Campbell
& Chris Fairbank
Audio Length: 13 hours
Category: Unabridged Fiction
Format: 32kbps MP3 

\"It was the year when they finally immanentized the Eschaton.\" And so begins the original and genuine trilogy of conspiracies, Illuminatus!. For the first time in audiobook form, Deepleaf Audio presents the unabridged Trilogy in all its grandeur, spookiness, hilarity and brilliance.

Part I - The Eye in the Pyramid was performed by the incomparable Ken Campbell and Chris Fairbank, and broadcast live in London on ResonanceFM in June 2006. In 1976, Ken Campbell adapted Illuminatus! for the stage - a 10 hour epic which went on to open the Royal National Theatre in London under the patronage of Her Majesty Elizabeth II. Chris Fairbank played Simon Moon, among other characters, in the Campbell production which included Jim Broadbent, Bill Nighy, David Rappoport and Bill Drummond. 30 years and 23 Fernando Poos since Ken and Chris first breathed life into Shea and Wilson\'s masterpiece and Illuminatus! seems even more startlingly relevant and chock full of laughter than ever before. Enjoy the Trips!

WHAT OTHERS SAY

â€œWhat we have is a cross between a literary acid trip and a political tour de farce.â€ â€“Playboy

\"An epic fantasyâ€¦a devilish funny work, loaded with humor, puns up-level ironies that make you burst out laughing (if you arenâ€™t frightened by them), wordplay, and camp characters. It shimmers with illusion and paradox that prove delight after magical delightâ€¦a jolting theater of the absurd that draws the audience into the play, farcical black tragicomdey that turns out to have been written by you and meâ€¦. If you want to read a riddle wrapped in an enigma within a conundrum that turns out to be the best secret in the world, get the Illuminatus! trilogy. It strips away illusion.â€ â€“ John White, New Age Journal

â€œA fairy tale for paranoids.â€ â€“ Epicine Wildblood *

â€œâ€¦one of the most amusing, most imaginative fantasies to come along in a whileâ€¦Illuminatus! horses around with the conspiracy theory of history:  through secret sects, political movements, saviors, religion, historical characters, drugs, sex, government and just about every other institutionâ€¦. Spaced out, erotic, funny, masterlyâ€¦the nth degree of surrealismâ€¦. Readers will love the whole psychedelic puzzleâ€¦â€ â€“ Publishers Weekly

WHAT OTHERS SAY

\"If baseball can have a designated hitter, why can\'t science fiction have a designated underground classic? Well, apparently it can, and Illuminatus! is its name.\"  â€“ Booklist

â€œThe ultimate conspiracy bookâ€¦the biggest sci-cult novel to come along since Dune. Based on the actual incarnations of the mystic Illuminati sects, which include the Hashisi, the  Knightes Templars, and the Masons, among others, the novel ties together everything youâ€™ve ever dreaded about Watergate, the Mafia, UFOs, all the recent political assassinations, Atlantis, Naxi Germany, giant rock festivals, the CIA, pyramid power, John Dillinger, LSD, yoga, the FBI, and the last words of Dutch Scutz â€“ for starters â€“ in a hilariously raunchy style.â€ â€“  The Village Voice

\"Funny, savagely sarcastic, definitely anarchisticâ€¦wild and irreverentâ€¦(Shea and Wilson blend) a marvelous amount of fact and inspired fiction (together to weave) one of the most dizzying tales Iâ€™ve come across in yearsâ€¦. Laugh or rage at it or with itâ€¦you wonâ€™t be able to put it down.â€ â€“ Fred Pooj, Limit

Illuminatus! Part III cheerfully ushers in the apocalyptic high-camp conclusion of the Illuminatus! Trilogy. The 9th and 10th Trips are performed by a grand ensemble cast. The Appendices (which are most instructive) are performed by the incomparable Ken Campbell, bringing the audiobook trilogy full circle.

WHAT OTHERS SAY

\"This book\'s as freaked out as the come and a gas of a read.\"  â€“ Publisher\'s Weekly

\"The longest shaggy joke in literary historyâ€¦. A hundred pages in I couldnâ€™t figure out why I was wasting my time with this nonsenseâ€¦after three hundred I was having too much fun to quit, and by the end I was eager to believe every word  â€“ even if the only conspiracy at work here is Shea and Wilsonâ€™s devilish exploitation of our need to made ordered sense out of everything under the sunâ€¦. I loved it.\" â€“ Greil Marcus, Rolling Stone

â€œAll the ingredients: kinky sex, raunchy language, and a fantasy plot that oscillated between a schizoid nightmare and a psychedelic dream.\" â€“  Booklist

â€œâ€¦akin to some of the work of Thomas Pynchonâ€¦Illuminatus! is one of the great American satires.â€ -- Berkeley Barb
