,lorum,2010-10-31T11:06Z,"I would never buy this plane and this Lancair IV-P is 396 MB!, this plane cost 29,95 euros...totally insane price, because this could be freeware.

The Orbx Team should making scenery not plane.

,Jimstalk,2010-10-31T15:25Z,Thanks for uploading !!!Btw i agree with lorum.the price is exactly the same with the md 80 from CLS...The cockpit is pretty cool but its a 4 SEATER aircraft.Imagine a well made a380 from ORBX.How much would it cost??150 euros???xD.Again thanks for uploading this.Its pretty nice for bush flying!!
,sidewinderv2.0,2010-10-31T17:10Z,"Thanks for the upload! I've always loved the lines of this plane.

@lorum: It's insane how expensive most developers planes are. I know we're getting better graphics and detail but you really wonder why it has to be so much. I can't wait to see how much PMDG has its 737NG come out to be."
,FRANKFKA,2010-10-31T17:37Z, thanks man...
,Jimstalk,2010-10-31T17:38Z,"@sidewinderv2.0

The pmdg 737 ngx is said to be the most accurate and realistic payware addon ever made for the FS.I dont care for his price.I would spend 80 euros for it and me none will be able to crack it.PMDG has changed the security system and from now cracking their software will be impossible....Type in google:''PMDG 737 ngx pictures (or photos) and have a look at some ""very first"" as they say photos from the cockpit!!!"

and it was also said the titanic was unsinkable...."
,Lord_Graphite,2010-11-01T04:37Z,Well spoken cat. People that worship the developers have no business on TPB. 
,useless_leacher,2010-11-01T12:42Z,"I'm guessing no-one would spend two years developing a freeware plane to hear some toss-wit 13 year olds argue about how much it should cost, while they download a torrent.

Still, if you are incapable of making anything yourself .. I guess you may as well just download other people's stuff.

,jager963,2010-11-03T15:50Z,Nice plane and thanks for uploading whoever you are. Why are some of you bitching about the price when if your on here your clearly paying nothing for it. Well worth the money i didnt have to spend on it i thought :)
,crashbandit,2010-11-03T18:02Z,Many thanks for this share. Especially since this is the only recent upload that is actually new and not months old ware from the sadly deceased WoS.
,rrodger99,2010-11-03T22:35Z,"Gotta agree...how many times did I buy add ons that didn't deliver what they promised...

I don't often request add ons but if anyone has the KCLT scenery for FSX & would post it, I would greatly appreciate it."
,ActiveSky,2011-01-01T21:52Z,thnak you!!
