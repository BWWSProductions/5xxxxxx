Star Wars Comics 1 - 4.

Classic Star Wars was an expansive comic book series published 
by Dark Horse that re-released several hard-to-find Star Wars 
comics, including the daily Star Wars comic strip by Archie 
Goodwin and Al Williamson, as well as several from the Marvel 
Star Wars series of the 70s and 80s. The entire series was 
published from 1992 to 2003.

The events in Classic Star Wars take place between the first 
and second Star Wars films, and each issue is jam-packed with 
action. Our debut issue is no exception: Luke and Leia embark 
on a scouting mission, are pursued by Imperial troops, and 
fall into the clutches of a bounty hunter whose real target 
is Han Solo! Whew! The whole shebang is written by Archie 
Goodwin, drawn by Al Williamson, and colored by Steve 
Buccellato, with a new cover by Williamson.
