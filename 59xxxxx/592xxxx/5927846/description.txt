    Riese, a seemingly random wanderer, is being hunted by a terrifying religious cult, The Sect. Traveling from     nation to nation for years, she is accompanied only by a wolf, Fenrir. Together they must evade the     assassins sent by the Sect - who'll stop at nothing to complete the task they failed to achieve many years     ago. Her past is shrouded in mystery, as even Riese can't recall the events of the tragic night when her     entire family was slaughtered and she was forced to flee into the wilderness. On her journey, she'll piece     together her past, and her destiny, in a conflict that will hold the fate of the world in the balance - and     the once peaceful kingdom of Eleysia will be the battlefield. "Riese", a unique and original steam-punk -    inspired production includes Christine Chatelain ( SyFy's Sanctuary , Supernatural, The Collector, The L-    Word ). Ben Cotton (Harper's Island, Stargate: Atlantis, Stan Helsing), Sharon Taylor (Stargate: Atlantis,     Alice and Huck) and Patrick Gilmore (Stargate: Universe, Battlestar Galactica, Intelligence).
