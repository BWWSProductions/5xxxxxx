The music is good, old-fashioned hard rock, and the lyrics are straight on to God.
Anyway.LIAISON is a Christian AOR band formed by brothers Larry and Tim Melby. Dann Huff of GIANT fame supplied additional guitar work to the Bill Baumgert produced 1989 debut. TOTO drummer Jeff Porcaro also contributes as does renowned session guitarist MICHAEL LANDAU. For the 1990 \'Urgency\' album LIAISON used the services of guitarist Glen Pierce and drummer Doug Matthews. This new duo were both out of the picture by the time of the 1992 \'Hard Hitter\' record, their places filled by bassist Kelly Burns and drummer Tim Jones. Guests were in evidence in the form of HOUSE OF LORDS guitarist Lanny Cordola, STRYPER guitarist Oz Fox and DAVID LEE ROTH band drummer Gregg Bissonette.Remember Diason? Two brothers Larry and Tim Melby who made a couple of goodish heavy rock/AOR albums through Word here before disappearing from high profile CCM attention. Well, they\'re still around and rocking and this 1995 album shows they\'ve lost none of their grit. The opener Two Tracks\" I\'Am Really\"Glad I\'m Here\" cranks up a fearsome riff reminding me slightly of early White Heart while the ballad \"Do What Is Good\" has an attractive lilting production.
