,jenchai,2011-05-31T13:33Z,"Thanks bobnjeff, your 1080p Bourne movies are the best.

maxneb has a crappy audio of 256k where you have 1500 DTS.

One of Ltt has been informed as audio syncronisation of 200ms.

Thanks !!! "
,jenchai,2011-05-31T13:35Z,"@edo003, these are 1080p 8gb file size. the amount  of RAM and processor speed has to be too high to be able to play on computer. these files are for to play on TV. 

Use WDTV Media Player."
