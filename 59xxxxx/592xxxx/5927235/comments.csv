[T],FatFreddy69,2010-11-02T02:29Z,"More correctly the source is...
and rared and  not subtitled and didn't see it seeded on the open trackers. wha'ever..
why don't you mind your own torrents instead, your comments are all over the net showing off how important you are.."
[V],-jonny-,2010-11-02T12:56Z,"You've got issues. I was helping, and I was correct. Don't be a prick."
,RDeadOne,2010-11-17T03:48Z,Hardcoded subtitles.

You either take the piss or don't know how to switch between subs because you're either to lazy to read the instructions of your player of you're too ""thick"" to understand. If you keep doing this your account will be deleted. You did the same in these torrents bellow;

Hundreds have downloaded these 3 torrents and you are the only one saying this.

Subtitles are NOT Hard-coded!"
,loquorlicker,2010-11-26T21:29Z,why are you being such a defensive asshole?
,mrosebro,2010-12-01T05:41Z,"@loquorlicker

i created an account just to throw this punch line out there...  *takes deep breath* ... because dumb people are fucking aggrivating!  =D"
,roadrunnerside8,2010-12-01T06:50Z,@mkvonly Thanks man I really appreciate the bandwidth you spent uploading this. =)

You need to WRITE that this is a re-encode of another one's genuine BR rip! When you don't, you're pissing off a lot of bandwidth from people downloading this thinking it's a genuine rip, then realizing the crap quality that it is and having to delete it again, only the try and find a genuine rip.

For those not wanting to waste time downloading this re-encoded thing, the genuine rip is here:

,buzzmeupplz,2010-12-04T20:20Z,"you guys need to realize  that %99 of the small hd rips are all re-encodes of other releases ifyou download a 2g 720p rip thinking it isnt a re-encode thn youare an idiot, not the person who upped it"
,r0ttiem0m,2010-12-21T02:41Z,Thanks so much for upping this CLASSIC!!!! 
,sweaterpuppies1,2011-08-16T04:52Z,"This isn't the 720p release by DIMENSION.

,AmishNick,2011-11-27T15:43Z,"Thank you mkvonly! =)

lol, I too registered to respond to the idiotic negative comments on here.  

#1) this is by far the most active torrent for this movie, for over a year now, and it has +7 rating

#2) If you have no torrents of your own uploaded, then it'd be proper to make polite suggestions/requests to those kind enough to upload and see torrents, not demands @kickasswashingmachine"
,jolly83,2011-11-29T08:21Z,"@mkvonly  Thank You!  Great Quality!  Could you PLEASE post ""Santa Clause Is Coming To Town"" in HD?   Or could anyone point me that direction?"
,anchoita,2011-12-01T17:12Z,"Sorry to all you tech-savvy folks, i'm new at this and not sure whether to spend the time downloading this. 
Can my VLC play this if i don't have a blu-ray player? (feeling a bit duh here)"
