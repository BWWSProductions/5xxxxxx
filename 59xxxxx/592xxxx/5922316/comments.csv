,c_moore47102,2010-10-30T20:32Z,This song is not found on the iTunes store and took me days to find for free on some no-name site. I visited Germany on a student exchange back in 2007 and my exchange student loved E-Nomine and this in particular became my favourite. The quality is flawless and the music style is really interesting.
