DEFINITIONS | 412, Sister Dee  +  Pics

412 is one block headed bitch. Sister Dee has decided that a crate is a powerful tool for intimidation. The box she uses to black out the world for 412 is simple, but effective. Inside is pitch black, and while sounds from outside are muffled and indistinct they echo around the chamber. 412 can barely think inside. Her own breath makes the confines even more uncomfortable. Every time she exhales the space becomes just a bit warmer, more humid and less comfortable. Getting out of that tight space is supposed to be a blessing but things turn sour quickly.
