This is a high quality, full resolution, high profile h264 dvd rip of Farscape - Season 4.  These files may be a little large for some.  But if you aren't worried about space, and want a higher quality, then this is for you.  I've watched the episodes and they look and sound great on my 50 inch lcd/surround sound system.
