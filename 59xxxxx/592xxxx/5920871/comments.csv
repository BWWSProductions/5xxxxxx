Some of my other sci-fi torrents include high quality complete series of: Star Trek Next Generation, Star Trek DS-9, Stargate SG-1, and Space Above and Beyond.

Star Trek Voyager is currently being ripped.  The first season should be up soon."
,pandit12,2010-11-04T07:48Z,"Dear Meech

Is StarTrek Enterprise also on your list ?"
,Shoobox,2010-11-26T23:40Z,StarTrek Enterprise would def be great to view in your great quality conversions.
,ONeg,2011-02-20T08:29Z,"First time I got a whole series in HD. Wouldn't have expected it to be a sci-fi show. Wouldn't have expected it to be a 10-year-old one.

Kudos."
[V],meech,2011-03-19T03:07Z,"Just to clarify.  These are not technically HD rips.  i.e. the resolution is not 720p or higher (hi-def).  However, they are high quality (regular) dvd rips.  They were ripped with good high profile x264 settings and given a little extra size for more bitrate as well.  I just didn't want there to be any confusion.  Though that is a good mistake to make as far as I'm concerned.  That must hopefully you mean you like the quality.  Glad you are enjoying the show :-)"
,Grand-Grimoire,2011-09-25T07:27Z,awsome i love this show...thanks...will seed
,riplikethat,2011-11-01T17:15Z,"You use ""HD"" with 720p+ rips. Not with DVD rips. DVD rips are just DVD rips.

This torrent is good but lack of widescreen is a major annoyance.. and it no way looks that good on large monitors to be called ""HD"".

Either way, it is taking forever to download anything in this torrent cause of shitty seeders."
,riplikethat,2011-11-01T17:16Z,PS: I wasn't saying that meech called this torrent HD. I was replying to ONeg. :P
,firebred,2012-05-09T17:29Z,"@MEECH,
Just wanted to express my sincere gratitude for these HQ Farscape torrents.  All seasons.

From what I've read in your comments for all 4 it just seemed you were receiving some flack for petty crap and it irritated me. I was surprised b/c I was amazed w/ how AWESOME these looked!  

I have a Dell Mini w/1GB of RAM (yeah I know shut up lol) so I cannot watch HD versions of ANYTHING b/c my system can't handle it. As a result I am forced to settle for lower quality versions and I hate it.  So when I found these and saw that they ACTUALLY were playable even for ME and looked so crisp in comparison, especially to what I'm used to, I was ECSTATIC! 

I'm new to torrents so forgive me for sounding like a newbie but I wanted to see if there was anyway you would share w/me HOW to produce torrents w/ the same quality you've displayed w/ these? I wouldn't ask if it wasn't that your versions are the ONLY ones (of ANY video files) I have yet to come across that have such quality but are playable for me. This is a happy medium btwn BR-HD copies I cannot play and LQ-DVD versions I'm normally stuck with. If you're willing to share I can't tell you how much I would appreciate it. And it would also help me give back to the community since I'm brand spankin' new as of today. :)

Either way thanks for these MEECH! Seriously. (oh n sorry for the mini novel of a cmnt lol)"
,firebred,2012-05-09T17:39Z,"*Clarification To Above:
I guess my question isn't as much about how to make the actual torrent file as it is about how to create a HQ video file (MKV or whtever) the exact way you did w/these. To achieve the same effect w/my video files I currently own. Thx hopefully! ^_^"
