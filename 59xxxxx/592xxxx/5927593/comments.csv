,citizendonny,2010-11-02T04:10Z,"it won't be long before this serial # is blacklisted. Every time I dl this app, it is not long before it is black listed."
,j2progeny,2010-11-02T13:06Z,itz ok... sooner or later there will have keygens coming out here in TPB.. no worries
[V],DeGun,2010-11-02T13:07Z,"Even if serial is blacklisted IT DOESNT MATTER just make sur :

first you used nero remove/clean tools to uninstal any previous version of nero .

REFUSE PROGRAM to connect to internet once you re asked for serial... then it will always work . 
I dont take this upload but thx for sharing , by the way BLACKTROY some more usefull comments/details inside your torrents would be highly appreciated ."

,mcrobbie,2011-02-02T23:45Z,"Recently Installed Windows 7 so no Nero traces on my system...
Installed with serial but when importing any file, eg- Movie Maker, (Vision), Patend/Purchase pops up, tried the 2nd serial below via Fax option, same... Seems the writer is the only operational tool...
Please correct me if Im wrong but it appears to be a waste of time and bandwidth, (over 3 gigs), not forgetting its the latest version using a serial not a patch etc...
Seems a good rule is to stick with trusted uploaders youre familiar with, no offense to BLACKTROY, being my first using his/hers/them..."

,mcrobbie,2011-02-03T00:26Z,"Ps - went to un-install it through add and remove, there was at least 20 entries, went with system restore, successful, donât see any remnants in the system, thanks and babyeâŚ

,sniper007,2011-03-12T17:23Z,"Hi guys Can anyone please give mp3 pro plugin Serial for Nero 10.5.10500. Thanks in advance!

I tried a lot serial for mp3 pro plugin but none of them worked!"
,God2010,2011-03-28T00:35Z,"Thanks BLACKTROY. Works great for me in windows 7. No problem with Nero vision or anything. The Keys are working perfectly. I made 2 test DVDs. One movie and one slideshow. Those who have problem with patent activation is coz they allowed nero to access internet. while on installation after asking if you want to install Ask tool bar and stuff, disconnect net, and block nero accessing net in future using your firewall. then everything is perfect. please dont blame the uploader for your fault."
,God2010,2011-03-28T00:37Z,"Those who have problem with keys and activation, please uninstall and reinstall as in the ablove comment. I am sure it will work perfectly."

,pezed,2011-04-25T09:38Z,Installed ok for me but Nerovision and Nero Recode are not working everything else is working fine. When Nerovision say's patent activation and even trying to burn a data movie file only a a few movies from my library show up. I had my computer totally disconnected until I was able to block it and I even made a rule for Nero. I'll give it another try.
,MasterFasterVDOWN,2011-05-16T08:16Z,"From what I saw using google search engine:
Indeed there are 2 cracks by kindly // ru-board

AdvrCntr5.v2.0.8.2.Kindly.Edition.v1.3.for.Nero.10 (for 10.5)

AdvrCntr5.v2.0.9.10.Kindly.Edition.v1.0.for.Nero.10.6

But you also need working serials (non blacklisted I suppose).

I have not tested these cracks, as I don't need them. I'm using another software (and free).

I'm sorry that I cannot upload a torrent for the above cracks. I don't have them and I'm quit from this stuff.

Either use google.com to search for them or wait for someone else to upload them or better buy Nero if you use it that much. "
,downaccs,2011-06-23T18:21Z,"just show 'invalid' serial after online verification when i click 'convert', i can't stop it, is a 'must' process!

,McGunt,2011-10-22T19:31Z,"Thanks in advance. Already using a version of this but will try if it's the full retail. I was stupid enough to actually pay for a full retail version of Nero 9, but despite getting all correct serials & activation from Nero -- IT DIDN'T WORK!!!

,PhiberOptix,2011-10-27T19:38Z,"Anybody tried adding

127.0.0.1 nero.com
127.0.0.1 http://www.nero.com
127.0.0.1 activate.nero.com
127.0.0.1 http://www.activate.nero.com

to their hosts file? I guess that should do the trick..."
,PhiberOptix,2011-10-27T19:39Z,"Oops. That should be

127.0.0.1 nero.com
127.0.0.1 activate.nero.com

Never mind the http stuff. I'm just messing with you. ;)"
,PhiberOptix,2011-10-27T19:42Z,"M-mm, here is what I found on another torrent:

1. Run and Install Nero_PlatinumHD-10.5.10900.exe

 2. Go to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\ and open the hosts file with Notepad.

 3. Add the following to the bottom of the text;
 127.0.0.1 nero.com
 127.0.0.1 www.nero.com
 127.0.0.1 activate.nero.com
 127.0.0.1 www.activate.nero.com 
 127.0.0.1 activation2.nero.com

 4. Save the file. Make sure that you are overwriting the file and not saving it a a seperate file e.g. hosts.txt. Also make sure to make the file read-only afterwards.

 5. Windows Key + R, type msconfig and press Enter. Click on the Services tab then uncheck 'Nero Update' and then click OK.

 6. Disconnect your internet (recommended but may be optional)

 7. Launch Nero StartSmart 10. Enter the key:
 KK00-5195-199K-254K-132E-9056-XC07
 followed by
 9X03-014M-337H-H1CZ-L2KK-229X-1ZUX-LPHA

 8. Reconnect internet if you had disconnected it and the Nero products should work."
