,oceanpanda,2010-11-07T07:44Z,"Pretty sure that the song MANIAC is fucked. If you're not too old of age you can hear a very high pitch sound that doesn't feel good on your ears. Almost like that mosquito sound but it isn't a constant ringing. If this is part of the song than KiD CuDi definitely fucked up, cause it makes such a sick song horrible to listen to. "
,oceanpanda,2010-11-07T07:46Z,"^ Not trying to hate, just letting you know.

Thanks for the upload, NoFS dominates."

,.TakaM,2011-01-19T14:31Z,"Hey, you wait stop.

I know you're reading this to check if you should toke up before listening to this for the first time, the answer is fuck yes.
Come on, you're downloading this album and you already know it's awesome, at least pay him the respect of toking it up and taking each song like a shot straight to the dome.

If you're dry at the moment seriously, wait until you restock.. shiiiit, there's a track called MARIJUANA and you already know it's 4:20 long."
