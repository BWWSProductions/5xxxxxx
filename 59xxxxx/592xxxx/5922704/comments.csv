Not very good comresion. There are a bunch of pixels freezing in almost every frame, which is very anoying.
I'll wait for better one."

,tomcat2014,2010-11-14T13:50Z,"Just wanted to add that it uses a high number of Reframes in it's x264 encoding (14), so it has higher quality but won't play properly on some older systems."
