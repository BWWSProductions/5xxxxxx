BBC A History of Horror 1of3 PDTV x264 AAC MVGroup 2010

Series in which Mark Gatiss celebrates the greatest achievements of horror cinema.

Part 1: Frankenstein Goes to Hollywood.
He begins by exploring the golden age of Hollywood horror, from the late 1920s until the 1940s, the era of Lon Chaney, Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff. Mark explains just how daring and pioneering these films were, and traces how horror pictures evolved during this period, from camp and subversive to dark and perverse, before a final flourish with the psychological horror of RKO Pictures' films.
