Also, there are no track names/artist names etc. for any tracks."
,Oruc_Reis,2010-11-06T19:03Z,"Actually, the glitches happen quite frequently in some songs, making them quite difficult to enjoy. Anyone found a torrent without these glitches?"

With regards to the actually tracks most of them are crap.  Disappointed with this volume tbh."
