,dardar6t9,2010-11-02T08:49Z,Can you tell me why I cant seperate the files? I'm using 7.1 bit torrent. It opens up a block of the files but when I click on them I get a standard(print/add to favourites....all that crap) I'm just a carpenter. But this is doing my head in? You talk down to ppl like u are some sort of omnipreicsnt.........U arent....ur a wanker with a keyboard.........20/40 u are so full of ur self....I hope when u need a plumber or any tradesman that they rip u off and tell u its raining gold
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-02T09:50Z,"@dardar6t9: In lower part of the program window you'll see Tabs: ""Files"". Click on it. Click on specific torrent in upper part of the program window. All files which are in that torrent would appear in lower, previously opened ""Files"" Tab. Then do right-click with the mouse on files you don't want and choose from small drop-down menu which wold pop-up - ""Don't download"". You'll see how specific file has changed status to ""Skipped"".
That's all. Percentage bar would be made up to the new size for download - it isn't full content anymore.
You can seed after you've finished downloading just by leaving torrent active - of course, you would give and share with others just the files you have downloaded - it's OK, but please, seed back and share as much as you can.

Also, bookmark and read many times

wold = would

Sorry."
,dardar6t9,2010-11-02T11:26Z,thank you....wasn't that easier than being condescending?
,dardar6t9,2010-11-02T11:42Z,Nup....still nothing....I will just download the larger files off other ppl.....the way they are giving away gb for free these days (shrug) who cares...getting 230gb p/mth for $40......dilligaf
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-02T12:19Z,"@dardar6t9: I hoped that you'll learn something - about my ""style"" and understand a fact that there is a fat reason why you are a plumber and I ""talk down to ppl like u are some"". 
You came to me, man, I haven't called anybody to fix the sewer. 
Anyway, it isn't the point and I have right reasons to believe that explaining even something simple in ""special"" cases as this one - is a waste of time.

I experienced that many many times and I am OK with that. Some people are beyond any help.

Now, crawl back in your dark place and live in conviction that I am ""a wanker with a keyboard.........20/40 u are so full of ur self."" and you are ""plain and simple man"". LOL."
