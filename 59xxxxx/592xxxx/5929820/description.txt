ENCODER'S NOTE:
ok so source's used where russian cam & imagines line audio (thanks to both of ya)
so i deinterlace on a low setting,
i changed the colours using a RGB eq,
i then used a smooth filter (i didnt know weather to use it or not as it made it look good far away but worse up close. so in the end i decided to use it.)
after that i changed the saturation and intensity.
then i changed the brigtess & contrast,
shortly after i decided to use a sharpener on low settings (now i know it may seem weird using a smoother and a sharpener but trust me, it made it look better)
as i was reading imagines notes they said they resized it to give it a 0.1% AR error instead of its original 0.8% AR error
so i finaly decide to re-size using the same resolution as them, Enjoy :)
