Part 3: The American Scream.
Mark Gatiss concludes his celebration of horror cinema by exploring the American films of the late 1960s and 70s which dragged horror kicking and screaming into the present. With their contemporary settings and uncompromising content, films like Night of the Living Dead and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre remain controversial, but Mark argues that these films have much to offer. He gets the inside story from a roster of leading horror directors, including George A Romero, Tobe Hooper and John Carpenter.
