i take back apologies

you are nothing but an ignorant, supercilious little prick with nothing better to do than try to denounce authentic and working quality torrents

you have commented on several uploads, not just mine, and tried to demean them.

you have been denounced several times for the insidious wanker you truly are

have a nice day"
,g8aso,2010-11-01T18:38Z,"It is OK, you need to use Medieval Cue Splitter (Free), but it would be of much more use to the average user, and to me, who only needs 6 or 7 tracks, if it were uploaded conventionally.

We would't have to put up with idiotic comments from the 'hard of thinking' either! "
