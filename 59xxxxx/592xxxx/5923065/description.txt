Shakin' Stevens - Hits and More (2003) (3CD Boxset)
Label: Sony | FLAC lossless-image +cue +log +Booklet/Scans | 870 Mb
Genre : Rock, Pop Rock, Rock & Roll

One of the linchpins of the British rock & roll revival of the 1970s and 1980s, Shakin' Stevens ranks among the most persistent performers ever to emerge ultimately as a superstar. Stevens has no less than 30 U.K. Top 40 hits to his name, almost all of them racked up during one single five-year span of chart invincibility. Yet his recording career predated his first hit by over a decade, struggling through a period that might have forced any less committed artist to simply abandon all hope.
