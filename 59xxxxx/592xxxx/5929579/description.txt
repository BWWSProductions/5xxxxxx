This is my first attempt at a torrent. I hope someone enjoys it.

Description:

The movie that changes everything

Once, they called it the City of Angels. Over time, it has become the City of Lost Souls.

Ten strangers entangle themselves in the spider web that is life in Los Angeles today. Unknowingly, they are living out the Ten Commandments one by one. As they struggle to solve their problems themselves, things only get worse -- their problems multiply, and spill over into the lives of so many others.

Yet there is one presence that never leaves. One lone voice of love, reason, and compassion in the midst of lives on fire: the great I AM, God Himself. It's the ultimate love story that changes everything.
