,nnj,2010-11-06T00:59Z,"Fantastic movie. If you are looking for pixel porn and a bunch of stupid alien shit blowing up, keep moving. If you are looking for a good story and good acting, this is it."
,haydn70ac,2010-11-07T03:15Z,"WARNING This is not the Disney version. 
I let my 6 year old boy watch it without checking and he had nightmares for over 3 weeks. "
,Sharak23,2010-11-07T05:13Z,"@haydn70ac

 Haha if you were looking for the disney animated version how did you not miss it in the first few minutes of the movie? Your fault for walking out of the room before it even started.

 When I was 8 I saw just 30min of Aliens with sigourney weaver... I had nightmares for a year LOL.  Even at christian camp when they took us up to Indian Village so we could live like apache's and pray as christians I would have dreams of aliens and wake up to the whole camp standing above me trying to wake me up cause Id scream at the top of my lungs.

 They probably thought I was posessed HAHAHAHAHA"
,tugaeye,2010-11-08T02:24Z,"Quality is Great, it have monsters but the movie is a love story mostly. but In the end you will be desapointed:("
,NitLions,2010-11-09T09:20Z,"FUCK YOU Tugaeye!! U fuck yourself and then fuck yourself!! U don't write anything about the end of fucking movies!! Now as soon as I get into the plot I'll know what the director wants me to hope for at the end and I'll know the opposite happens. U have fucked this movie for me and I hope that your computer gains consciousness and wakes up and rapes you for weeks while playing audio that ruins the end of every movie that will come out in the next 5 years!! I seriously doubt that will happen but I can dream!! Thats right, raped by your computer!! "

,Sidroc,2010-11-28T20:49Z,"Roger Ebert's review mentions this has some Spanish dialog as well. 

1. Is there actually a lot of Spanish dialog in this movie?

2. Does this movie come with ""hard"" subs? (I don't see an srt file with this.)

3. Does anyone know a good source for subs which will sync with this version of the movie?

Thank you,
Sid"

Thanks to the Uploader anyway"
,Blackbeard42,2010-12-12T06:04Z,NitLions you are a god!!!!!!!!!!! I think I may have peed a little laughing. PC rape lol. Coming to a porn site in the near future
,maabaa,2010-12-14T06:00Z,"Here goes.
A/V : nothing to say.

Now the movie...
I didn't really know what to expect when DLing this, but it was a good surprise. The ambiance is really nice, the soundscore is really good, and no : it's not independance day, or any kind of high budget shit (good or bad). It's a modest budget movie that managed to do really well. I don't think it's a spoiler to say there is not much interaction with the aliens, just enough to keep the movie interesting.
To wrap it up, if you're looking into holliwood badass budget alien whipping, not for you.
If you're into more ""independant cinema"" and a nice simple story directed well, that's for you."
,Lomedin,2011-01-07T05:23Z,"This seems to be HD at best, rather than BR, so it's not the best quality I've seen. A bit better than a DVDrip perhaps. Not bad in any case.

And, since everybody is treating this like imdb, I'll say that I found the film good overall. I don't get comments like ""It's amazing how low the level has reached"" ?? The level of what? This is not starship troopers nor any of those films for teenagers (no offense) or ""adults"" with IQs of 1 digit."
,Jimmyy92,2011-01-08T03:34Z,"Does anyone else realise there is a clip missing at the end or is it just me? Wikipedia states a different ending to the one I have just watched.

Anyone else?"
,obzy77,2011-11-14T22:19Z,"@Sharak23

With you there mate - Alien was the first movie I watched that gave me nightmares for years. I can remember my Dad coming back from watching it at the cinema - I must've been about five. "
