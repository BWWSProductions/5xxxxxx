In New York City in 2059, someone is pursuing missing gems from a decades-old heistâ€¦someone who's willing to kill for them. Sharp-witted and 
sexy, NYPSD Lieutenant Eve Dallas is used to traveling in the shadowy corners outside the law. And in a future where crime meets cutting-edge technology, she will attempt to track down the diamonds once and for all--and stop the danger and death that have surrounded the jewels for years.
