An autistic 9-year-old boy (Miko Hughes, in an amazing performance) cracks the U.S. government's top-secret code when an unapproved test matrix gets published in a crossword magazine. Naturally, the National Security Agency can't allow anyone to have the key to the code, and unctuous villain Alec Baldwin is willing to end the boy's life to protect the nation.
