This won't affect me capping the MotoGP & F1 on my Sky+ box, but I know there will be next to no chance I'll be able to get a 3G signal up there so I can RDP in to my server and upload it... Basically, I'm saying, the upload will be a few days late next week... :("
,NeyborDave,2010-10-31T18:38Z,"TDMK1, you are awesome. I have every race you've posted and it's really the only thing I come here for. Rock the fuck on, good sir."
,VR,2010-10-31T19:37Z,"Thanks for the races, and as far as next week, better late than never!"
,pxpierre,2010-11-01T02:30Z,"tdmk1, I live in Central America & don't have access to BBC's F1 & motogp coverage & I am really grateful for your work.

BIG THANKS!!!"
