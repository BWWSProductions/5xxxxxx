Release notes:

Global Superstar Taylor Swift has solidified her position as one of the most
important artists to emerge on the popular music scene this decade. Since her
self-titled released back in 2006 certified platinum, Taylor has gone on to
break an array of records worldwide with subsequent releases. Her last record
'Fearless' reached double platinum status in the US after its release and was
the year's biggest US debut for any female artist. With her new single 'Mine'
due for release on October 11th already garnering much attention, 'Speak Now'
will clearly be no exception to her success. Swift's lyrical efforts have often
been described as 'autobiographical' therefore she chose to express full writing
credit for the new record alongside Nathan Chapman serving as co-producer.

Already, 'Mine' took the number 1 spot on Billboard's Hot Digital Songs Chart
just four days after its release. With the historic debut of 'Mine', Taylor
joins Mariah Carey as the only female artists in the history of the Billboard
Hot 100 Chart to debut more than one single in the Top 5 in a calendar year.
Taylor is currently nominated for a 2010 MTV Video Music Award for Best Female
Video.
