The Wages of Fear [1953] Fr + Eng subs

Created by Japhson. Bluray source. Language is French, comes with English subtitles. The audio for this rip is in stereo even though it's mono, I only got sound from the left channel when I listened in stereo mode, so you'll want to set your player to mono.
