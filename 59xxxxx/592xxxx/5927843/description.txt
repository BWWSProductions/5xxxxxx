"Call My Name" (2005) is the second song released by Charlotte Church from her fifth album Tissues and Issues. The track Let Me Love You is a cover of a song by the R&B singer Mario and combines lyrics from Jay-Z's '03 Bonnie and Clyde.

Tissues and Issues is the platinum selling fifth studio album by the Welsh singer Charlotte Church released by Sony BMG UK in the United Kingdom on July 11, 2005. Church states that she titled the album Tissues and Issues because "it epitomises teenage problems, which everybody goes through." The album debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number five and was accredited platinum by BPI for sales over 300,000. The album yielded Church four successful top twenty singles; "Crazy Chick", "Call My Name", "Even God" and "Moodswings (to Come at Me like That)".

The album represents a wholly new direction for the singer. Her previous album, Prelude, a 'best of' album, had concluded her classical career; Tissues and Issues is her first pop album.

The first single to be taken from the album, "Crazy Chick", released shortly before the album itself, reached number two on the UK Singles Chart. "Call My Name", the second single, reached number ten in October 2005. "Even God", the third single has debuted in the Top twenty in early December 2005. The fourth single, "Moodswings", was released on February 27, 2006, and peaked at number fourteen on the UK charts.

An early batch of the album had print errors on the right and left hand side title faces. The faces had the title "Charlotte Church : Crazy Chick", when it should have been "Charlotte Church : Tissues and Issues".

Tissues and Issues is Charlotte's last album with Sony Music UK.
