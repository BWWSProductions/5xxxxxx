C'mon.  This is really good stuff.  Seed it!!!!!!"
,terrenmcc,2010-11-02T14:41Z,You gotta be kidding - not seeding even ONE?  Is this some strange joke?  
,terrenmcc,2010-11-07T15:26Z,"This is how it works, captain-chaos:  YOU have to upload at least until several people receive the full torrent and they can take over.  If YOU don't upload they have nothing to share.  They're called seeders, and so would you be, IF YOU UPLOADED!  

Noobs!  "
