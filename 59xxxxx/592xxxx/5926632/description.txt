'Bare Bones' is the eleventh studio album from Canadian rocker Bryan Adams and was recorded during his acoustic 'Bare Bones Tour' in early 2010. The album features re-workings of songs from Adam's extensive back catalogue, stripped back to just vocals and guitar, with the occasional backing by keyboardist Gary Breit. The album captures Adams at his most vulnerable and raw and breathes new life into some of his most popular songs.
