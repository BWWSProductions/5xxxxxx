Secondly: Inception is 2.5 hours long."
,htctouch,2010-10-31T13:25Z,NE BODY HAVE THE IDEA WHEN ITS BLURAY RIP IS COMING ?? because dvd rips dont have that sharpness ass 720P bluray does

The 700mb rips will only have 2 channel 128kb/s (or lower) audio and a much lower video bitrate.

This rip has 6 channel audio at 384kb/s.  

So basically larger sized rips will look and sound better.  Hope that explains it simply enough for ya."
