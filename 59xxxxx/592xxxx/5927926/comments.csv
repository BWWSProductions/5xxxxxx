,hc_baby,2010-11-02T11:56Z,"hey i appreciate the great torrents, but what is the purpose of ripping such a large filesize?? 4.6gb for a game that most people will only watch one time? i have 1mb download speeds  but most people limit their bandwidth while uploading so - it would take me almost aweek to download a file that large so the next week's games will be played before i have a chance to watch.

also, 4.6gb is too large of a filesize for FAT partitions on disk or usb storage.

and mkv format often doesn't play on vlc (most widely used video player)

not hating, but it doesn't do any good to upload files that a lot of people can't use.

just saying..."

Don't wait until after i've already posted it, cuz i've already moved on to other projects. If you need help playing video files, visit suprbay. =)"

ARE YOU HIGH???? I have thousands of MKV files and absolutely every single one of them plays in VLC. And in general stop your whining. High motion HD video takes lots of bits."

But I thought you were going to only watch it once? What on Earth are you doing trying to store it on a FAT32 partition then? Oh do get a clue before posting here!"
