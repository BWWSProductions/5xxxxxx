[V],err0001,2010-11-03T04:05Z,"@grammargeek: 

Thanks for seeding. Not only does it help future uploaders, but it saves my bandwidth so I can upload more shows."
[V],err0001,2010-11-03T04:06Z,"Doh! I mean downloaders, not uploaders. "
,woodstover,2010-11-06T00:54Z,Thanks very much for doing this.  I hope you continue with the future episodes.  Love this show!
,smh5021,2010-11-09T19:29Z,Thank you so much for uploading this series. Seriously. I know no one else who is. 
,smh5021,2010-11-10T03:14Z,"Also, I'm not sure about seeding. I've never done it but I wouldn't mind helping?

Will you be uploading the rest of the season? "
