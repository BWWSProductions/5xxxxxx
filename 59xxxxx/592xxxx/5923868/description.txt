'Bare Bones' is the eleventh studio album from Canadian
rocker Bryan Adams and was recorded during his acoustic
'Bare Bones Tour' in early 2010. The album features re
workings of songs from Adam's extensive back catalogue
stripped back tojust vocals and guitar, with the
occasional backing by keyboardist Gary Breit. The album
captures Adams at his most vulnerable and raw and breathes
new life into some of his most popular songs
