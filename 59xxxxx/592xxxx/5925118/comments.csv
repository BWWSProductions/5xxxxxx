Install:
1) mount SC2 Wings of Liberty 1.0.1 k'ed.dmg and copy the game folder in Applications (it's important to be in this folder).

Now you can play! If you want the last update. Read below.

2) extract s_c_2_update_mac.zip and copy the content for it's folder to ""StarCraft II/Support"" (overwrite).

3) start Starcraft II.app and wait to update (1.1.1) (it takes time). When the button Play is active close the application.

4) load StarCraft II Version 1.1.1 Crack.dmg and start .pkg Ñ„Ð°Ð¹Ð»Ð°. He cracks the game to 1.1.1
5) here are few ways to play the game:

- stop the internet

- move Blizzard Downloader.app and Blizzard Updater.app in other folder

- if you have the program LittleSnitch with her you forbid to SC2.app and Starcraft II.app to connect with ***.battle.net and ***.patch.battle.net. That happens when the game starts - a window will pop-up from LittleSnitch to ask you if the application can connect to internet. You choose only the address and the options and deny.


Multiplayer for now it's not cracked , you can play the campaing. 

If it laggs - low the details from video settings.
Tested on Macbook pro 13"" works fine."

,Tortolini,2010-12-13T11:38Z,"just copy the starcraft folder to applications folder. now you can play (campaign). this includes also some protos missions after playing campaign for a while.

To load you can either start a new campaign and go to menu or you can start a tutorial and load it (which is a little bit faster) in the menu (in game)"

,Blackblades888,2011-10-05T23:18Z,"This torrent works fine, it's only a little inconvenient to load your saved campaign games but otherwise worthwhile. 

***HOWEVER***

The attached skirmish maps (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6091112/Starcraft_2_Skirmish_Maps_._%5BMAC%5D_.) and challenges DO NOT WORK. It will tell you that you need to have an earlier version of Starcraft to load them, and by doing so, will tell you that you cannot load single player games with the Starcraft 2: Starter Edition. Don't ask me why. If by chance this can be solved then I will remove this part of my comment.

But otherwise, worthwhile to play if you like Terran. There is no Zerg in the campaign and only a few Protoss ""missions"""
