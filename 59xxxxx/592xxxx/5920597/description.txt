IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Paranormal Activity 2


Well here we go with a our release of this one...

First we did a small script containing crop,resize,white balance,rgb eq,sharpness,chroma,brightness,contrast......

The source video was very dark so we had to lighten it up a bit to make it more visible. Its a

pretty good cam source for such a dark movie, but turned out good imo. Now the reason for the

READNFO is that our line audio is missing 3 1/2 minutes at the very beginning, so we just

used the cam audio from the LKRG release so thanks to them for that...

Enjoy folks...
