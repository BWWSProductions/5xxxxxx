Last free version of the Limewire filesharing application.

Limewire got shut down by a court order from the music and movie industries, and an injunction prevented them from distributing the client.

Notice was posted on the website, and the download link from the homepage was blocked.  However, due to an oversight, external links to the original download were still active.  That's how this file was obtained.

Since the injunction doesn't prevent anyone else from distributing the program, I've decided to keep Limewire alive for the forseeable future by posting this torrent of the client application.

It came from limewire.com, linked from an external site.  The file is digitally signed by Limewire LLC, so you know it's not a virus or other malware.
It was released by Limewire LLC on September 30, 2010, as version 5.5.16.
