I'm seeding it, so I know that's wrong.
It could be because my account was banned shortly after uploading this the first time, because a mod figured it was a virus, or something.
That's why I posted all the verification stuff in the description, and it may be why it's showing no seeders.  I know a bunch of people downloaded it the first time before I got banned, so it's out there, and you'll get it if you download."
