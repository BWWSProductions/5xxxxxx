,theboobs511,2011-02-12T18:01Z,"download the latest MULTIMAN

,theboobs511,2011-02-13T16:08Z,"sorry i don't know...it works for me with suond on perfectly when i press (select + X)
maybe you should be on kmeaw cfw 3.55"
,theboobs511,2011-02-14T15:58Z,"are you serious?
press O if you don't want to update?"
,-spook-,2011-02-15T11:21Z,No sound. Even with Kmeaw 3.55 and latest multiman v 1.16. Don't bother downloading this unless you enjoy playing games with no sound.
,-spook-,2011-02-17T19:38Z,"@noistalgic

Lucky you then. I have Kmeaw and the latest version of multiman but I don't have any sound. Are you playing from the internal hdd or external?"
,-spook-,2011-02-20T12:43Z,"Ok peeps, I've figured out how to fix the sound problem. You have to update the game manually. Go to http://store.brewology.com/ and install the latest patch. "
,-spook-,2011-02-20T14:48Z,"Another thing, you need to run it from the internal hdd."
,sharath91,2011-02-20T15:23Z,"guys no sound whatsover  .. on internal or external ..    and game freezes after a match .. tried all updates from store.brewology.com
help :)"
,-spook-,2011-02-20T17:02Z,"I'm having the same problem of the game freezing after a match. But the patches and internal hdd seemed to resolve the sound issue. Anyways, this release is nuked. Waste of time people, not a lot of people are getting this to work."
,sharath91,2011-02-20T18:15Z,but in ww.psjcl.com  they have said this game works perfectly with the patch update ....  yeah spook waste of time :)
,-spook-,2011-03-31T20:08Z,That psmods guys posts that shit on every torrent to promote his website. None of his updates are going to fix this game. 
,Shauncold,2011-04-30T01:57Z,I actually rented this game when I first JB my PS3 and couldn't get a backup copy of this game to work. Same problems everybody else is having[no sound after initial launch and game freezes after first match]. It's not the actual download that is messed up as much as I think the game itself is missing something to operate as a backup. Hope that helps{I know not much}. 
,carlo-o,2011-05-01T14:48Z,I still want o play this game.. no fix yet guys?
,Shauncold,2011-07-30T06:00Z,"To get this game to work (even I had problems with the audio) you have to have a newer version of Multiman and when you have the game highlighted, press select and x together at the same time. This SURPRISINGLY does fix the sound in the game.  "
,myfinalfailure,2011-08-12T11:14Z,"Alright fellas... this release does work. Use the latest multiman.. and I mean the LATEST version. And press SELECT+X every time to start the game and the everything will work fine. It will fix the sound issues and game crashes. 

Hope this works for you guys... it worked for me :)

And thanks for the upload consolasatope!"
,Shauncold,2011-08-13T01:26Z,"You don't have to press select+x every time, just the first time you try to run the game. It will be fixed after you do it one time."
,mkane26,2011-10-18T17:29Z, can someone plz tell at wat part xactly should we press select and x to make the audio come plz plz i have been waiting for this game !!!!
,pirate6662012,2011-12-13T14:28Z,explain what to do to make sound work anyone plz
,ramneet,2011-12-20T11:23Z,"guys it works i confirm it. and there is no freezing after a match.
i got it working today only.
the way to make it work is update to the latest multiman an also you have to copy it in an external drive. go into multiman go into game settings(press Triangle, choose game settings) and then select the bd mirror option under the game cover. go back(press O) start the game by pressing X. and also update the game to latest version from brewlogy as spook said."
,ramneet,2011-12-20T11:24Z,and yes sound does not work from internal HDD only Externa drives
