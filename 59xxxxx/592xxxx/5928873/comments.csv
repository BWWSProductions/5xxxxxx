,alcocops,2010-11-28T02:55Z,"I also bought The River when it was first released.
Having heard live versions of some of the songs on bootlegs I was anticipating a classic. Alas, the other tracks were mostly third-rate and marked a decline in quality which The Boss has never entirely managed to regain. I have similar hopes resting on this collection of late 70s out-takes. Will it prove to be a lost classic which could have bridged the gap between Darkness and The River? As ELO once said: Don't Bring Me Down, Brooce!"
