Thanks! Appriciate it! :D"
,Wendy_E,2010-11-03T10:50Z,The audio on this is badly out of sync which is a shame as have been waiting a couple of weeks for this episode to be uploaded along with episode 5.
,PhiberOptix,2010-11-03T17:22Z,"Audio is slightly out of sync, not badly. Still, yes, it is annoying. However, if you'd rather wait until someone else uploads episode 4 of this show, then go ahead.

I think it was kind of you to share this, bewareoblivionisathand. :)"
,bewareoblivionisathand,2010-11-04T18:40Z,"I didn't make the recording, I just uploaded it.
Wish I could find episode 5 too as I can't watch this in the UK. :("
,Wendy_E,2010-11-05T13:59Z,PhiberOptix I do appreciate the upload I was just letting people know the audio is out of sync and as it is at least a minute out of sync I would call that badly not slightly.
,kcbay,2010-11-07T08:26Z,"the audio out of sync isn't too bad, "
,kcbay,2010-11-07T08:27Z,"the audio out of sync isn't too bad, less than 1sec
the video is worse than the normal non HD ones, but that's the only e04 out there
wonder if anyone will do e05, and why Tv team stopped after e03
and history channel's site uses secureflash to safe guard the video file, cannot use normal way to download the file"
,PhiberOptix,2010-11-08T06:22Z,"Wendy_E: If it is ""at least a minute out of sync"" to you I'd suggest using vlc. It is, as kcbay has pointed out, less than a second out of sync.
Annoying, yes, but still watchable. And as this is the only one out there I suggest you read the uploaders note, ""I guess beggars can't be choosers"".
However, you do have the choice of not downloading this video and not watching it.
Uploader has also stated that this is ""crap quality"", you bring nothing new to the game.

So if all you do is troll I'd suggest you do it somewhere else, mkay?"
,sdklfjasd,2010-11-08T08:15Z,there are players out there that will let u easily sync the audio if you give it a little tiny bit of effort
,kcbay,2010-11-09T17:27Z,"the uploader is too hard on himself :)
it is not real ""crap quality"", just it is about SD.
and notice the channel icon, it ain't from the history HD channel with WS like from the TV team, it is from a normal channel (analog?)
I think we all are spoiled by HD/good quality, so we are not used to SD anymore. And this is not a movie anyway"
,Wendy_E,2010-11-12T13:43Z,"Phiber_optix you really are a prat! How is me saying that for me it was at least a minute out of sync trolling? Thanks to everyone that suggested I use VLC to watch I had been using xbmc as I can control it with a remote whilst watching instead of having to connect to my server via remote desktop and having to have my laptop on my lap whilst I watch. Unfortunately I cannot find a way to re-sync the audio on xbmc so if anyone out there knows how I can please let me know. Yes I knew that it wasn't going to be as good quality as other uploads but that didnt bother me if that was the only way to watch it but the audio, for me anyway, was too annoying to watch (my reasons for which are explained above).

Kcbay I agree the uploader is too hard on himself especially as for a long time his was the only copy of this available and as such it was hugely appreciated by those of us who cannot watch weekly on tv. Using vlc made the episode watchable and thats all we ask (or all we should ask) of the people that take the trouble to upload stuff for us."
