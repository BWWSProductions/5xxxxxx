,jus01,2010-11-19T02:00Z,"Thank you TV team, I've downloaded all the Downton abbeys but just wanted to make a comment about E6.

After about 5--6min in the sound/video goes out of sinc all the others are fine and very good quality but its just this one I found a problem with, I tried re-downloading it but same problem i'm not sure if anyone else has had this?"
,ojman873,2010-12-03T06:53Z,"@jus01 (and others), I also had video and audio go off sync after a few minutes.  I would recommend the following:
• Downloading VLC Media Player if you don't already have it (available free from their website)
• After opening the .avi with VLC, go into preferences and see what keys code for decrease/increase audio delay.
• Delay the audio by -200ms; this brings the audio and video back in sync."
,btbuz,2011-01-22T05:02Z,This version like the other torrent of approximately 350mb will not play as downloaded.  There are errors in the AVI file which probably came from the same source.  I'm downloading the larger file now to see if that can be played as received.  I did eventually get to see the entire episode 6.  My thanks to you folks who perform a wonderful service.
,tesskrit,2011-10-11T07:37Z,the sound/video out of sinc is for 3 minutes only
