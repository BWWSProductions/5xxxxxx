,wayneking,2010-11-18T03:27Z,"Thanks for the UL.  Good quality.  Great work.  Much appreciated.

In my opinion, this is A:9 (could be louder) and V:8 (as slightly dark at times, although very sharp image.

Gotta say though, as far as this film goes, I think it's the most overrated movie of the past couple of years.  Poor acting for the most part and while a very original idea and superb cinematography, a pretty dull plot and bunch of characters.  All in all, poorly written.  Very disappointing considering the potential of the concept imo.

Thanks again to the ULer of course. "

,jamiejade1971,2010-12-31T01:22Z,I recieved a notice from my internet provider. Warner Bros. contacted them to say that I Illegally downloaded Inception. This was the file they CLAIM I downloaded. Just thought I'd let you all know as a warning.

sorry im new to this :("
,keallineage,2011-01-23T20:55Z,Terrible quality. I was hoping a DVDR would be better. My personal encoding of a 700mb download is better than this crap.
,djmopa,2011-03-05T17:40Z,"Great copy, anyone who says it is not, is full of SHIT.... 2Lions always rips the best quality.

,Nerdje,2011-04-20T16:31Z,Excuse me for my question because I know it's a noobie thing to ask. But how do I make that VIDEO_TS map into 1 file so that I can watch it on WMP? If someone would explain me how to do that I could download and seed much more movies because I now only download movies wich are allready.. i don't know.. converted into one file? Allready thanks for the load :)
,M-Rhythm1,2011-05-16T13:40Z,"Thanks 2Lions-Team
Begin gewend te raken aan de kwaliteit van Lions-team ;)"
,Anonym099,2011-05-25T07:05Z,"Okay, call me an idiot, or whatever you like, but what's DVDR? I know it's a DVD Recorder, but does it actually record everything on the DVD (not just the movie itself but the menus, audio, subtitles, special features, etc...)? So if I opened these files up, I would get the movie as if I had bought it?"
,Anonym099,2011-05-25T07:08Z,Great movie by the way.
,Anonym099,2011-05-30T02:12Z,Is there a way to add this to iTunes?
,Beatrobox,2011-08-02T14:24Z,"Super, echt gave film!! Bedankt"
,CeAxayacatl,2011-09-06T01:45Z,Thanks for the spanish subtitles bro! :)
,howiepea,2011-11-02T07:44Z,"Hi... Got a question: First off, Im guessing the reason there are DVDRs torrents is for people who wish to burn them directly onto dvd to watch in their home players.  If this is so the case, then my question is regarding how to put these files onto disc. I would like to believe it is a simple burning the files as is..?  Anyhow can someone please give me some advice on this topic..."
