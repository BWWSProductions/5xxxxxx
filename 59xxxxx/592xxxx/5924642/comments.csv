[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-21T05:26Z,looks good.  whats the exact procedure to make 360 play the DD stream vs  default AAC stream?

As far as I no, DD 5.1 is supported on 360 however, It is not supported when using a streaming software. I have researched it and couldn't come up with anything"
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-22T00:41Z,i believe it only works with avi container.

[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-23T04:29Z,suppose if i was an xbox 360 person i would just make 1080p AC3 avi files for my xbox.  never did figure out good settings though for xvid using ffmpeg.
