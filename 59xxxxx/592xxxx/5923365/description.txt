Professor John Halder (Viggo Mortensen) has a lot on his plate -- a neurotic wife, two small children and a mother suffering from dementia -- in this drama set in World War II Germany. But his life changes after he writes a book promoting compassionate euthanasia. When the Nazi party embraces his ideas, Halder faces a series of subtle ethical choices that gradually compromise his morality and his relationships.
