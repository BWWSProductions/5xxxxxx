         An unknown axe murderer still stalks a family he brutally     
         murdered a century ago and then next-door a spirit with       
         a deadly secret haunts a young couple. An off the beaten      
         path bar is stocked with other worldly spirits. A railroad    
         brakeman killed in a train accident haunts the tunnel where   
         his body was mangled. A grandmother who passed on lets her    
         family know she's watching over them...and finally a Civil    
          War bridge reveals an apparition of a Confederate soldier.
