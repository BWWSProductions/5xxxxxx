On the beautiful, remote Scottish coast, two lovers are drawn together by a dark legacy and a wild and dangerous desire...Rumours of a truthsayer have brought Katla Svensdottir to Orkney, searching for a way to clear her brother's name. What she finds is far from what she expected. Gavin is a recluse, driven close to madness by the voices that crowd his mind. Katla strikes a bold bargain - offering to share Gavin's bed in exchange for his help. But as she watches this proud, magnificent man struggle to keep his humanity, she knows that more than her brother's fate is at stake.

Gavin's mysterious abilities have grown more powerful over time, as have their terrible consequences. Katla is the only person whose thoughts are hidden from him, though he longs to know if she shares his passion. At last he has found a woman who can calm the demons within him - yet the truth he has sworn to reveal may tear her from him forever...................
