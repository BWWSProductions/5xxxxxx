This is my second scanned guide. Learned my lesson with the first, so the image size is considerably bigger. There are however a FEW, but not as many, blurry spots. Due to the font and size and because the book is so large. I refuse to rip the pages off the bind. Steer clear of the walk through and use the maps towards the back and you should play a spoiler-free game. Once again, hope you ungrateful bastards enjoy!
