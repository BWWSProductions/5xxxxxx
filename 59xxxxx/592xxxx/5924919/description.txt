iNK NOTES
Blurred the black box at top. Blurred out all the property of tags. Had to split the movie into over 60 parts to blur them all. Did a re-encode using a new white color correction filter a buddy made for me. Audio is my usual remastered 5.1 AC3. A lot of was put in but it's just fun for me just to see how good it can be done...

credit iNK & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
