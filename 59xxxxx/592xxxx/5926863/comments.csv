,dhiz,2010-11-18T15:24Z,"Don't download this file.

Inside this file it extract a file known as ""hotfix.exe"" for those unfamiliar with this file its a rogue anti-virus program (trojan)

I fell victim of it too, on Windows 7 it will open up to a splash screen and tell you all this information; you may have to start your computer up in safemode and open up task manager and close the file ""hotfix.exe"". Luckily for me I was able to find the file under Appdata > Roaming and delete it for good.

I've heard accounts if your unable to do that, you can go to settings on the splashscreen of this monster and click launch unprotected; hit the ""X"" and you can boot to your desktop. If you got AVG it will detect this file in a few minutes of uptime.

So once again; don't download this trojan!
