-----------------------------------------------------------

1.0 	December 20 2010 	

    * Working server-side inventory. And as a result of that, a whole pile of bugs and issues got fixed.
    * Made SMP servers save chunks way less often in most cases. Chunks donÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t resave if they got saved in the last 30 seconds.
    * Moving too far away from a container, or having it blow up, closes the inventory screen.
    * Fixed /kill.
    * Introduced leaf decay again. It acts differently from before, as it now drops the saplings from the leaves.
    * You can now throw eggs.
    * Throwing an egg has a chance of spawning a chicken.
    * Added super exclusive clan cloaks for Mojang Employees.
    * When you mouse over a block, a tooltip appears (its name pops up in a box).
    * You can't store things in the inventory crafting blocks anymore.
    * .. and something else, which is even more rare 

New Bugs:

    * When looking in a double chest you can't do anything with the two bottom rows in your inventory. This only happens on existing Alpha-created worlds.
    * Players get disconnected after a short while on local Minecraft servers (.jar) (?)
    * Game starting problem for some people (especially Mac)
    * Item duplication bug
