,thecaptainofsweden,2010-11-06T10:09Z,"The Bourne Identity: You may change menus to some other languages (only those that is also is possible to use as subs.) than English.

The Bourne Supremacy: Same as in The Bourne Identity. 

The Bourne Ultimatum: Same as in The Bourne Identity. (there is a few more languages to choose from)

All movies include English subtitles and menus if that is your choice.

In Agentbays commet there are lists of the spoken languages.

I hope my help and the RiPs is to your and everybody elses satisfaction. :)
