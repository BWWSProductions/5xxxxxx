If you do have or expect to soon have, an HD capable DivX disc player
I suggest you might want to download our HD version of this movie set instead.
We have many seeders on it right now, with a great many completions already
accomplished too.

If you instead only have a standard DivX capable dvd player, then you can come
pretty close to the real thing (I dare you to tell the difference in the majority
of such cases - the quality is incredible - as it is all converted from bluray 
720p source files, to a nicer file size for you). 

These versions (including our HD version) give you the closest thing to being
in a movie theater I can tell you. Since they aren't showing these movies at the
theaters much anymore, enjoy!

We have long since paid for these movies, and not every family that deserves to see this piece of culture should have to fork over a hundred bucks for bluray (or whatever the price of the discs are now) or have to buy an expensive player to boot.

We see it as a tax of sorts, we also think we have collectively paid off these movies for everyone to enjoy this version we bring to you.

For those who have the dough to fork over, go ahead and make the studios richer-
however they  aint doin anything worthwhile with our dough as I write this comment.

Please share - and we do have speed at this time - if we all pull together. 
Grazie
