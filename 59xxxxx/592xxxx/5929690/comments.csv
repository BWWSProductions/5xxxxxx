When you sign up its about ĂÂŁ30 a month. You try to unreg and you cant. You make no money. If you dont sign up they constantly ring you till you threaten to shove somthing very large in a dark place and even then they get a woman to ring you back. If you have any doubts google it and read the real reviews. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it usualy IS. I forgot my own rule. BIG MISTAKE. I had to cancel my entire bank account."
