Twenty-First Century Warplanes and Helicopters features the most important military fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft currently in service around the world. These include the warplanes currently in US service, such as the B-1 and B-2 bombers, the F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-15 Eagle and F-14 Tomcat. Also featured are the warplanes and helicopters that area a crucial part of NATO's air defence network, such as the Tornado, Harrier, Eurofighter Typhoon and PAH-2 Tiger. In addition, the book contains the most important airborne warning and air control system (AWACS) aircraft in service, such as the Sentry, E-767 and Mainstay.
Though multirole combat aircraft form the cutting edge of modern air forces, transporters provide essential logistical support for both ground and air units. Twenty-First Century Warplanes and Helicopters therefore features transport aircraft and helicopters currently in service around the world, including the C-141 Starlifter, II-76 Candid, C-130 Hercules, C-17 Globemaster, CH-47 Chinook and CH-53 Sea Stallion. Each aircraft featured is illustrated by a full-color photograph and accompanied by text that describes its design, development and deployment history.
