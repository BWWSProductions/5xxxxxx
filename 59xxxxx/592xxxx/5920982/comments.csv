Did you see my request for Episode 12?  Hope you have it ;-)"
,asighkick,2010-10-31T07:07Z,"p.s. I have just watched the first few minutes of both E02 and E03 and think you must be having a few problems with capturing and encoding these episodes?

Comparing E01 (from another source) with E02 by Phil @ EOF is like chalk and cheese.  E02 has sound sync and echo problems along with grainy picture.  It is watchable but surprisingly poor quality considering it has a larger file size and higher bitrate video than Episode 01.

E01 is 204,792 KB, 624 x 352, 1045 kbps, XviD ISO MPEG-4 and 128kb/s 48kHz Stereo sound.

E02 is 223,894 KB, 700 x 398, 1201 kbps, XviD ISO MPEG-4 and 121 kb/s 44,100kHz.

Perhaps reduce the screen size and video frequency and figure out what is putting your sound out of sync?

Do hope that you can sort out your problems for future uploads.  I don't cap myself as it is a fairly skilled and time consuming job.

Good luck."

Unfortunately, the foremost is that these uploads are from VCR tape which has been recorded in letterbox which is then cropped and converted to AVI via some free software on an old laptop. Essentially, the source is poor and my equipment is old. I haven't had a chance to play with options but perhaps lowering the resolution (since 700x400 is actually higher than a TV screen) and altering the bitrate would at least make the file size smaller and eliminate the sync problems (which seem to be processor power related). I welcome concrete suggestions."
,Phil_Sapphire,2010-10-31T19:12Z,e12 is now up as requested!
