Empire-WoW is a x3 blizzard like, based server that is currently running WOTLK 3.3.5a. enUS patch. We have been running for just over 2 years and have over 1700 active accounts with over 200-300 on 

and off. We have a busy staff team who are always putting on events, asking for suggestions and handling bugs when needed.

We run a none donative based realm - this means there isn't anyone overpowered and provides our server with a 100% fair game play.

There is a great community inside our server, with various chatty members discussing various topics on our realm forums and in our world chat. There is something for everyone and any age! We provide 

a mature and controlled environment with Game Masters looking and making sure nothing gets out of hand. 

We have various teams of people working in different area's from events, bug fixing, administration and handling tickets! Our team is based on our Ventrilo server, our info can be found below!
