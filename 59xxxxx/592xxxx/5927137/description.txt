I sourced this from Rally.To.Restore.Sanity.And.Or.Fear.2010.HDTV.XviD-sHoTV

I converted it into DVD-NTSC format for everybody and added chapters every 10 minutes for easy seeking.

This copy came out VERY good. The sound gives out for a second (literally just a second) a few times but that's because of the source I used (the source video file has the sound giving out a few times).

Enjoy! I figured most people would rather watch this on their tv than their computer.

Again, this is NOT a retail DVD. I have no idea if they are even going to release the rally on DVD. This was sourced from an hdtv rip that I converted into DVD-R NTSC format for everybody.
