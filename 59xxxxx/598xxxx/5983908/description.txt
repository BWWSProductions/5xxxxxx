An intriguing tale of espionage and treasonâ€¦this is a work to enthrall.â€ â€” Daily Mail

Michael Dobbsâ€™ thrilling novel about the dawn of World War II, and Winston Churchillâ€™s rise to power.

It is the dawn of World War II, and Neville Chamberlain believes he has bought â€œpeace for our timeâ€ from Adolph Hitler, who has just seized Czechoslovakiaâ€™s Sudetenland. The English are alarmed by the huge German army, while the soldiers that would defend London donâ€™t even have steel helmets. For many, compromise and appeasement seem to be Englandâ€™s best defense.

But there are a few leaders who donâ€™t agree. Among them is Winston Churchill, who understands that the relentless march of fascism will be democracyâ€™s death knell. In October 1938, Churchill pleads his case in the press to the BBCâ€™s Guy Burgess. One of these two will become the most revered man of his time, and the other will be known as the greatest of traitors.

This stunning novel brings to life the surprising political intrigues that set the stage for World War II, and brings alive the passionate, grumpy, whiskey-drinking Winston Churchill, as he inspires his fellow countrymen to take on the worldâ€™s mightiest army.
