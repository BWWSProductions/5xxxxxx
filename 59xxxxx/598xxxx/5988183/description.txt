Personally I think this is a very underrated band of the 80's.

Les Enfants were formed in 1982 by Ronan O'Hanlon and John McEnlly. Derek Herbert joined in September 1982. Flo McSweeney joined in December 1983 but did not stay long with the band and turned down an offer to join full time in April 1984 when the band signed a potential six album deal with Chrysalis Records. She later joined Moving Hearts. Les Enfants had a minor hit with 'Slipaway' in 1985.
