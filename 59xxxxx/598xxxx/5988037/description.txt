Minecraft 1.2.3_04

This includes the update and the full version. You really don't need anything but the update if you have any version of minecraft newer than a month.

The files from the update go in the bin folder in .minecraft.

If you don't have minecraft already download the full version. It goes in "username\appdata\roaming\.minecraft" on vista and 7, or "username\application data\.minecraft" on xp.

If you have trouble creating a folder with a "." at the beginning, use 7-zip or winrar and extract minecraft to ".minecraft".
