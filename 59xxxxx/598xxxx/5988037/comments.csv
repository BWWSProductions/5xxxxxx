,gnahd_cute,2010-11-29T10:01Z,"just wanted to ask what is the system requirements of this game? ive watch this game on youtube and this game is so cool, reply is appreciated TY"
,smurfmurfet,2010-11-29T12:02Z,"The system requirements for this game are to have a working computer. This game can run in an internet browser. If you're not sure goto www.minecraft.net and play classic single player. If you can run that fine, then you're set. 

Id you're having trouble finding the appdata folder, just goto Run (Windows-R) and type ""%AppData%. Copy the .minecraft folder in there and run minecraft.jar. You can't play online with this version, but offline is good enough."
