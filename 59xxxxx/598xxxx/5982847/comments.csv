,stockholm,2011-03-11T22:37Z,sad to say there is no sound to the picture. i tried three different players including vlc. :-(

@stockholm

Read the description:

Audio Tracks ( all demuxed, skip from download the ones you don't want )
Use MPC http://cccp-project.net/ to be able to automatically recognize & play
the external Audio tracks
or mux the Audio in MKV with  mkvmerge 
http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKVtoolnix if you wish to use other player.

""Media Player Classic"" will play the audio, without you havin' to do anything."
,stockholm,2011-03-15T20:14Z,"i did read and i have downloaded cccp. still no sound from any player i have tried...
so don't blame the failure of this download on my reading abilities. :-)"
,linzeb,2011-03-16T03:10Z,"Did you dl. the entire torrent? Or just the .mkv file? Did you try opening it with ""Media Player Classic"" included in CCCP?"
,john rallus,2012-01-09T19:02Z,thank you for all the subs! great work!
,Chuddee,2012-02-20T19:11Z,"How can i remove the subtitles with Media Player Classic? They're inside the .mkv itself. Not as a separate file. I can disable them in VLC player but that wont play the audio. 

This is poorly done, there should be no subs in the .mkv file."
