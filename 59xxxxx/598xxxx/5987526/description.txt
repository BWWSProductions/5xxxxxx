Bringing to mind a superb mix of Dexter Gordon and Sonny Rollins, I'm All for
You finds forward-thinking saxophonist Joe Lovano expertly balancing heartfelt
melodicism and cerebral harmonic improvisation. Easily one of Lovano's most
listenable endeavors, the ballads-oriented album pulls no punches and simply
allows you to sit back and enjoy a master play at his utter best. Joining him is
journeyman pianist Hank Jones, who brings his urbane touch to such classic
standards as "Don't Blame Me" and "Like Someone in Love." Rounding out the
ensemble are longtime Lovano associates bassist George Mraz and drummer Paul
Motian, who lend an egoless mentality to the proceedings, helping to emphasize
lush group interplay over individual pyrotechnics.
