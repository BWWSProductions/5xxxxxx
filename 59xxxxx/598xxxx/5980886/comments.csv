,.Leto.,2011-01-16T10:46Z,As usual with SecretMyth extremely dark picture. Fix your computer screen or fix your eyes but I'm tired of your shitty dark rips.
,daveo76,2011-01-25T07:52Z,what gives. When it started to download it went to my full speed at 1mbps for first few minutes now it gone down to nearly dial-up speed. Why that :(
