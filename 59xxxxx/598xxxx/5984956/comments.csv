,tizzay89,2010-12-13T10:43Z,why would it be named axxo lol i dont think they even upload here anymore.. and the only trusted source of that work name is by the user (circleness)    lol just been using this site for about 3 years so i could be wrong
,bonzai37,2010-12-14T05:02Z,"Thanks!!!

tizzay89 You're WRONG You don't understand how file sharing and torrents actually work."
,bonzai37,2010-12-14T05:04Z,The ignorance here abounds!!!
,bert2006,2010-12-22T22:22Z,"looking at the screen shots they couldnt be from the vid. the quality is too high for a 640x272 avi.

will confirm after dl"
,Tatletz,2011-01-06T06:44Z,Audio and video dont match! Quality is good but speech is delayed so it's a bit annoying.
,Tatletz,2011-01-08T04:22Z,"I am so sorry sceneline, the above comment is for another movie from a different uploader. Posted it here by mistake - lol."
,chris1379,2011-02-06T02:58Z,Choppy playback on Phillips DVP3140. Slightly visible on the PC but I can't quite figure why it's like that. All your other rips are great quality so keep up the good work.
,KeeSusie,2011-02-26T01:46Z,"Thanks for sharing, sceneline!  There were a few hiccups in the video where it would freeze, and I'd have to FF or RW for a minute or two and then it would be fine.  At first I thought the problem was related to my laptop but since I haven't experienced the same thing with other videos, I'm thinking the issue is specific to this video file."
,TenRapesASecond,2011-02-28T17:01Z,"choppy playback , this is the worst release i have ever downloaded, you should be banned for this movie"
