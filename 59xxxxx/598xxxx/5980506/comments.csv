,82211986,2010-11-27T19:14Z,"Hey can someone help me out here...I updated to the new dashboard after AC:B asked me to update my firmware after the update the game told me that there was a disc error and could not be played...

Now what i understand is that AP 2.5 has been put in the game and you need to patch the ISO and burn a fresh disc...I just wanted to know whether this particular ISO has already been patched or will i have to patch is all over again so that it runs under the new update..."
,wingman72,2010-11-27T22:58Z,"I burned it and it says it's the wrong region code, I'm in region 1, can anybody help me out?"
,remedy2,2010-11-28T04:17Z,@samoned55- you need to flash your drive to the new firmware.  I myself am going to let the new firmware get used for a while before I flash my drive with it.  I'm sure c4e did a fine job testing it but its new and you never know if they thought of everything when they tested it.  Going to wait to see if any issues arise.
,moonyi,2010-11-28T10:05Z,Will this burn normally and work?
,hunter212yy,2010-11-28T10:42Z,"Do not download this version if you have LT+, there is no verified patch for ABGX360, I burnt the disc 2 ways and it doesn't work, I get the ""black screen"". Just download the normal version and gtfo to school to learn some English."
,d3fik,2010-11-28T14:48Z,"If you have Hitachi drive 1.51 Ixtreme it work on 100% First check on ABGX360 1.04 and burn :)

,hitman585,2011-01-11T20:21Z,@Fighter7777 any reason why they are making it way too far? i hope they are improving things in the pc version 
,Batmanfan202,2011-02-21T04:44Z,"I bought this game for 360 cause I felt impatient to wait for PC version so I could download it.
All Ubisoft is doing improving the DRM which is useless..."
