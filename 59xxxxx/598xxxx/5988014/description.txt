Chris Rea Blue Guitars Album 3(Louisiana & New Orleans)(mp3 320 kbs)ICM369
__________________________________________________________________________

Blue Guitars is a Blues album released by Chris Rea on October 14th 2005 
consisting of eleven CDs, one DVD and a full colour book, including paintings 
by the artist, liner notes and song lyrics. 

The album is an ambitious project with the 137 songs recorded over the course 
of 1 1/2 years with a work schedule - according to Chris Rea himself - of 
twelve hours a day, seven days a week.

The collection is the fifth and last release in a line of Blues recordings 
Chris Rea has made since recovering from a serious disease at the turn of the 
millennium and promising himself a return to his Bluesy roots in the event that 
he survived. 

According to Rea "Blue Guitars" will be his last solo effort; however, he will 
continue to release albums as a member of the band "Memphis Fireflies".

Albums

The eleven separate records which comprise "Blue Guitars" could as well stand on 
their own; in combination, however, they provide a journey through the different 
epochs of the Blues, showing the various components that have been added to the 
original African Blues over time, the changes in instrumentation, style, lyrical 
expression and thematic implications. 

Thereby Chris Rea and his band imitate the various styles and lyrical topics, 
creating an instantly recognisable atmosphere on each record, with the first few 
songs usually setting up the direction in which the record is going and then 
developing to various styles within the field of each record.

Album Number Three - Louisiana & New Orleans
____________________________________________

The Blues presented on this record may be "The Blues" to many. When the originally 
African and South influenced Blues were brought to Louisiana, New Orleans, the 
Mississippi Delta, new instruments were added - clarinet, brass, piano, mandolins, 
accordions - and along with the banjo mingled into an interesting mix, which would 
be known as New Orleans, Swamp, Cajun or Riverboat Blues. 

The basics for directions like Jazz, Swing and even Rock & Roll were lain during 
this time and a distinctive, instantly recognizable sound was created, which would 
imminently be associated with the Blues.
