In the middle of a suburban neighborhood sits a black house with a dead lawn. The neighbors do not know that hidden deep beneath this home is the vast secret hideout of the supervillain Gru (Steve Carell) and his army of Minions which are tiny yellow pill-shaped creatures in overalls and goggles, who speak in an indistinctive language. When he learns of the Pyramid theft, his pride is badly wounded and he resolves to pull the biggest heist in world history by stealing the Moon. Gru tries to get a loan from the local Bank of Evil, where he meets a young supervillain named Vector (Jason Segel). While Gru is reading through the blueprints for his Moon heist rocket, Vector annoys him by talking about his name and showing him his newest weapon, a gun that shoots piranhas. Mr. Perkins (Will Arnett), the bank president, refuses to give Gru a loan until he obtains the shrink ray necessary for the plan. He tells Gru that he is getting too old and the new supervillains are younger with more money producing schemes, like Vector who is revealed to be the one who stole the Pyramid of Giza. As Gru leaves the bank, he shoots Vector in the head with his freeze ray while he is trying to reload his piranha gun.
