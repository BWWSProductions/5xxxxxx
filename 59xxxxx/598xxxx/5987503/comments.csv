thats very welcoming :)
plz do step up 3D in 480p format...plz when its out on bluray.""

In ENCODING - it would be 1 GB 480p (it must be so big 'cause of the content - lot of crowded scenes, group dancing, et.c). 

@DMVIN: Have 6 BluRays to rip... so, do the math... LOL"
,htctouch,2010-11-26T20:14Z,thnx allot for these awsm movies . love u mahn
,madtown4,2010-11-26T21:13Z,thank you...my grandson loves the movie dispicable me...thanks again
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-26T21:38Z,"Thanks.

@aftaab4u: I upload my encodings only. You can, however request a format - for this movie as 272p (handheld compatible, 320p or 352p or - desired size within these formats - and I would look into."
,punk67,2010-11-26T21:53Z,Thanks twenty forty !cant help noticing no tv pack so far is there a problem with tpb?will you be upping it soon?dont mean to hassle you mate just curious!thanks as always mate!!
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-26T22:35Z,"@punk67: Well, empty pack doesn't make any good. Kidding aside, yesterday weren't aired shows from my schedule. Tonight only Sanctuary US would be aired (and I usually up my encode day after, even if Sanctuary never was part of)... and I deserve some break too."
,azrielle,2010-11-27T07:57Z,Thank you for Despicable Me and Scott Pilgrim.  Have you done The Expendables?  That is not necessarily a request.  Just curious.
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-27T09:01Z,"@azrielle: Yep, three times - as R5, dDVDrip then BluRay. But it was long ago, and I doubt that any of my torrents have seeders so long.

Do Search (up on the page)

Expendables+H264

and see what can be found."
