VRayScatter lets V-Ray generate huge amounts of objects in an array. Never before within 3ds Max could a user create scenes with millions of objects. With VRayScatter, the user is able to create huge forest areas or even a city with uncountable amount of buildings in two clicks. Quick render time generation of objects with optimized RAM management makes the process of scene creation as easy as 123.

Integrated special procedural map VRayScatterTexture allows a user to define random color for every object in the array for a pure realistic effect. VRayScatterTexture can also be used on any object in the scene.
