OpenStreetMap creates and provides free geographic data such as street maps to anyone who wants them. The project was started because most maps you think of as free actually have legal or technical restrictions on their use, holding back people from using them in creative, productive, or unexpected ways. 

Planet.osm is a snapshot of the OpenStreetMap database.

What's included?

Planet.osm is the latest revision of the nodes, ways, relations and changesets in the database. This of course includes all the tags. It does not include the editing history. It does not include GPS traces behind the data.

The file is an XML formatted .osm file.
