,godofwrath08,2010-11-25T00:52Z,loads of crapp the file could be real but i guarantee if axxo wanted you to share there files they'd use ther own account to tell us like here for instance is were all AXXO'S torrents r     http://thepiratebay.org/user/aXXo-torrents/0/3
,godofwrath08,2010-11-25T00:59Z,dnt belive him the site he says he got them from dunt exist past registraion u register and then boom page dunt exist error.
,1200Mics,2010-11-30T21:50Z,"Please stop using the aXXo name.
aXXo is not active. 
His last torrent was made in March 2009.
Have some respect for the man, make your own name with a quality product."
,Dogstar22,2010-12-06T19:23Z,"hey Sceneline why bother using axxo on your downloads, not considered the done thing, shame you have to do that really on such great files, i downloaded 2-3 and not 1 bad copy in em all, A=10 V=10, so do yourself a favour stop using the axxo name, you really dont need to"
,squigglesklok,2011-02-02T02:21Z,"I was just reading the comments and it made me question the fact that you can actually understand what you are reading or typing! axxo may not be active but this is an axxo rip being uploaded here by some one else that have the respect to actually keep axxo in the file name rather than sceneline lie and put his name on this if it isn't his rip! If axxo isnt active then appreciate the fact that some one is still trying to make his files available! I hate piraters that bitch at each other or complain, so annoying!"
,Hackers_inc,2011-02-05T02:37Z,Come on guys... you sure weren't complaining when you downloaded it so stop the rucus and get yo pirate on! sceneline you rock!
,Scorpwanna,2011-08-17T04:30Z,A tip for those who rip dvds. If 6channel try to increase the vocal channel to normalize or if available use the 2 channel stereo audio track.
