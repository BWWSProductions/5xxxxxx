Old and new Detroit collide in a case investigated by Fitch, Washington and Sanchez where a missing teen, Seth Cantor, seems to have been violently murdered - but there isn't a body. The detectives begin to unravel the disturbing homicide, which leads them to Seth's high school buddies, who are running drugs in from Canada and may have killed their friend by copying the MO of the Purple Gang, an old Detroit mob. Meanwhile, Longford and Majahan explore the world of high stakes poker when a victim, who was trying to amass winnings to pay for his daughter's organ transplant, is found murdered and stripped of his prize money from a tournament.
