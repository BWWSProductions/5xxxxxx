John Lee Hooker The Healer 1989(mp3 320kbs)ICM369
_________________________________________________

The Healer was oddly a major mainstream breakthrough for John Lee Hooker. 

The album was one of the first to feature a wide array of guest stars, 
including Bonnie Raitt, Los Lobos and Carlos Santana. 

The album immediately captured widespread media attention because of all 
the superstar musicians involved in its production and has to date been 
John Lee\'s most successful release. 

Recorded in analog and mixed to 1/4\" 15ips analog tape, the sound is better 
than almost any other Hooker recording. 

Transferred from the original 1/4\" analog tapes by Bernie Grundman using 
Classic\'s \"all tube\" cutting system, gives this release a warmth and comfort 
it has never had. 

If you\'re a John Lee Hooker fan then this a must! Great sound and classic 
Hooker guitar and vocal performances.
