Zofia Kilanowicz sings with Antoni Wit conducting the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra.

Henryk Gorecki, one of the leading composers of the Polish avant-garde, harshly and unfairly criticised for diverting to a tonal, romantic style of composition, recently passed away after battling illness for decades. His work Symphony No. 3, Op. 36 'Symphony of Sorrowful Songs' (1976), is his best known work, and one of the most moving works ever written. Please listen to this and share in his legacy. No doubt this will be filling out concert halls all over the world within the next few years, so please support the Gorecki family and legacy and attend, you will be glad you did.

Also included on this CD rip is '3 Olden Style Pieces' (1963), which is a beautiful ode to Polish folk music.
