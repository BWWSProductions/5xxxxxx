I love this guy. He's a real inspiration to a few Canadians in the cold north!

Tea Party On!

,silveroakleaf,2010-11-27T02:39Z,Zorch...thanks for your uploads - from everyone who can't see Glenn otherwise.
,NWS2000,2010-11-27T03:35Z,"ZorchTorrent... thank you VERY much, from both my wife and I. We're on hard times and Beck has been the one show we miss more than anything. Without you we'd not be able to keep up with the ""news"" the other stations miss. You know, all that good old ""Praise Obama"" journalism on the other networks. Thank you Zorch... it REALLY does mean a lot to these two people!!! And have a MERRY CHRISTMAS and a safe, happy New Year!.  :-)"

@ Herkimer: unfortunately, I don't have and Insider Extreme subscription, or a web radio setup,  so I don't have access to the full radio show content. However, search around, i have seen someone uploading both the audio and video content from the radio show. "

@Herk - I don't know who your Cable provider is, but all Canadian cable providers will offer you Fox News - for a price - the CRTC has placed it higher up the frequency in the Channel 180 or better, and if you subscribe to Fox you have to pay for a 'news package'.

Contact your cable provider: Shaw, Rogers, Cogeco, Videotron, etc do carry Fox. :)"
