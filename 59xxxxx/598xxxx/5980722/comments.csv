If more people ask then i will upload new releases from 300mbunited

Note : I usually like to encode old movies myself "
[T],MitZep,2010-11-24T20:15Z,"encoding is cool but uploading movies from 300mbunited will reduce your workload...
thats all if someone requests a movie and it is on 300mbunited then it is easier for yu to just upload it.... "
,swatkat,2010-11-25T04:36Z,dude...it will be cool if u can provide the cd covers also with ur releases........
,smasudi,2010-11-25T04:43Z,"i agree , u should upload releases from 300mb united...they r already encoded so it will save ur time.."

,swatkat,2010-11-25T10:45Z,yes gunnersrock u can supplement ur SUPERB encodes with that of Scorps..........
,swatkat,2010-11-25T10:46Z,Can u give any details of the sofwares u use to encode the rips??????? If u can give the settings as well it is most welcome.........
[T],gunnersrock,2010-11-25T13:47Z,"@swatkat
I mainly use staxrip,handbrake and mediacoder.

download a program called mediainfo and open any movie encoded by me in it and it will show you the settings i've used.

if you want to experiment, download a 20min tv show like ""two and a half men"" in 720p and encode it with different settings until you're satisfied with the quality {encoding won't take too long because the show is just 20 minutes long}

hope that answered your question..............."
,DSIN,2010-11-25T14:29Z,"@gunnersrock : I agree... ur rips r very similar to scorp ... in size & quality... so if u want u shld post more 300mbunited rips as most ppl prefer torrent dloads to server dloads IMO
i also use handbrake to reduce size of some of my anime & music videos as it is more user friendly ... 
btw y do most of uploaders use megui instead of handbrake ? "
