I only have about 700Gb drive-space left on the 3Tb I have installed but the PC can handle 2 more SATA drives/16-USB ports v1.1, 2 & 3 (almost lost 500Gb of documentaries on an external WD-HDD - Internalized/fixed and exchanged w/ 640Gb SATA - In the end I lost 1 torrent file, no media loss at all)

You're welcome!
Just help me seed!!!"
