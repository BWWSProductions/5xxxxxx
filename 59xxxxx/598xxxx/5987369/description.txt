You mind subtitles? I hate subtitles but NGC.NL broadcasts w/ hardcoded subs so either do not download this one or find another posting of this program (if available).
The audio is the original 5.1 Dolby Digital stream captured in a 6.9Gb AVC[1080i]/DD 5.1/MP2 TS file on my HD-STB HDD recorder: Humax iHDR-5050c cable decoder/ftp server.

Video recoded from AVC 1080i to x264 [CRF 21.5 <better than high Q>] 720p
Audio direct copy 5.1 DD > 5.1 DD

A/V Synch = 100% accurate.
Commercials cut quality = 100% no loss/no excesses.
The only thing telling that it is NGC is the yellow rectangle logo [top-left] with HD below it & of course the annoying subtitles.

Xtreme quality audio/video.

Enjoy & pls. help seed to help true knowledge propagate.
Thanx
