This torrent contains two Snail cds â€“ the first album and the second â€˜Unshelledâ€™ one.

The Snail CD
I recorded this on an everyday PC and I think it turned out ok. If you like Beach Boys, Bacharach, Rundgren, Prefab Sprout, Jimmy Webb, Gary Clark and people of that ilk, you may well go for this. 

Track listing: 
01. Almost Feels Like Summer 
02. Wavelength 
03. Beautiful And Funny 
04. French Princess 
05. Haunted 
06. Light In The Dark 
07. Fill Your Emptiness 
08. Sure 
09. Savannah 
10. Roses 
11. Found 

Composed, arranged, played, sung, engineered and produced by me. 

Love songs with lots of harmonies for you to wallow in. Hope you like it. 

PLEASE RESEED!!!

This is an acoustic mp3cd â€“ one guitar and one vocal. All songs are original except those marked with *.

I am influenced by the likes of Brian Wilson, Prefab Sprout, Jimmy Webb, Steely Dan, Neil Young, Burt Bacharach, Gary Clark etc. etc.

I give my music away because I want to!

Best wishes and please reseed!
