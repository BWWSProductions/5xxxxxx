Just what will motoring be like in a post apocalyptic world thatâ€™s been blown to bits by nuclear bombs or a massive comet? Itâ€™s a burning question thatâ€™s on literally nobodyâ€™s mind, and we give you all the answers in this brand new, incredibly cheerful Top Gear DVD.

Embarking on a terrifying journey into the future, we show you how to drive to work in the perpetual darkness of a Nuclear Winter, how to make motorsport exciting when thereâ€™s only two racing drivers left alive, and, in a world where all cars are bristling with weapons, how to survive the savage, explosive fury of a Doomsday M.O.T test.

And amongst all the nuclear carnage, we also tackle the ultimate petrolheadâ€™s dilemma â€“ what cars would you take for a final drive if there was only one barrel of petrol left on the planet? The explosions are huge, the cars are superb, so relax and enjoy.

PS. This frightening vision of a post nuclear world is backed up by top scientists, in case you think itâ€™s us just cocking about.

Brand New for 2010 Never seen on TV!

ENJOY!
