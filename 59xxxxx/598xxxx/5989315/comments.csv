,mammon78,2010-11-27T10:33Z,Thank You! Top Gear UK is the only one to watch.  The others are just clones that suffered from a bit of inbreeding.
,Mondoman22,2010-11-27T16:34Z,"Excellent,
 Thank you love these guys they are hilarious!!!

Mamon78,
   Absolutely correct in your analogy.. There
are some shows you just do not duplicate and
especially with some punk ass Tanner Foust
and a halfbreed from Nascar. Not very original
at all... I was pretty disgusted when i saw the
U.S. Version of top gear.. I am in the states and
after i cleaned the puke off my tv i realized there will never be another top gear only the
original....

      Cheers"
