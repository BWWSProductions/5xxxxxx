,Junpoppa,2010-11-24T15:06Z,You're welcome :D
,Junpoppa,2010-11-24T15:37Z,"Oh, and one more thing! for those of you who wish to play online, don't click on anything when you open the game. Just wait and the ""Steam Group Severs"" will automatically pop out on your screen!"
,Gorganide,2010-11-25T09:28Z,"WOW! I've been looking all over for this :)))))))) 
Thank you it works fine!
but are there other ways to play online and not only steam servers ?
thank you once again!"
,Junpoppa,2010-11-25T15:20Z,"Sure, you can play it on Garena and or Hamachi"
,Armenian,2010-11-25T15:48Z,"the procedure entry point SteamAPI_GetSteamInstallPath could not be found located in the dynamic link library steam_api.dll.

can someone help me please?"
,Junpoppa,2010-11-25T17:11Z,"Armenian
Did you follow the instructions correctly?
could you try to reinstall it? (first uninstall l4d2 rev emu.)
I just deleted my l4d2 and reinstalled it and it worked fine, hopefully it will work for you too."
,Armenian,2010-11-25T17:43Z,"yes i did everything correctly, i reinstalled it but came the same problem"
,Junpoppa,2010-11-25T18:34Z,"Armenian
I reinstalled it again and got the same error.
Apparently you when installing ""L4D2_Rev_Emu_for_v2050+"" you SHOULDN'T CLICK ON ""view rev.ini"" and just click ""close"" if that works for you, you still can change your name by going to the folder where you've extracted the game. Click ""rev.ini"" and change http://bayimg.com/lAalmAadN
(don't delete the brackets) save the changes and launch left4dea2.exe HOPE THIS HELPED!
(note: when uninstalling L4D2_Rev_Emu_for_v2050+ click yes to all when asked to delete or write protected files)
by the way does anyone get the similar problem?"
,Armenian,2010-11-25T19:36Z,thanks for the comment)))) ill try it
,Armenian,2010-11-25T20:08Z,the same problem..... thx anyway
,smithy125,2010-11-25T20:09Z,"Sweet upload Junpoppa, just tried this found 66 servers in a matter of seconds, was one problem played the passing and CTD twice in differnet parts of game maybe cause i have the orginal on my Hard drive and steam installed, but neither were running at the time, but overall great upload and will be seeding for a while"
,Junpoppa,2010-11-25T20:44Z,"smithy125
Thank you very much. That actually means a lot to me since this is one of my first uploads and I didn't want to screw up! I'm happy to hear that you are able to play the game.
Armenian
I'm sorry hear that and I honestly don't know what else to do. Maybe you could try downloading other torrents and see if it works out. Good luck and sorry."
,ojdac,2010-11-25T20:52Z,wow this looks really good hope it works. i only want the game for online play anyway :)) thanks!!

,schlanske,2010-11-25T23:26Z,"Thanks 1K!
worked like a charm on a virgin W7 32bit system here.

- simply extract
- install Addon Support
- install Rev Emu and exit without opening the rev.ini.
- edit rev.ini
- play the game - even on group servers ; D

best torrent so far for me!

thank you junpoppa ***

sorry all :(  "
,MonstaBlakaz,2010-11-28T18:52Z,"failed to load the launcher DLL
ERROR
HELP!!!!!!!!!!!"
,Junpoppa,2010-11-28T19:31Z,"MonstaBlakaz, I'll explain everything now and if you have done something differently then delete the left 4 dead 2 folder and extract the rar folder again.

.You MUST Download THIS torrent and extract rar file.
There should be 2 folders
 Left 4 dead 2 > l4d2 (l4d2 folder should be inside left 4 dead 2 folder)
Then download the other torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5993523
Extract it somewhere ELSE. you should get folder named ""upload""
 INSIDE it should be 2 applications:
 rar file and L4D2 UPDATE 2051 to 2052.
 FIRST, install the UPDATE and SAVE it in l4d2 folder (mentioned above)
THEN extract the rar file ALSO in l4d2 folder.
THEN just run the game! tell me if that works and I'll tell you how to change your name afterwards!"

,MonstaBlakaz,2010-11-29T12:00Z,"Junpoppa, how to fix it
