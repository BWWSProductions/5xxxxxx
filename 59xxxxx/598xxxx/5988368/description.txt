The Gift is more than a seasonal listening experience, it has become firmly established as the basis for numerous joyful Christmas events, indoors or outdoors and is widely used as a kind of 'Christmas party for Jesus'. 

A resource of seasonal songs to help build bridges to those for whom the Christmas story has little relevance today
