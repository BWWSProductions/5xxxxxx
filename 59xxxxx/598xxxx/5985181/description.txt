Me, Myself and Why? â€“ Mary Janice Davidson

Sweet and innocent with a twist of girl-next-door, Cadence Jones is not your typical girl and certainly not your typical FBI agent. Just ask her sisters, Shiro and Adrienne. (Waitâ€¦ best if you donâ€™t ask Adrienne anything.) But itâ€™s her special â€œtalentâ€ which makes Cadence so valuable to the FBI, and it never comes in handier than when she and her partner, George, get tagged to bring down the Threefer Killer. A serial killer who inexplicably likes to kill in threes, leave behind inexplicable newspaper clippings, and not one shred of decent forensic evidence, soon starts leaving messages that seem to be just for Cadence and her sisters. Could it be that this killer knows all about Cadenceâ€™s special â€œtalentâ€?
