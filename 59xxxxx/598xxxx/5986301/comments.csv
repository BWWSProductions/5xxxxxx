,SiRMarlon,2010-12-03T22:19Z,What a retarded way of ripping a movie...
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-04T00:00Z,"@SiRMarlon - What a retarded comment from someone that has no uploads themselves, yet is the expert."
,jauser,2010-12-04T00:58Z,"yep, wtf is this, .iso? this ain't no rip"
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-04T01:23Z,"Precisely, jauser - I wouldn't expect someone of your mentality to know what a hi-def .iso was, or to be able to read to further their knowledge, so move along."
,Azi91,2010-12-07T08:12Z,Burned!
,MMPHC2,2010-12-24T14:26Z,"Sorry 4 this,but I'll wait for the mkv version.Thx anyway"
,stinky1,2010-12-28T00:17Z,"The negative comments are ill informed and quite frankly, fucked up!!
This and all HD-R-US's work is extremely well done and makes perfect sense.
Burn the fucking movie on a DVD-5 and play it on a blu ray...works for me."
,one3rd,2011-01-03T17:24Z,any ideas for mac burning?
,djbigshot,2011-01-11T17:05Z,your stuff is always great i really dont get how anyone can write any negative comments learn to use your burner  people thks again.
,ThereICK,2011-01-14T13:48Z,"You Rock HD R US.  

To all the idiots.  
1. Get VLC Player.
2. Double Click ISO file.
3. Double Click BDMV folder.
4. Double Click Stream Folder.
5. Double  0000.m2ts 
6. Use VLC Player to play 0000.m2ts file

THAT IS HOW YOU WATCH IT DIRECTLY ON YOUR COMPUTER"
,malibu0264,2011-02-05T06:01Z,"Works great, thank you!"
,CoolGonzo,2011-04-03T23:52Z,@SiRMarlon & jauser - You guys have no clue what you are talking about... HD-R-US has some of the best HD rips on piratebay.  Just because you two imbeciles don't know how to play the iso's doesn't give you the right to criticize anyone.  Keep up the great work HD-R-US.
,joernabe,2011-08-22T01:34Z,to all idiot fuckers... just dont visit the page of HD-R-US.. you guys are fools.. disappear!!!
