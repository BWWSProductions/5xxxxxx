Her very much loved, and she accurately associated with ÑÑ‚Ñ€ÐµÐ»ÑÐ»ÐºÐ°Ð¼Ð¸ about World War II. Then has come Call of Duty and has shown that "Medal" is much weaker than her. Further some years of a competition and an unconditional victory of "debt CallÂ», fixed by two control shots â€” Modern Warfare 1-2.

As a result Â«debt CallÂ» has started to compete to itself, and bosses Activision already thought of construction of new office from gold and diamonds. But EA all this time bore the plan to sweep. She watched closely the opponent, studied his tactics of fight, has enlisted in the numbers of skilled officers (DICE), has created division for special operations (Danger Close) and couple of weeks has passed in resolute approach which should erase word combination Modern Warfare from memory of civilians back. You see in the name the first letter Â«MÂ» â€” you think about Medal of Honor!
