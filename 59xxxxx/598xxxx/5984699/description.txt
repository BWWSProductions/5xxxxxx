We compete for jobs and, the more desirable the job, the tougher the competition. Most people readily understand this. But, Nathan Bennett and Stephen A. Miles suggest that fewer people recognize how the pursuit of an open job can be framed as one "move" in a multifaceted game called "a career." The authors contend that individuals who quickly recognize the career game for what it isâ€”a fascinating, complex, nuanced, real-life, multiplayer maze, played in real timeâ€”can develop into better players and, consequently, will have a better chance of successfully competing for the sort of positions that will help them to realize their goals.
