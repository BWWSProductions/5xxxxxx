,FatAdZ,2011-01-17T00:32Z,"This isn't the full thing!

I'm joking, this is the entirety of their studio discography. If you want everything they've done you'll need to download their live stuff aswell."
,steinburger1109,2011-01-19T03:41Z,"Hey, thanks for all this man, it's all good, and I will seed! One note, Hold Your Color has a whole bunch of artists on the songs, which isn't necessarily a big deal. The other note is that all the songs on Hold Your Color are 320 kbps, In Silico is all 192 kbps, and Immersion is all 256 kbps. I'm not sure what all that is about, but I really wanted this stuff, and it was a fast download. Works for me. Thanks again, woolly."

,asolexrider,2011-04-18T21:02Z,Thank you!!! works fine.
,Johnneeeh,2011-06-15T22:31Z,"Nice, seeding. 

By the way, it is actually the full studio discography, they have done more live but you'll have to download that from another source."
,UnbalancedTime,2011-07-14T21:59Z,Thank you very much for the torrent!  I'm just discovering them.
,UnderWillis,2011-09-22T23:52Z,"Best quality of ""In Silico"" I've found! Thanks woollytorrent!!!"
