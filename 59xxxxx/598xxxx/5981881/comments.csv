Don't mean to seem an idiot, I just have not seen a Rip tagged like this one is? PPV (I thought that stood for Plasma Pyrolysis Vitrification - PPV its a means of disposing of all kinds of waste products from medical to radioactive to municipal waste) google if you have any doubt or questions as far as Plasma Pyrolysis Vitrification. THANKS?"
