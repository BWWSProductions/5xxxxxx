"Poison" is a song by American recording artist Nicole Scherzinger, released from October 25, 2010 as the first single from as-of-yet untitled debut album. The track was added to Radio 1's B-Playlist in the United Kingdom.

MTV's Gil Kaufman called the video "slinky". Directed by Joseph Kahn, the music video for "Poison" sees Scherzinger "sporting a skintight ninja outfit as she dance-fights with baddies." The video has a superhero theme while it shows Nicole Scherzinger fighting 'bad guys' and puts them behind bars, changing in a telephone booth before jetting around town on her BMW motorcycle.

Robbie Daw from Idolator, said that "[we were] unsure about [...] 'Poison' when it first surfaced. But now that itâ€™s been fitted with a somewhat stylish Joseph Kahn video, itâ€™s all sort of starting to fall into place. 'Poison' video is super hot trash on a budget." French magazine "Musique Mag", said that "[...] varying scenes, and fighting against thugs become [a] frenzied choreography.

In 2007 Scherzinger was planning to launch her debut album under the title Her Name is Nicole. It was preceeded by the release of four singles singles "Whatever You Like" (featuring T.I.), "Baby Love (featuring will.i.am), "Puakenikeni" and "Supervillain" but all failed to significantly impact on US charts. "Baby Love" was moderately successful reaching top-twenty in Europe. After a number of pushbacks the entire project was scrapped at the request of Scherzinger. She told X magazine:

    "It was my choice to not put out the album. I wasn't dropped. In fact, a lot of my solo songs went on the second Pussycat Dolls album Doll Domination so I'm happy that people were able to hear songs like 'Happily Never After' and 'When I Grow Up'. The song 'I Hate This Part' was originally for my solo album, too.

In May 2010, Rap-Up reported that Scherzinger was relaunching her solo career with an "empowering" ballad called "Nobody Can Change Me", The song was recorded in a nightime studio session while she was competing on season ten of U.S. reality competition, Dancing with the Stars and was mastered on May 23, 2010 ready for its premiere on Ryan Seacrest's KIIS FM radio show the following day. Idolator was unimpressed with the "treacly pop tune" saying that the lack of sexiness, "uninspiring message" and "squeaky vocals" did Scherzinger no favors. However Amos Barshad of New York magazine actually liked the song stating that "thereâ€™s none of the Pussycat Dollâ€™s forced sexiness here; instead, it sounds like something that could have just missed the final cut on a Kelly Clarkson album (that is sort of supposed to be a compliment, yeah)."

Then in August 2010 Swedish electropop producer RedOne was interviewed by the BBC. In the interview he revealed he had been working on Scherzinger's album. "I just finished her album. Her last one never came out because it was collecting hamburgers, like fast food. One from McDonalds, one from Burger King, and so on. It tasted good, but it wasn't consistent. Her new record - people are really going to go crazy about it because it's the real her."
