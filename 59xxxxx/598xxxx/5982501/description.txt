Sorry, I don't have the EPs.

Note: I did not rip these, so far from what I've listened to the quality is good but if there are bad tracks don't blame me. I figured I'd make a torrent for all three because there weren't many torrents for the discs and the one I found on TPB for What the Toll Tells had DRM protected files.
