""Don't believe anything unless you can prove it with your own research"" is definitely a motto I live by daily now. Even when my father tells me things about politics or my family members attempt to inform me on ""facts"" I simply state ""That is interesting, but I can't believe it unless I research it and come to an irrefutable conclusion about it"".

Bill Is still my hero and role model that I model much of my life after. He inspires in me Courage, Truth, Wisdom, and Knowledge. His UFO/Alien tour was shaky at best but I is my personal opinion that this was a learning curve to him.

Through listening to 100's of hours of Cooper talk and give his personal viewpoitns on things, he comes across to me as generally a nice guy, respectful and kind unless you intentionally piss him off. That's alright, I can handle the ""No bs"" kind of guys.

Either that or he is truly the master of deception. But I am starting the journey to verify much of what he claims on his shows and so far, I haven't even come close to having anything that would suggest he was wrong."

Cooper had a way about making you feel dumb,  even with things you thought you already knew, to the point it hurt the listeners ego, which made you want to go look it up.  I care not if the man drank a little or was a total drunk.  Personal attacks are only ways to strip down the man, not the research.  Hope you all enjoy these recordings as much as i do."
