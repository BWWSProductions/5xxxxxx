This is my William Cooper archives, its taken me years to collect all of this and listen to and name according to the HOTT cassette catalogue.  they are named with the cassette # and dated to best of my ability. if i could not identify the episode it is labeled as such.  i cant take full cred for this collection, so i would like to take the time to thank everyone who has ever shown interest in uploading any of the cooper material: Fugazi, Sheldon Day, Red Gonzo, shortwave, Reboot, ioslo, vagabonder, DJ Redrum, the don, skalpsolo, and anyone else i forgot.  This collection is massive, and i hope i will get alot of help seeding cause my upload speed sux.  enjoy.  mr cooper changed my life in so many different ways, so thanks to him and RIP.

...this is labeled audio, but it does contain a folder of pictures, a few hour of the time episodes in pdf form, and VERITAS #1, which was bill's full sized newspaper.
