,travishb2,2010-11-28T22:12Z,"The difference yopepoy is they are two different people. secretmyth belongs to a release group, called Kingdom. hence the ""kingdom-release"". It looks like hdlite is a solo artist."

,vivatpb5776,2012-06-27T17:25Z,"Quality is good; however, I cannot seem to find a version that has either embedded subs or a separate .srt file for the non-English parts. At the very least, there are two scenes in the beginning that would warranty this. If anyone has come across this, please comment."
