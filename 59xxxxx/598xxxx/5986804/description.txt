Ernest Ranglin O.D. (born June 19, 1932 in Manchester, Jamaica) is a Jamaican guitarist and composer. Best known for his session work at the famed Studio One, Ranglin helped give birth to the ska genre in the late 1950s. Some credit Ranglin with the invention of the core style of guitar play (sometimes known as "scratching") found in nearly all ska music.

Ranglin played on many classic Jamaican recordings, and he performed with artists such as Jimmy Cliff, Monty Alexander, Prince Buster, The Skatalites and the Eric Deans Orchestra. He has also explored other styles of music, notably blending jazz and reggae.
