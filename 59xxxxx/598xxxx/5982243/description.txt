Born Carol Klein (she added the "e" to her first name) in 1942 to a Jewish household 
in Manhattan, New York, King grew up in Brooklyn and started out playing piano and 
moved on to singing, forming a vocal quartet called the Co-Sines at James Madison 
High School. As a teenager dreaming of having a successful entertainment career, 
she decided to give herself a new last name, stumbling upon "King" in the telephone book. 
She attended Queens College, where she was a classmate (and girlfriend) of Neil 
Sedaka and inspired Sedaka's first hit, "Oh! Carol." She responded with "Oh! Neil" 
and "Will You Love Me Tomorrow." At Queens College, she befriended Paul Simon and Gerry Goffin

Fantasy is an album by American singer-songwriter Carole King, released in 1973. 
This time King wrote all the songs herself. At the time of its release, it only 
reached #6 on the Billboard album chart, but has remained highly regarded by her 
fans over the ensuing decades. One of the tracks of the album is a song called 
"Haywood" which is about drug addiction.

The Spanish language track "CorazÃ³n" (the Spanish word for "heart," also used as 
a term of endearment, as in this song's lyrics) was a moderate hit single from the album, 
as was "Believe in Humanity." The flip side of the latter single, "You Light Up My Life" 
(not the Debby Boone hit), charted separately from its A-side.
