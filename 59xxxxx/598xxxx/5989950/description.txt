Otis Ray Redding, Jr. [September 9, 1941 ~ December 10, 1967] was an
American soul singer. Often called the 'King of Soul', he is renowned for an
ability to convey strong emotion through his voice. According to the website of
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame [where he was inducted in 1989], Redding's
name is "synonymous with the term soul, music that arose out of the black
experience in America through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm and
blues into a form of funky, secular testifying." In addition, rock critic Jon Landau
said in 1967, "Otis Redding is rock & roll". Redding died in a plane crash at the
age of 26, one month before his biggest hit, "[Sittin' On] The Dock of the Bay",
was released.
