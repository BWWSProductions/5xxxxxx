_____________________________________________________

Jan Hammer is a Czech-born keyboard player best known for the theme
from the Miami Vice TV series.

Hammer's early career was with a jazz fusion group, the Mahavishnu
Orchestra.

He played keyboards for the Mahavishnu until 1973, playing on their two
critically acclaimed albums Inner Mounting Flame and Birds of Fire.

After leaving the Orchestra he worked with a number of collaborators,
including Carlos Santana and Stanley Clarke, and released several critically
acclaimed and commercially successful jazz rock albums with Jeff Beck.

Of their releases, the platinum selling Wired was the most successful, although
a later collaboration with Beck, the track "Escape" from Flash, won Hammer the
Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental.

Despite his successful back catalogue, Hammer became better known for providing
scores for film and TV.

Producer Michael Mann asked him to provide the theme and incidental music for
the TV series Miami Vice.

The soundtrack album went to No.1 on the Billboard charts, sold four million
copies, and earned him two Grammys.

He went on to provide music for other series including Tales from the Crypt and
Knight Rider 2000.
