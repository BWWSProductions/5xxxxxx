Official Debut album for Mini Mansions released Nov 2, 2010 on Rekords Rekords / Ipecac records. Also has 2009 EP. Mini Mansions style has been compared to The Beatles, Elliott Smith and Fountains of Wayne.  Founded by Michael Shuman (QOTSA, Wires on Fire), Zach Dawes (Spinnerette) and Tyler Parkford.  

 Personally I will describe them as having Beach Boys and Beatlesque harmonies but with dark mysterious yet psychedelic underlying themes.   A throwback to the late 60\\\\\\\'s music but yet still feels fresh and current. I cant get enough. Has my vote for best album of 2010. A musical masterpiece  that unfortunately will most likely be overshadowed by the corporate ran music industry that I have come to hate.

Some reviews describing their sound-

It\\\\\\\'s not a difficult thing to describe the sound of Mini Mansions.  They are like a hybrid of The Beatles and Monsters of Folk: psychedelic, alternative, electronic, indie-all at the same time. And yet it isn\\\\\\\'t as simple as that, is it?  They have their own signature flavor peppered with electric guitars, buzzing synths, deep driving bass lines, pounding live drums (or sometimes simple muffled drum programming), ethereal vocals with just the right amount of reverb applied, not to mention excellent musicianship and writing.

Picture if you will, an astute crossover between Abbey Road, The White Album and Pet Sounds merged with John Lennon\\\\\\\'s solo work and Syd Barrett era Pink Floyd with hidden sublets of Radiohead and Blur.
