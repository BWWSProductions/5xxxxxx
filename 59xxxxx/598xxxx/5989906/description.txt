The Who are a four-piece mod/rock band whose first album, My Generation, bristled with attitude; the lyric "I hope I die before I get old" tapped into the disaffection felt by post-war baby boomers, helping to secure a loyal fanbase and establish the band at the forefront of the mod movement.

In the studio the band's innovative approach to recording helped to realise Townshend's vision and album and single success followed, notably taking the concept album to new heights in the shape of Tommy and Quadrophenia, both of which were made into successful films.

During live performances, including appearances at Woodstock and The Isle of Wight Festival, they became renowned for smashing their instruments, and at one point held the Guinness World Record for the loudest concert. Off-stage, they cemented their rock and roll reputation by wrecking hotel rooms and parking a Rolls Royce in a swimming pool.

The death of drummer Keith Moon saw the band separate in 1978, although, with Kenney Jones and Zak Starkey on drums, they reformed for one-off events, such as Live Aid in 1985. Plans to reform and produce new material were dealt another blow with the death of John Entwistle in 2002, although Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend still tour together as The Who. In 2006 Daltrey and Townshend released Endless Wire, the first Who album in 24 years.
