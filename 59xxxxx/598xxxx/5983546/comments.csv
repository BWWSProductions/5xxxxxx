,Dumass_88,2010-11-26T11:07Z,"What's been up with the late releases?

All big providers missed this totally, got mine down the 22d.

Why so late? In a bust or something?"
,Mercyflush64,2010-11-26T18:56Z,It's not late at all. They planned it this way so they could end their season with a holiday special.
,bogwart,2010-11-27T03:53Z,You think the season ends at #13?
,highvision,2010-12-01T00:36Z,"It is when all cable networks order anymore on shows is 7 or 14 episodes at most and call it a ""season"". So really it's half a season, while the other half is filled with another show they only ordered 14 episodes for. Networks maybe order 21-24 if it's a show like Lost, but never order more than 14 if it's a brand new show, and often only order 7 and pick up more shows if the ratings are decent. It's really sad, considering what shows like I Love Lucy did in a season, maybe around 50. What gets me is that SNL is a live show, yet they too only do 23 episodes. The writers can't come up with stuff week to week on a continuing basis? Stuff still happens in the word they can make fun of, things don't just stop. That's what they are paid for, totally bizarre. Apparently the real world does not apply to them, work more get paid the same, fall behind in life. Wish my life were like a copy writer or actor.."
,aldebaran91,2011-02-04T05:41Z,is there a fucking hiliday in US??cause none of the shows that i watch has come with new episode for the last 2 3 weeks
,ouch.jars,2011-03-12T15:55Z,"""Only"" 13 episodes? UK TV series are normally 6 or 12 episodes long"
