,buzzmeupplz,2010-11-29T04:58Z,Any way you could upload resident evil degeneration?
,ninjasource,2011-01-30T10:29Z,"Excellent upload!!! :-)

at first i thought 1,5GB per movie would result in bad quality for 720p - but i was wrong.

The Video/Sound quality is SURPRISINGLY EXCELLENT!!! :-)
...although not as good as 4,4GB 720p movies.

apparantly 720p 1,5GB looks very good, so take 720p instead of 480p 1,4GB - unless u want to play it on a cellphone/pda that only supports 480p."
,ninjasource,2011-01-30T10:33Z,"1500 MB movies in 720p looks surprissingly good!

Great upload!"
,Hongster45654,2011-03-15T19:09Z,Are the subtitles optional or is it recommended? What I'm trying to say is: are there any parts in the movies where they don't speak english and I need subtitles to understand?
,Hongster45654,2011-03-18T00:53Z,How do I get the subtitles to work?
