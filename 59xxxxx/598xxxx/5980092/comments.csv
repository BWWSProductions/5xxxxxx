,supermereal,2010-11-24T08:13Z,"Man this is going 15fps on your pc!that's bad,need's to be 60fps to be playable!!!
It's need a quad and 580gtx and maybe than maybe will be playable."
,turtlespeed,2010-11-24T11:29Z,Is this PAL?
[V],globeplus,2010-11-24T12:36Z,"To supermereal : i was recording at the same time but the gameplay is absolutly nice , don´t really need to be 60 fps , but must be this emulator version or close and with the included configuration : because for some reason that is not simple to explain the latest emulators versions are not working properly for this game , so ... getting this game perfectly playable in a nice way it is already positive ..."

[V],globeplus,2010-11-24T13:10Z,"IMPORTANT TIP to the emulators users : if the game get any problem on the load , close the emulator and try again , in last case if necessary restrat the computer and then use the emulator , because this version and generally speaking it is necessary more free ram as possible to the load of the game be better as possible and the key for this game be ok to use is when after the normal wii presentation the 1st menu says : PRESS A AND B TO PLAY , not press any key on the wiimote , when this message happen , close the emulator and wait a few seconds and try again or restart the computer , you want on the 1st menu press A and B to play , then it is ok , it is like that with this game and this emulator version , i get the best possible for this game with the emulator and on this case my friendly users was a kind of tough task but with everything correct still very nice gameplay .

,Bmandred,2010-11-24T20:09Z,can anyone confirm if this one works on a pal wii with a wiikey 2 chip from dvd....
[V],globeplus,2010-11-25T09:46Z,"To master Fou : The used computer have 2 cores , 1 class nvidia video card , windows7-64bits , 4 gb ram and that doesnÂ´t really matter , computers with less ram sometimes can run certain games better , depending to the cinfiguration , now if you ask me : isthe configuration beeing correctly important to use this game ? and using exactly or close this verion of the emulator ? Well , both answers are yes and maybe the recording the video consumed some ram or cause any circunstancial interference but in a game that you need specific versions of the emulator all the supositions are not really relevant , i mean if you get everything perfect running the game , i repeat : is already positive , so emulators players donÂ´t be obcecated with the computer specs but of course that 1 gb ram a medium range video card and sometimes a computer restart can help running the games and using the emulator ... Happy gaming and just enjoy the ride ..."
[V],globeplus,2010-11-25T11:49Z,"Hi again this file users , i did some important research in order to afinate the configuration and getting the correct idea about the consumed ram running a game by the emulator :

1ST - IMPORTANT TIP : with a slight chabge on the configuration the framerate can improve and slight probkems running the game , i get clean 35 fps on the same place playing with the video in 15 with the next slight change :
go to Config\ and click in the Use FPS for limiting then set the maximum framerate for 60 fps , looks like with this frame limiter not clicked in normal OFF mode for this emulator version , the answer of the video framerate is a little bit more difficult but ok , for other side with the frame limiter on looks likethe framerate improve on the stability for this particular game , so USE THIS TIP !!!

Now , if someone wants to kill me after what i have to say next , i understand but really comproved with a nice RAM program , running this game on the emulator takes something like between 300 and 400 mb ram MAXIMUM !!! No JOKE and anyone with doubts on this subject can take the conclusion for himself with a nice ram program out there , ok guys , follow my useful tip and LEAVE THE REST OF THE CONFIGURATION LIKE IT IS , only use the tip and choose new keys or gamepad config if wanted , thatÂ´s all .

HAPPY GAMING !!!

,doubleKO,2010-11-29T05:00Z," Props globe, where's your green skull already?

Thanks for saving me from downloading gigabytes of worthless zeroes, I wish I had discovered your magnificent work sooner. This technique that gets the file size down to less than half the wbfs size is amazing! Thankyou. Your directplay PC titles look nice and small too, I will be checking those out in future. Yes doubters! Globe's Wii for PC releases are fully compatible with chipped and softmodded Wiis. Through the magic of compression you will end up with an iso that is exactly 4,589,824 KB which can be burnt to DVD-R (or easily converted to wbfs and run from a USB loader)."
,doubleKO,2010-11-29T05:18Z,"My bad, not less than half the wbfs. The wbfs size for this one is just under 3GB, so it is reduced by about one third. Most upload the full disc size though and that still leaves you about 2.5GB in front. GLOBE!"
[V],def35,2010-11-30T20:28Z,it's will burn to 69% and ten holds it off to burn it. somthing is wrong white that iso;
,Shoobox,2010-12-05T13:36Z,"in your video it took your over 6 minutes to extract winrar file at 1.9gb,
use peazip it took less than a minute."
,SamAsh07,2010-12-06T15:14Z,"What is removed from this Torrent? Why don't you ever point out?? Like in Sonic Colors there's no audio in cutscenes which makes the game useless...
new technique?? If there is, why don't others use it?? To those who played it, can you atleast let me know what is ripped from this game? Or is it full??"
,SamAsh07,2010-12-08T07:57Z,"Well I JUST played it, nothing seems to have been removed BUT, but but....the cutscenes seem to stutter for 1-2 seconds every 5-10 seconds."
,k9chilly55,2011-01-06T03:42Z,does this work on US wii???
,kami8080,2011-01-19T21:00Z,globe the king of rips.fuck those who dont respect ur work. u r way beyond that.some bitches are disrespectful.dontwaste ur time replying them.  U ROCK U ROCK.
,73045,2011-03-19T04:13Z,"Okay, here's my experience with this release.
To begin with I had my doubts about the release size, but decided to take a leap of faith.

First off, you need at least 16GB free on your hard drive to extract and play around with the files. And heaps of time to let the processes run and do their thing.
I downloaded this, followed the instructions and had a good ISO.
Next I ran it through the WiiBackupManager and obtained a WBFS file.
Loaded this up via CFG v65 and got it running on a 4.2E PAL softmodded wii.
No problems at all, game runs smoothly and all looks good.

Thanks for the wonderful compression - my bandwidth is limited to 30 GB a month so smaller releases are my preference! Great job by globeplus!!!"
,mikche,2011-07-14T12:07Z,I'm using dolphin emulator and I have a problem with sound. When I start playing first level of the game sound works fine with the occasional crackle and soon after that disappears. There is only background music and a few sounds of enemies. Does anyone else have this problem? Please help !!
,Espana25,2011-10-31T04:36Z,Sound issues for me too after first stage the music disappears and some strange noises come along with no possible fix so far i guess only SFX is fine in the background somewhat but the music is crippled with weird noises after 1st stage any fixes to this ?
