5. Frequently asked idiotic questions
-------------------------------------

No matter how i try to make things simple and fool proof people still manage to come and ask some pretty stupid questions
Here is answers for the most of the idiotic questions i manage to get on my torrents:

Yes, this game works in windows 7
This game is meaned for 32 bit version of windows
Make sure your PC even can handle this game (check the System requirements above)
Make sure you have installed DirectX 9c, .NET Framework(s)
Make sure your windows is updated including .NET framework(s)
Make sure your video/audio card drivers are up to date
Make sure you have readed wiki how to play this game
Make sure no other aplication interfears with the game (AntiVirus/firewall/antispyware/etc)
Read mod info BEFORE you apply mod to game with Illusion Wizzard

All stupid questions like "How do i install this", "How do i play/insert/etc" and so on will be ignored.
