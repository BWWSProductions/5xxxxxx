,Wild669,2010-11-27T00:45Z,"Looks like my praying was heard by the gods! Though I already got SBZ and the HF patch, I surely will get this all-in-one! I'll probably re-install SBZ. Because it's an .iso I just need to extract it and install, no needing to burn/mount. Thank you, Master of The Installs of Illusion, for one more great work! :-)"

But seriously, no matter how foolproof you try and make something, someone, somewhere, somehow, WILL find a way to break it.

Thanks, great upload! Love you long time."

,afgaviria,2011-01-25T20:50Z,"@rp
maybe it sounds weird but i dont do anything different, i have my drivers up to date with DRIVER EASY, and im always checking for the latest directx updates.

I just click on autorun of your beautiful done setups (click on accept, next and finish)  and wait 3 or 5 min for the install to  finish, thats it, thats all that I can remember. oohh and windows update got me covered with the latest net frameworks (i dont know if the games use those but i saw it in your explanations)"
,Cidron_2,2011-01-26T17:18Z,"I also installed this on a W7/64 bit machine, worked straight off the box. I used Daemon Tools (lite), didn't burn a DVD. I have 9 Illusion games working on this machine now, all heavily modded, all working 101%. Most games came from randompirate's torrents. Excellent work you do, sir!
For mods see http://www.hongfire.com
and be amazed...
P.S. Do NOT install the(se) games to C:\Program files\***! Install to what they suggest (C:\Games\Illusion\*** or just C:\Illusion\***."
,asdf23233,2011-02-13T22:57Z,"Before I install, is there an uninstaller? or do I just delete the folder?"
