Penny's father, Wyatt, is in Pasadena for a visit. Leonard learns that Penny told her father that she and Leonard got back together again, as Leonard is the one and only of her boyfriends of who he has ever approved. Leonard agrees to go along with the ruse, but much against Penny's chagrin, he does so on his terms and not hers. But what would happen if Wyatt found out the truth? Sheldon, believing that Leonard and Penny have indeed gotten back together, decides to amend their roommate agreement to compensate for the Penny factor. Meanwhile, Raj has finally been allocated time to monitor a high powered telescope for twelve hours, and he invites Howard along, who in turn invites Bernadette. Raj is initially peeved at Bernadette's presence since he he doesn't feel like he can drink (to be able to speak to her) and monitor the telescope at the same time. Raj makes the decision to consume alcohol.
