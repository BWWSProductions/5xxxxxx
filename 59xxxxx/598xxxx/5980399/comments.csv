,daniello67,2011-03-28T13:25Z,there is a problem with audio track.
,Groovejet,2012-06-21T11:40Z,"Warning:
The original movie was cut down from 2.39:1 to 2.35:1 for blu ray. This uploader has cut it down again to 16x9. 
In a few years time when all TV's are 2.35:1 you are going to have to download these movies all over again. Look for a 2.35:1 torrent instead."
