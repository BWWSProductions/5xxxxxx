,R_O_M_D,2010-11-24T07:24Z,is this one legit? and is this the crack that is the same as earlier ones?
,megodtoo,2010-11-24T07:42Z,"It is,
Only trouble i had when I installed was,  I had to completely reinstall the game...Apply the Update 1070, then applied the patch. Let Windows games live update complete...then it worked. You have to make a shortcut to the GTA loader. The patch below 1070 wants to remove GTA Social club...if installed...let it. Then it will want to install games for Windows live. let it completely download and update.  I had the Original GTA IV with patch. So depend on what version you have it may require a Different path. But it Does work. "

,gunmaker,2010-12-05T15:53Z,"new notice for distributers and to ALL TORRENT USERS

anti p2p organizations are now ddosing users and sending invalidated data OR VIRUSES into our torrents!!

this chocking of our extending seeding is halt !! -able!

download 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/peerblock/files/PeerBlock-Setup_v1.1_r518.exe/download

and prevent most of them from choking you, and rapidsearch for a non viral loic.exe so u can legally retaliate against them!
(ps if u do get a viraled loic.exe u can simply prune the viruses before u reboot, they sit in the main program files menu and a funny looking icon in there as well as your temp folders. simply delete them before rebooting.

THIS IS THE FUCKING PIRATE BAY! WE DONT TAKE CRAP FROM SCALLYWAGS! YARrRrR!"
,Damien74,2010-12-17T22:42Z,Anti p2p does NOT send viruses lol. That's illegal! Virus programmers do it for fun.. cause they think they are being funny. A whole other deal.
,doradhorror,2010-12-31T09:50Z,"gunmaker, you're hella retarded

bittorrent programs have hash checks and loic is a fucking botnet"
,ultamanl,2011-01-20T17:35Z,thnx man! it works!
,redbywo,2011-02-09T00:49Z,LIVE keeps asking to sign in (and a serial)  whenever I try to save my progress. Any way to avoid this?
,W4V3,2011-02-11T14:33Z,"working perfectly with the 1.0.7.0 patch download from the oficial site used in my ArenaBG GTA IV, thank you very much"
,sonofadouche,2011-02-19T21:06Z,Is it necessary to install previous patches such as 1.0.4.0 before installing 1.0.7.0?
,sonofadouche,2011-02-19T23:06Z,"OK this is kind of whack. I had the game running fine with patch 1.0.4.0 and the corresponding crack except it was a bit laggy. 

I uninstalled/reinstalled the game and tried to apply patch 1.0.7.0 but it will not install. 

I got the patch directly from the Rockstar site because I cannot find it anywhere else. I was really hoping this patch would fix my lag issue.

Anyone have any ideas what the problem is?

For now I am going back to patch 1.0.4.0"
,sonofadouche,2011-02-19T23:11Z,Oops...nevermind. I figured what I was doing wrong. 
,Philonetic,2011-03-05T10:38Z,"Best thing you can do is stop at 1.0.4.0
1.0.7.0 has lag issues, and is also not compatible with most mods.
1.0.4.0 is the best right now."
,Philonetic,2011-03-05T10:50Z,"DONT PATCH PAST 1.0.4.0
Most mods are not compatible with anything past 1.0.4.0
All patches after 1.0.4.0 have overloaded protocols and lag harder."
,flames_of_mordor,2011-04-10T17:40Z,its working fine for me but i just cant find out how i can load my saved game. could someone tell me were i can move those files? ive already checked windows live folder but found no folder for users.
,muzaffar0830,2011-05-22T10:43Z,the file is password protected
,megodtoo,2011-10-06T06:18Z,"muzaffar0830, File is not password protected. you just need a programme like http://www.winzip.com/trialpay.htm?sc_cid=go_au_nb_comp_Jzip
or http://www.7-zip.org/ or Another to unzip it :)"
,Torrentsfan,2012-05-11T14:52Z,"Thanks, worked perfectly."
,security55,2012-06-06T18:53Z,IF THIS WORKS ILL RATE UP
