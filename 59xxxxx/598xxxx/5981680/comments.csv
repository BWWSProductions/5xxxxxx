,nabbit66,2010-11-26T16:00Z,very poor quality
,lvzardoz,2010-11-27T04:09Z,"Perhaps nabbit66 does not understand that most of this video was shot way back in the 1970s.

Considering that the upload was under 600KB and still was almost 2 hours long, the quality is good enough when considering the age of the original material.

From such old video sources, you can't expect HD quality.  Even if you bought it on DVD, I doubt that it would satisfy people who are used to today's higher video standards.

It is a tradeoff - one that works for me.  If you want better quality, buy the DVD or download files that are several times larger.  For me, I appreciate the faster downloads of smaller files.
I guess I am lucky not to be so picky."

This video is available as a 720x480 mpeg file but the file size is 6 times bigger and so the download will be 6 times slower.  Both options are good depending upon your needs.  "
