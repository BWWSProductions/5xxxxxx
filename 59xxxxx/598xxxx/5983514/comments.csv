,Daker9,2010-11-28T19:02Z,Seed for Krissake. I have created and shared this torrent to a ratio of 4 and so far everyone downloads and kills the torrent. If there are lot of seeders on a torrent okay but if its new then be decent and seed back for a while. Be nice not an ass!
,renner8,2011-02-12T11:42Z,"Thanks for the upload.  Saw glimpses of this on SET, can't wait to watch it."
,flatlander30,2011-02-16T06:57Z,"If someone will keep seeding it, I'll take over and seed it up to 5X. Seriously, can't let this one die! It's the last one. Thanks!"
