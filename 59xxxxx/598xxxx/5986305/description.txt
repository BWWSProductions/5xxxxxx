Beady Eye are an English rock band that formed in 2009. Following the departure of guitarist, vocalist and songwriter Noel Gallagher from Oasis, the rest of the members decided to end the band and form a new one in its place, retaining vocalist Liam Gallagher, guitarist Gem Archer, bassist Andy Bell (who switched to the role of guitarist)[1] and drummer Chris Sharrock.[2][3] Matt Jones and Jeff Wootton will also join Beady Eye as live keyboardist and bassist respectively.[4]

The band began writing and recording new material as early as November 2009,[5] and released their debut track, "Bring the Light" on 15 November 2010,[6] which will be followed by a full-length studio album in 2011 produced by Steve Lillywhite.[2][7] It was revealed on the band's official website on 9 November 2010 that "Bring the Light" would be made available as a free digital download from 10 November 2010, as well as being released as a limited edition 7" vinyl single. All 4,000 7" vinyl copies sold out on the day they went on sale. The 7" vinyl also includes a b-side called "Sons of the Stage" originally recorded by World of Twist.[6] On 23rd November 2010 Beady Eye announced a short European tour for March 2011 including six dates in the UK. Tickets are released on the 26th November, 2010 at 10am. Bring the Light entered UK Indie chart at number 16.
