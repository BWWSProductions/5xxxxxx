,crapp6669,2010-11-28T15:51Z,any chance of getting this without the hard-coded dutch subs?
,uwabaki,2010-11-28T19:32Z,"I would also like to see this without the hardcoded subs. Not against having subs, but soft subs would be a good compromise for all."
[V],MeMar,2010-11-29T12:48Z,@uwabaki: not if you want to see this on TV!
