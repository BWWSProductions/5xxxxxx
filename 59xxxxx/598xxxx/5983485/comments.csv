,killedsweetness,2010-12-03T05:13Z,This isn't working on my PS3......friggin Cinavia DRM.....is there any way around it??????
,boort1980,2010-12-08T03:16Z,"Hi HD-R-US, 
amazing quality upload - really appreciate your efforts. Am i permitted to ask how you create the .iso for playback on AVCHD machines? I have a number of H.264 and MKV files - just no success in doing what you have done - I know the stream needs to be converted to .m2ts but nothing seems to work (except for your uploads)
Thanks again"
,killedsweetness,2010-12-10T02:07Z,"Alright, I get it's probably a newb question....my bad....but it's been almost a week....can anyone help me out?"
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-10T03:54Z,"Hi killedsweetness - probably noone has responded because there is no definite way around Cinavia protection at this moment in time, which is now being added to all the disks that Sony Pictures distribute. There are a few tips and tricks if you Google it, but some claim they work, and others say they don't.

If you have a home network, you can still mount/stream their movies to your PS3 with no problem."
,red4ngel,2010-12-15T06:10Z,can u burn this to a dvd?? just asking
,pc_nerd,2010-12-19T04:32Z,"Yes you can using an ISO burner like ImgBurn or Infra Recorder, or even the built in Windows 7 ISO burner. But due to the filestructure the DVD has to be played on an AVCHD compatible BluRay player."
,pc_nerd,2010-12-23T08:10Z,"Once again, AV 10/10 but remember to check your writable media. My DVD was already scratched so it was a little dodgy."
,EvilCorporateWhore,2011-01-01T15:37Z,"Wow. This was so easy to d/l and burn onto DVD... and plays beautifully on BluRay, of course with great quality.

I hope you upload more in this format. Thanks."
,PanzerVitch,2011-01-10T02:20Z,"How do I add the subs if I am planing on watching it on the PC or converting it to another video format?

Btw, of all the movies I have ever downloaded from TPB, this one has the best quality. I am already downloading more of your movies.

Thanks,
PanzerVitch"
,stephenjrthomas,2011-01-12T01:18Z,"Hey, look,. i'm a dude and you're probably one too. but is it okay to say that i love you? i mean, i really love you whoever you are. Great job and fantastic quality!!!!!!!"
,PanzerVitch,2011-01-12T02:06Z,"Can someone explain me how to add the subtitles in the PC, or at least which is the subtitle file?

This is my first Blu-Ray movie, so I need some help

Thanks,
PanzerVitch"
,PanzerVitch,2011-01-13T01:29Z,"It says I have to add the subs externally, how do I do that.

If I play it in a blu-ray player will it have subs, and why only in the blu-ray player?"
[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-14T06:00Z,"PanzerVitch - you don't need to add the subtitles that are listed for burning/playing in a blu-ray player - they are already included. You would only add .srt format subtitless externally if played on a computer, because media players do not detect PGS stream subtitles at the moment, although some developers are working on it. I hope this helps."
,PanzerVitch,2011-01-15T00:33Z,"Thank you very much, so If I burn it into a DVD and play it in a blu-ray player the subs will be included but if I want to watch it on a PC I have to look for the subs myself in some website?"
,PanzerVitch,2011-01-16T03:12Z,Is there any chance you can upload the .STR subtitles for this movie and the Godfather trilogy? I am planning on buying a blu-ray player but It will be a couple of months before I do so (I live in Venezuela and I am not sure that the blu-ray players here are compatible with american blu-ray movies and so on)
,Crazy_Mas,2011-01-18T19:55Z,"FOR THE PS3 USERS:

Cinavia blocked audio to all disks that Sony Pictures distribute. 

Solution: PS3 > settings > WMA playback disable!


Good luck and have fun watching the movie WITH audio ;)"
,dolphinsmarlins1,2011-01-19T03:33Z,"I appreciate the work that you put into this, but I am having trouble playing this on vlc media player.  I don't want to burn it to a disk; instead, I want to play it with the computer via hdmi to the television.  Any suggestions would be much appreciated."
[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-21T00:53Z,"PanzerVitch - You'll find .srt format subtitles for all of our releases on the following site - just search for ""HD-R-US"": www*divxsubtitles*net (replace the stars with periods).

dolphinsmarlins1 - Just mount the disk image with Daemon Tools virtual drive, or extract the files/folders with a late version of PowerISO, and stream the video file with VLC Media Player."
,sky_24,2011-01-27T13:06Z,why aint the subs working for the russian parts? playing it on VLC Playr and KM Player no subs :(
,sky_24,2011-01-27T13:08Z,why aint the subs working for the Russian parts? playing wiv VLC Player and KM Player
[T],L_Hammond,2011-01-27T14:24Z,"Really great quality. Thanks for sharing!

I don't know if this might be of some help, but this is what I did to watch the movie on a Windows 7 computer.

1) Mount the ISO-file with the freeware Daemon Tools.
2) Open the mounted file and browse to the folder BDMV/STREAM.
In the STREAM folder there is a file called '00000.m2ts'. This is the movie.
3) Open the '00000.m2ts' file with the freeware VideoLan Media Player to play the movie.
4) Show english subtitles (the subtitles also covers the russian parts) in VideoLan with the menu 'Video/Subtitles Track/Track 2'

Thanks again HD-R-US!"
[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-29T08:42Z,"L_Hammond - Nicely put. Cheers, and you're welcome.

sky_24 - As stated above for VLC Media Player, but KMPlayer will not display PGS stream subtitles, so you will need the .srt format subtitles which can be downloaded from here:
http://www*divxsubtitles*net (replace stars with periods)
Search for ""HD-R-US"" and you find subtitles for all of our releases.

KMPlayer:
Right click the screen
Subtitle > Load Subtitle...
Browse to where the subtitle is on your computer, and click open."
,demon080291,2011-02-21T07:27Z,"Hey HD-R-US, ur uploads are super! Quality is #1 for a 4.36GB file. I still have a little problem: I stream the movies on VCL Player and turn on the English subtitles, but they just flash on and off for 0.1s => can't read :(
Is it my computer's problem or I don't do it right? (I do exactly what L_Hammond writes..)
I also try to add subtitle externally, and my VCL Player stops playing. Any suggestion will be appreciated :)"
,foxelein,2011-02-23T17:45Z,"really'.. the way of ""streaming"" are very useful..
thank you again mate.. :)"
,Malasky,2011-04-04T11:24Z,"Would just like to thank you for this upload. Sound and vision quality are both excellent. Really faultless for the size of the file.
Cannot thank you enough. 
Plays brilliantly on 32"" LCD TV. 
Instructions to burn to disc using Imgburn are a nice touch too!
Thanks again. Keep up the good work. It really is appreciated.
Will seed for a 1:1 ratio at very least."
,v1rto,2011-05-05T02:16Z,"would be good if you include a ~50mb sample outside the iso, for example i dont know what your releases look like and i have to download 4gb to see.. too bad"
