[V],neon,2010-11-25T09:17Z,What ?
,zato1,2010-11-26T02:12Z,"Thanks neonrainbow, I saw this in the theater when I was 14."
,greenteagod,2010-11-26T06:19Z,Fucking HDnet bug embedded throughout the entire thing.
,buzzmeupplz,2010-11-27T11:24Z,"if it wasnt for the hdnet at the bottom, i would have kept this dl"
,TPB_helper,2010-11-30T06:50Z,Thanks now i will know what Tron Legacy is all about and if it will be a waste of money :)
,QuicSilver,2010-12-06T06:42Z,"To the idiots that don't do their research....Tron has not been released in an HD format, so the HDNet at the bottom is simply a TV rip of the movie upconverted. It's definitely better than the DVD options and it's not one you'd keep in your library. They WILL release the movie in HD, but in order to see it in a higher quality before the Tron Legacy is released, this is one of the better options.

Stop whining and criticizing what you don't understand. F'in internet tards...the world is doomed."
,x4skill,2010-12-09T16:27Z,"Thank you!  The HDNet logo is not very distracting, only half of it's visible in the very bottom righthand corner.

For some reason though, the movie wouldn't play past around 1 hour 14 minutes when playing from a flashdrive on the USB of my TV."
,Philonetic,2010-12-14T22:23Z,"neonrainbow, you're quickly becoming my favorite uploader.  i do 2tb a month so that's saying alot o.o"
,YanCouto,2010-12-29T14:14Z,"Hey, Thanks for the movie! But I have a problem, The movie won't play past 1:28:24!! I tried a different video player but it won't work! I wanna see the end :((("
,artofwar7,2011-01-07T03:23Z,Does this thing play all the way til the end or not????
,Ratmanslim,2011-01-19T16:47Z,"It's really amazing work you've done here.

It's impossible to buy Tron, the price on E-bay is around $50 (used) and here it is on Blu-Ray!! How did you get this one on Blu Ray?"
,Enverex,2011-03-16T18:29Z,"He didn't get it on BluRay, hence the title ""HDTV""."
,chicken_nipples,2011-05-15T10:32Z,does this play to the end?
