,aaroninfidel,2011-01-16T05:54Z,anyone know how to get the bridge working on this thing?
,spam0000,2011-01-19T21:20Z,"@ ymail92:
you dont have to download everything in the torrent. Open it in your torrent app and select or deselect the files you want or dont want. This should also be a revelation for you to understand that you can for ex. get a torrent of a whole discography and only download one album. You're welcome ;)"
,thefirmm111,2011-01-21T07:43Z,"I downloaded this and opened ableton and everything seems to be working fine, except for there are no drums! And when I download drum kits and vsts (even free ones) they wont open and says ""media files are missing"". Is this not a full working version on ableton? or did I do something wrong? Can someone please respond to this"
,nthorne,2011-01-30T05:21Z,"the auz file is not available to select from the torrent client. 
Please could someone upload it and link"
,8ttavious,2011-02-12T06:34Z,Could someone please just post the auth file?  What is the point of posting the entire iso when it can be downloaded from the official site?
,Bundeshase,2011-02-12T13:13Z,"Thanks a ton guys.

But it seems that this version has some bugs? For example, the scrub tool doesn't seem to work when warp mode isn't activated?

Help would be greatly appreciated!"
,timrie,2011-02-22T07:42Z,yay it worked. very simple. thank you

,KnotsD,2011-04-05T14:28Z,"For every torrent i have tried, it all seems fine until i install the Ableton with content dmg. At this point there is a white prohibitory sign over the ableton icon. When i try to open the auth file it says that it is not supported on this system. I haven't had a Mac for very long, can anyone help?"
,ohitexplodes,2011-04-07T03:39Z,"thefirmm111...
I'm getting ""media files are missing"" too. Can't use the drums or presets, and I had a working version of 8.1 installed with that content all working. Wondering if it's because I opened the authroize81mac during the installation.... Did you open it before you installed or when the authorizing prompt came up?

Weak."

,ninesevenfive,2011-07-20T08:07Z,Does this version work with OS X Lion 10.7?
,IcaBobCrain,2011-07-23T05:38Z,"There are 41 “arc-suite821osx” rar files in this folder with NO instructions. Is there a good reason for all the rar files? After you open a rar file, there is a “program only” and “with content.” 

Neither works with Snow Leopard. You just get ""Live unexpectedly quit."""
,dandeedan,2011-08-03T11:25Z,"no shit some people are clueless, They keep downloading the trial and then try to use a crack on it! NOOO, You HAVE to dwnload the cracked versions in my experience from what (other ppl) tell me=) Hope this helps all the nay sayers and idiots who shouldnt even have the powers of a daw on their comp."

,koopa_troopa,2011-08-11T03:00Z,"fuckin A. not only did i not have any problems (did as stated in Daveparty comment) it transferred everything from Live lite 7. Cheers, champ."
,phailurex,2011-09-11T20:11Z,"At first after installing the dmg and then patching trying to open the .auz file would result in the icon jumping in the doc forever.
What I did to fix this issue:
After installing the .dmg file and copying over the new ""Live"" file into the Contents/MacOS folder...
1) Open terminal (click on the magnifying glass in the top right and type terminal, then open that application)
2) Type: ""cd .."" without the quotes into the terminal and hit enter
3) Type: ""pwd"" without the quotes into the terminal window and hit enter. If it displays // continue to step 4. If not, repeat step 2 again until ""pwd"" does (you will have to retype pwd each time after you do step 2).
4) Type: ""cd ""Applications/Live 8.1 OS X/Live.app/Contents/MacOS"""" without the outer set of quotes, but with the inner set of quotes and hit enter
5) Type ""chmod 755 Live""

This tells your computer that the file you copied into the folder can be executed."

it's a much smaller file. How come?"
,Samosith,2012-01-04T16:47Z,The DMG with content wont open. 
,WhyPaywhenUcanPirateBay,2012-02-19T01:39Z,@SVDZ that's because its a program only. 
,diablo9333,2012-03-11T18:10Z,"I don't even get a DMG. I get an ISO and then when I try to open it I get an error saying ""no mountable file systems"". I looked online for people with the same issue and none of the solutions fixed this. This file must be corrupt unfortunately. Either that or something fishy is going on. "
