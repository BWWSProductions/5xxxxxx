
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Compiler (1998) Standard Edition.

The legendary C++ compiler... Still produces C, C++, and Windows applications
that are leaner and faster than anything that the .NET compilers can produce today.

-Produses dsp/dsw projects.
-Excellent for learning, it will not distract you w/  today's busy Visual Studio displays.
-No signatures, if you write a naughty program (but not guarranteed w/ updates).
-Well behaving, it will not interfere w/ your fancy-schmancy 2008 or '10 compiler.

I uploaded it in the past with the MSDN disks. The disks would increase the size from
the current 83MB to over 1.1GB. I guess you can connect to the MSDN Site instead.

Instructions:

1. Unzip to decompress the compiler.

2. Open the text file 'Serial' inside the compiler. Leave it open.

3. Run the Setup.exe (the multi-colored sideways '8'). Vista,7, run as Administrator.

4. During installation it will ask you two important questions (besides the usual ones):

   1-INSTALLATION: TYPICAL OR CUSTOM. Choose 'CUSTOM'.
     On the panel that opens next choose 'SELECT ALL' and 'CONTINUE'.

   2-REGISTER ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES: Check the square next to it and OK.

5. After it is done with the installation, it will ask you for the MSDN Library.
  Check the "do not install msdn". It will complain, but continue.

6. At the very end asks you to register with Microsoft. Do not (uncheck the square).
