Love the songs but...
Got them downloaded in 'Incomplete Downloads' folder with 'FLAC file' extension.
What is this?
How I can make this work?   "
[V],dickspic,2010-11-25T20:44Z,"first if they are incomplete download them again.
then if you are using a mp3 player convert to mp3.
or use a player such as AIMP2 to listen to flac files"
