,Final_Justice,2010-11-25T22:29Z,Love all of the ups!!! But what is up with the damn MKV crap??? WHy not just mp4?  Converting each of these files is a bitch to fit on my psp 3000.
[T],on.off.on,2010-11-25T22:44Z,@Final_Justice MKV???? its m4v files.. the same as mp4 ;-)
,defeatedsanity,2010-11-26T09:38Z,"Hi TDW, Good to see ya back! "
,Final_Justice,2010-11-27T02:59Z,.m4v is .mp4 files with the WRONG extension introduced by Apple for video+audio. A person who wants t play it on PSP or anything has to get conversion software.
,defeatedsanity,2010-11-27T06:49Z,@Final_Justice: .m4v works perfectly fine on my psp and ps3. There is NO need for any kind of conversion what so ever. Do you have the latest psp firmware? Can't understand why you are having trouble and need to even use conversion software for something that works perfectly fine on most all handheld devices.  
[T],qwersd,2010-11-27T07:54Z,"thanxxx....
already had the season 1 from TDW, so i got the other three seasons..
@Final_Justice try installing a recent firmware on ur PSP, i think it should work natively then...
my psp plays almost all m4v's perfectly..."
[T],qwersd,2010-11-27T07:56Z,"thanxxx...

@Final_Justice my psp plays almost all m4v's perfectly, try upgrading to a recent firmware..."
[T],on.off.on,2010-11-27T10:08Z,@Final_Justice but why did u say MKV??? this is not crap.. it works on ur psp ur just doing it wrong ;-)
