,m00niac,2010-11-28T20:43Z,"thanks for reply.
tried that and still no luck tried in vista mode too, must be something up with my directx.
gets right up past the loading screen and then drops to black screen with the error.

,AlexGivens,2010-12-01T18:04Z,"The guy above lies undoubtedly.  The Skidrow crack doesn't work.  I too get the directx error.  Seeing that this game is not very popular with the masses, I doubt SR will fix it.  

Reloaded would have done it already."
[T],rlf-rls,2010-12-01T19:48Z,"AlexGivens SKiDROW crack work, if u have errors check your system and most important... if this release doesn't work why scene can't see it? No nuke on this.  "
,AlexGivens,2010-12-02T06:40Z,"No, it does not work, and my system is fine.  I have no problems with any other games.  Been working with computers since the 1980s.  It's a bad crack, period.  Even the developers of the game have said as much.

I've seen others complain also of the same problem.  Since it's not that popular of a game for most, you're not going to hear a lot of chatter."
[T],rlf-rls,2010-12-02T11:47Z,"Lol i do this since 199x :) and when i say ""it's wok"" it's work!!! Check this out .. this is screen shots from my computer:

SKiDROW crack work perfect for people who knows how to use Windows

"
,forreal435,2010-12-02T18:24Z,This does not work at all .....and i know how to crack it and use windows... im not new to this...its up to you guys if you download this.. im just letting you know its not worth it.... :)
,Marcelus99,2010-12-03T05:59Z,"I get the directx error too. The demo works fine for me. I used the .exe file from the demo to replace the one provided in this torrent, and I now can play all the scenarios..."
,AlexGivens,2010-12-03T06:27Z,"rlf, posting a screen-shot means nothing.  You could have gotten that anywhere or have the purchased game or know someone who does.

We have two more people here who say the same thing about the directx problem, plus the game developers themselves, who claim the error is coming from the crack version of the game.  

The demo also works fine.  It's not a machine problem: it's the SKR crack.  

Okay, like, I've been around computers since DOS 1.0 I know how to use Windows.  You, however-- for whatever reason-- are pretending as if the SKR game works when you know darn well it doesn't.  

It's only because this particular game is not as popular as Black Ops that SKR is not doing something about it.  

And if you like AGEOD games, then you'll love RuS.
"
[T],rlf-rls,2010-12-03T15:07Z,AlexGivens I don't understand you... u think that if the game doesn't work for you so it doesn't work at all. YOU WRONG !!! And thats it.   
,corvum,2010-12-04T17:12Z,"Oh c'mon... Why are you still continuing with your bs comments about this working.. It isn't. There is even a thread about the failed crack in the games forum
http://www.ageod-forum.com/showthread.php?t=19449
Downloaded it today and no matter what comptability or w/e it just crashes"
,AlexGivens,2010-12-05T01:36Z,"Yeah, it's weird how the guy continues with this.  But as someone above said, use the demo executable with the SKR release and the thing works, as far as I can tell, with all the scenarios."
,kerai,2010-12-28T01:48Z,"Most important: WRITE ANY CD KEY in AGESettings, then all works."
,rightjack,2010-12-29T21:06Z,"After following the install notes the game crashed after startup with ""directx error burst mode"". XP mode doesn't help nor does changing the CD key in AGESettings. Putting the .exe file from the Demo does at least start the game but most scenarios are unplayable as turn button is frozen, the Grand Campaign is playable up to the 14th when it freezes. The instructions doesn't work so the SKiDROW crack is obviously faulty."
,rightjack,2011-02-07T18:55Z,Does anyone have any solutions?
,quasius,2011-02-22T21:36Z,"Don't get me wrong the Skidrow crack is faulty, but I got it working. I don't know why it's working for me but it is. I followed the Skidrow instructions, and had the same problem as the rest of you. What I did was this: I changed ownership of the Revolution Under Siege directory to my profile name (if you don't know how to do this look it up), entered gibberish fore a serial number (like Skidrow said to.) I then ran Rus.exe as administrator and set compatibility to win XP SP 3. This time when I launched the game it worked. I hope this helps some of you...."
,quasius,2011-02-22T21:40Z,"Oh and keep in mind that I don't know WHY it works for me. I don't think you guys are doing anything wrong, I couldn't get it to work either and then it did for some reason."
,gurthaur,2011-03-31T21:39Z,"It works fine for me, but there is no crack for newer versions and this version is a bit plain."
,Sogamg,2011-04-11T17:13Z,It is not working whatever I try to do.I think the crack has problem.If someone could crack the 1.02a patched version of the game it would be great.Until then it is simply unplayable.I am usin winXP and I haven't found any solution yet about the CTD prob.
,vlcz,2011-05-20T17:05Z,"definitely works, you have to run AGESettings (provided in crack folder) with admin privileges, set over there a serial (any invented) and run RUS (included in folder) in XP comp mode and with admin privileges"
