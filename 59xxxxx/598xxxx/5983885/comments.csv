Can anyone help me please?"

However I do have to say DONT download this release. Yes it is FFX international however once Tidus and Auron meet up in the beginning of the game the audio (music AND fx) become distorted, they did not patch this game correctly. Might have the most seeds but this does not go well on PCSX2 with ANY plugin, tested on 3 computers. It is the release that has a problem, hands down."
