Do you think you can upload Tottenham vs. Werder Bremen?"
,vincentdesrd,2010-11-26T02:04Z,"Forget my last comment. I posted it before watching. I just couldn't find highlights anywhere and being in Canada I have to pay ridiculous $$$ to get soccer channels and the EUFA is also charging money to watch highlights so... 

25$/month for one football/rugby channel(Setanta) and it's not even in HD, how crazy is that!"
