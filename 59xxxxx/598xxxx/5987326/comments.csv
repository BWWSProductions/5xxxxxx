,volnaib,2010-12-01T08:07Z,"Well, I have some LS's like X-Men: The End (2, maybe 3 books), X-Infernus, The Times and Life of Lucas Bishop, etc, and some issues of Uncanny X-Men and X-Men: Legacy and some other comics, almost all related to X-Universe. I'll post them then =)"

,volnaib,2012-03-29T07:43Z,"@Korbl Sorry, haven't checked the comments for ages. I think I've managed to alter some files in the folder (e.g. switched *.cbr to *.rar). I'll check it today, guess I'll have to re-upload this torrent."
