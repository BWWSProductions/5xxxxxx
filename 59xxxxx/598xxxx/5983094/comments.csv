,ricky21121,2010-12-07T20:38Z,"Probably the best Mugen on here. Like the second screenpack better than the first. The characters included are pretty good. And the MOTVN stages and music are awesome!

@lukegoodman2001, some HR characters but no HD characters.

Some info for those who know about MUGEN.

-It's the RC8 build
-640x480 only on the 2nd ScreenPack

Anyways thanks for sharing lestard01"
