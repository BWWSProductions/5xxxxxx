Update File Works for me."
,NanoEntity,2010-11-24T12:24Z,"NOTE:
This update breaks mostly all mods, plus has tons of bugs in SMP and SP.

I suggest you wait for more stable version as NOTCH is updating it like every few hours, by tomorrow you might see v1.2.4 lol"
,narfdude,2010-11-24T12:43Z,"ok. thanks a ton, Nano. and thanks for your previous mc uploads. but you do know this is minecraft ""alpha"" right? there have always been bugs in this game."
,onyxlion,2010-11-24T15:02Z,"Please upload the new minecraft server files!

I run a hamochi server with friends and it always takes several days to find the newest server files when there is an update.

(i would just buy it if i could lol)"
,hugo123889345345,2010-11-24T15:17Z,"@onyxlion
You can download the Server File from the official homepage - Works fine."
,eXoflow,2010-11-24T15:32Z,Awesome thx :P
,onyxlion,2010-11-24T16:14Z,"wow i feel stupid now...

THNX for the awesome upload and the server file explain too!"
,Digital55,2010-11-24T18:31Z,"@narfdude,  Thanks again for your speedy update! I really appreciate you guys uploading this. 

@NanoEntity,  Thanks for you suggestion to wait on the next update. I believe your right. Thanks for your uploads too."
,NanoEntity,2010-11-24T21:30Z,"The thing is this breaks all server mods and updates.

Need to wait at least 1 week for the modders to catch up and fix all there mods for SMP

This is actually pretty big patch that adds HP support and PvP."
,bestu,2010-11-24T22:24Z,"hi guys i was wondering if one of you would be kind enough to tell me how to get started with minecraft.i heard of the game a long time ago but i wasnt curious so i didnt checked it,now i am and i wanted to start playing.i find out that there is a single player and multiplayer version of the game,is the single player one crackable ?"
,narfdude,2010-11-24T23:38Z,"Notch isnt going to update the game for maybe another week. It is safe to download this one and play it online if you dont play on a server that is modded. I've been playing for a few hours and its all good.

@nano You ask for DONATIONS in the mc description on your page. that is the reason you would troll and rate this down so much isnt it? that is bad form. I'm not trying to compete with you. you took more than a day to upload the newest ones, so I decided to help out.

Here is Nano's site for those of you that want to donate: http://nekio.com"
,NanoEntity,2010-11-25T01:50Z,"I didnt even rate it, some one is rating my down too"
,NanoEntity,2010-11-25T01:55Z,"Also i take long to post my because the mods are not complete with newest builds, they always need to be updated.

And that takes time, sure i could post a release but everything would be broken and not working lol

In my releases im trying to make it as simple as possible to run a secure offline mode server.

AKA cracked, of course you cant play on retail premium servers, duh.

Most people don't know what there doing though."
,narfdude,2010-11-25T02:42Z,@nano yeah i know what you mean. i'm happy as long as we're cool with each other.
,eXoflow,2010-11-25T18:52Z,"i clicked the + :D

I rly appreciate this :) New update available btw!

I think I will make an auto-updater for the cracked minecraft, just need someone who can provide me with the new versions..;)
keep em' coming"
,narfdude,2010-11-26T07:55Z,"thx, exoflow. any chance you could make a plugin updater too? "
,Cide111,2010-11-26T18:15Z,Ive downloaded minecraft before but I wanted an upgraded version so I downloaded this. But now the username and password are no longer already filled in and I dont know what they were. I tried redownloading but nothing works. Whats up?
,Cooler110033,2011-02-20T08:09Z,Worked for me; thanks a lot for posting this Narfdude
,MerkaatVT,2012-03-20T08:24Z,Is this game have a virus? I ask you all who downloaded this .
