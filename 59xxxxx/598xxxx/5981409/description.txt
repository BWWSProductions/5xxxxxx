Minecraft 1.2.3_01

There are 2 files in this. One is an update for 1.2.2 users and one is the full game.
You will only need to download one of them. I've included the name spoofing launcher in the update file.


To get minecraft to work in vista and 7 put these files and folders in \users\"username"\appdata\roaming\.minecraft

For xp put them in \documents and settings\username\application data\.minecraft

If I've forgotten anything, just ask in the comments.
