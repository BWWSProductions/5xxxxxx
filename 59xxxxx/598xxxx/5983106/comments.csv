,J_Mags,2010-12-14T11:35Z,"Just seconding the question TombRaider asked, does anyone have the CD from this concert to upload? Thanks in advance if you do."

Took me awhile to dl this, so I will be seeding even though my connection sucks..you're welcome.

Many Thanx to the uploader...if you cant find the CD why not just record with Polderbits or DVD Audio Extractor?"
