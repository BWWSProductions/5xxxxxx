FlightSoftâ€™s FLY TO AFRICA FSX is one of the newest FSX titles released for Microsoft Flight Simulator X.   This unique flightsim add-on will rock your world!  FlightSoft brings you some of Africaâ€™s most famous airliners on a voyage to many of the countries in this vast and gigantic continent.  AFRICA is unlike any other continent in this world.  The diversity of countries in the vast continent provide the PC Pilot with an amazing array of airports in which to practice all kinds of approach profiles.  FlightSoft brings you brilliantly crafted flight scenarios to all the famous airports in this continent.  Youâ€™ll fly to country after country filled with all sorts of visual approaches, VOR, circling maneuvers, sideslip approaches, crosswind landings, ILS/DME when theyâ€™re working, and approach profiles never before seen in conventional airport routes.

FLY TO AFRICA FSX is the most exciting new title to emerge from FlightSoftâ€™s formidable arsenal of flightsim add-ons for Microsoft Flight Simulator.   Just imagine flying low enough to see giraffe, lions and elephants on final approach to an airfield.  You have to have knuckles of steel to fly some of the approaches into these airfields.   Just brush up on your visual approach skills as youâ€™ll only find NDBs and VORs in some airports and your hand flying maneuvers on wide body jetliners will be put to the test.   Perhaps only Latin America provides challenges to match the complexity of the approach profiles found in Africaâ€™s numerous airports.
