Allmusic Review:
Merry Christmas was released in 1994, and 16 years later Mariah Carey delivers a sequel, appropriately titled Merry Christmas II You and also featuring the diva in a sexy little Santa suit. The similarities donâ€™t end there, either: Mariah revives her original seasonal tune â€œAll I Want for Christmas Is Youâ€ and often touches upon the classy, clean updated traditional vibe of her readings from the 1994 set. Underneath this surface, Merry Christmas II You has a different vibe than its predecessor, derived in large part from the numerous originals here. Five of the 12 full songs bear a Carey writing credit (including that revival of â€œAll I Want for Christmas Is Youâ€) and these new tunes sometimes give Merry Christmas II You a lively modern feel, particularly the jumping Jermaine Dupri/Bryan-Michael Cox co-written opener â€œOh Santa!â€ and the slow groove of â€œWhen Christmas Comes,â€ highlights that balance the too saccharine sentiment of â€œChristmas Time Is in the Air Againâ€ and â€œOne Child.â€ The range of these originals indicates the scope of the record as a whole, how it touches on a little of everything to please every kind of audience, mixing up â€œAuld Lang Syneâ€ and a medley of Vince Guaraldiâ€™s Charlie Brown Christmas with traditional religious carols and secular favorites like â€œHere Comes Santa Claus.â€ Apart from that pair of stiff originals, the whole thing is cheerful and engaging, a worthy sequel to its predecessor.
