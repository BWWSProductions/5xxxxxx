Info:Peter Tosh found international fame alongside Bob Marley 
as a member of The Wailers. As a solo artist he released several 
landmark reggae albums and even recorded with the Rolling Stones. 
But he was more than just a successful pop star: he was a revolutionary 
and a hero to many of Jamaica\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s poor. He spent his life as a strident campaigner 
for civil rights and for the legalisation of marijuana. He was more militant and 
politcal than his former band mate and his uncompromising arrogance often landed 
him in serious trouble. For that reason, as this documentary reveals, his life could be 
as brutal as the way it ended. Grammy award winning film-maker Don Letts explores his 
career.
