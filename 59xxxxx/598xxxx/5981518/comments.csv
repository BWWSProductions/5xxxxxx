,sepoliur,2010-12-04T16:37Z,Please WIISOS guys do not use WiiScrubber on files. In some cases the game doesn't work because of that. Thank you
,club1820,2010-12-10T17:55Z,"I'm a newbie to Wii bootlegs so be nice. :)

does the console need to be hacked or can I just dl and rip to dvd and then play? way back I hacked my playstation with a mod chip and used bootlegs that way. stopped gaming for awhile but now have kids and wii. So any help in this area would be appreciated. "
,skullos,2010-12-10T22:24Z,"@ club1820 You have to softmod your wii first. I recommend you follow the tutorial on wiihacks. com, it's the best and most secure site for hacking your wii."
,lkm020,2011-01-29T17:26Z,"Great torrent. Plays perfect from usb hard drive on softmodded Wii 4.3E.
The Wii was soft modded using the guide mentioned by skullos."
,heltonbillyw,2011-02-02T12:42Z,when i load the game it is in black and white any help?
,Izskapts,2011-02-05T18:27Z,Someone help? What am i supposed to do with all those files of the game?
,Izskapts,2011-02-05T18:28Z,Someone help? What am i supose to do with all those game files?
,SCBacon,2011-02-23T03:41Z,"I have attempted one extraction which failed(file corrupt), going to retry tomorrow.

@Izskapts They are all compressed files. The game iso has been compressed and split into those files. You need either, winrar or 7zip (both free) to decompress the iso. "
,SCBacon,2011-03-06T04:20Z,"I have tried multiple times but cannot extract this game. I have used Winrar and 7zip, on both XP pro and Se7en Ultimate. I even tried unraring in Linux(Ubuntu and kUbuntu), I cannot unrar this.

If anyone else from the 81 seeders has unrarred the game and has it working please comment and let us know."
,SCBacon,2011-03-12T02:41Z,"I have finally gotten this to extract :)

It works :) no problems staring it.

My Setup,
I converted it to a .wbfs file(using Wii Back Up Manager), placed it on a ntfs drive and used CFGLoader.

The Wii Back Up Manager shows this as a PAL version as stated :)"
,unknown2u,2011-08-12T18:52Z,hey any help on what im supposed to do with the files? thanks
,Bl4z3,2011-12-28T07:49Z,"@heltonbillyw

You have to set ""Force NTSC"" in the settings of your backup loader or usb loader.

Game works fine. nice upload."

,supbon817,2012-03-26T12:26Z,Works perfectly! I had to spend a while figuring out how to hack my wii and use wbfs manager. Then I had to go get a decent sized usb stick. Now I am VERY HAPPY and just danced to Billy Jean! THANK YOU!
