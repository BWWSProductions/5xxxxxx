the previous version. i have chattchitto's
previous 6700. do i need to uninstall it?

or can i update chattchitto's 6700 using
the update from slysoft's website without
uninstalling it?

FYI: on the slysoft update page, there
is this message:

I have windows 7 32 bit and with the last download you released previous to this one it said trial period had expired and every time I would try to install an old one that used to work from you it would say the same thing.  It says now that it's a trial version for this one and it will let me use it, it just won't save the settings."
,PI0XMATE,2010-11-26T07:11Z,"Man I have been getting your torrents for ages. ALWAYS clean and working, @catflap if your using chatts torrents TAKE OFF auto check for updates because it will use the internet, also just un-install it... only few extra minutes...

Note for newbies: if its NOT working then TRY to NOT reboot computer.. works for me everytime :) just close tray and register

Thanks again chitto"

There are some fixes you need to do then.
Please contact my E-Mail or Site to provide you with a possible solution."

,AeotheKaear,2010-12-03T07:43Z,"@ChattChitto I know in the past you have asked to be notified if someone has a problem/virus/whatever with one of your programs. I had previous installed your version of 6.7.0.0 and it worked like a charm.

Just tried to upgrade to this one, and the install works great (curiously, I now have a full 21 day trial period again) but when I try to apply the patch, my Sophos anti-virus immediately identifies it as Mal/FakeAV-BQ and quarantines it. There is no option to ""authorize"" and presume it is a benign program, only to clean it, which removes it. I can easily reinstall, but remain unable to patch it (on the plus side, I apparently have three weeks to figure this out).

Any suggestions, anyone else have the same experience? "
,Int_Auto,2010-12-04T13:16Z,"@AeotheKaear

You need to disable your antivirus temporarily while you patch it. It's picking it up as a false-positive and locking the file. If this starts happening more often, I would recommend switching to Avira AntiVir. It has an option to ignore any detected file either temporarily or forever."
[V],ChattChitto,2010-12-05T22:49Z,Yup!
,AeotheKaear,2010-12-07T10:24Z,"I do believe that it isn't actually anything malicious. Unfortunately, that still didn't work. Exiting out of Sophos, running the patch and then trying to run the main executable resulted in it doing... nothing. As if it were running in the background but not having any noticeable effect. Not able to get this one working no matter what I do, thus far.

Thanks, appreciate the help. I really do love this software."
,PirBay,2010-12-07T19:01Z,"This worked AOK. Windows 7 HD 64-bit.  Follow Directions, I did a uninstall before hand. "
,AeotheKaear,2010-12-08T02:48Z,"Incidentally, would upgrading from Vista to Windows 7 help fix my problem? I do have a valid CD sitting around that I haven't gotten around to using. Thanks!"
,elektronik_supersonik,2010-12-08T11:04Z,AeotheKaear: I don't think I've ever had this kind of problems with Microsoft Security Essentials.
,DJBaldguy,2010-12-09T06:18Z,"Hey ChattChitto,

Just Curious if you have had any luck with version 6.7.5.0, I don't really like using these from anyone else... Yours have always worked perfectly

Thanks "
[V],catflap,2010-12-11T17:36Z,"hey i'm back. my 3 week old
laptop had an unrecoverable crash
and i had to get a replacement laptop.

so i just want to say thanks to chattchitto,
and the others here who replied to me.

i just reinstalled this version - i followed
the directions to the letter - and it installed
correctly.

@people asking about 6.7.5.0: there are
a couple of versions here on pbay, but
according to the messages the given reg
is invalid. but just wait for chattchitto to
work his/her magic (if he/she decides to
make v6.7.5.0).

@chattchitto: thanks again for the great work."
