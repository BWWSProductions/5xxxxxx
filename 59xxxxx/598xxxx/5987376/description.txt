Detective Stabler goes to his daughter Kathleen's university to discuss rape prevention at a Take Back the Night rally. When a girl from the crowd accuses another student of rape, Stabler and Detective Benson are assigned the case. What emerges are conflicting accounts and fiery accusations without substantial evidence to back them up. To complicate matters further, ADA Paxton returns to prosecute the case, and Kathleen oversteps her bounds, which could land her and her father in hot water.
