This one is soooooooo bad quality...but will watch it ...."
,D0gmeat,2010-11-25T01:33Z,"Eztv said the series was cancelled, they also said the remaining episodes will be aired in the US in January as filler for the post-holidays. Space Channel in Canada thank goodness saw fit not to have to wait."
,Vale40-6,2010-11-25T13:01Z,"Chillibean,
