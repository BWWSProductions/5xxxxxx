,emesma,2011-01-11T03:15Z,"Did work for me!!

I have a NTSC version with Wiikey2 and softmoded."
,pittbull42721,2011-01-18T00:32Z,i could not get to work with wbfs manager said some kind of error for the iso file
,ericxxxxx,2011-02-11T19:29Z,On my wii it works also with pall!!
,240p,2011-03-23T21:10Z,"for those who have trouble getting it on wfbs manager 3.0, stop seeding, add it, and then START SEEDING."
,crispykiller96,2011-04-01T02:17Z,Downloading now will seed after do i need some wii board to play this and can i just use the wii mote Thanks in advance :-)
,dbaillieuk,2011-05-01T10:20Z,"WBFS Manager coldn't read image file , thus didn't work for me . Any suggestions ?"
,malissav75,2011-05-08T18:52Z,"This is my first to download something for Wii. Can someone please explain the next step, what do I need to ut this on my Wii? Also I do know that you need a belt to wear, so how are you all getting around that?"
,lozza,2011-05-31T02:51Z,"i'm sorry but i fail to see why this has so many seeds. This game is utter bull, a retard could come first on this lol"
,steelbunny,2011-06-02T04:28Z,"ty 240p, stop seeding and add zumba.iso to WBFS, it works. Look like WBFS can load currently-being-used file."
,poppy20,2011-06-24T19:14Z,"lozza - I think you are the one that is a retard. The point of the game isn't to come first, it's a fitness game. 
It's like saying you can easily cheat while jogging by taking the car instead. That defeats the point."
,gurgel,2011-06-26T13:41Z,poppy20: +1
,Keithuk,2011-07-12T23:56Z,Why won't it load in WBFS Manager if its a iso? Any WBFS files you download you need Wii Game Manager to convert it to an iso
,BellasGoose,2011-07-25T11:55Z,"Hm, can anyone tell me why this game plays black and white and flickers on my screen? I've only just started downloading games for the wii so forgive me for being a dumb shit lol."
,muckymucks,2011-09-22T03:19Z,"Game works great. Convert the ISO to WBSF using Wii Backup Manager to trim it down. I have a Wii 4.3U using USB Loader GFX. Game works perfectly. Thanks for the upload, OP!"
,Keithuk,2011-11-23T02:59Z,"""Is this NTSC or PAL?""

Its NTSC and it works on my PAL machine."
,mummy.lowe,2012-01-04T21:38Z,"For all those not knowing having trouble with wfbs manager.

First download 'wii backup manager' (just google it).
Click 'add' and then 'transfer' to ISO.
Once you do that you can open the 'wfbs manager' as and add it on as normal."
,KiD_SwiFTzHD,2012-01-12T10:57Z,What region is it? Pal or NTSC?
,Osk8MC,2012-02-07T14:34Z,"amazing game. lost some pounds, which is great!"
,supbon817,2012-03-26T13:00Z,works PERFECTLY!! Thank you SO much gsps24892 You rule!!
