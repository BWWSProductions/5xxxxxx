v=10
a=10
format=3"
,gr459bq984,2010-11-26T12:57Z,What's wrong with the matroska container ? Every HD rip use it nowadays and it's supported by most media player.

I downloaded one 323MB version but could not watch it cause video quality for it was just awful.
I wish someone would make normal 350MB version from this file."
,gr459bq984,2010-11-26T14:14Z,@1mher3: It's in progress. I should post it in a few hours.
