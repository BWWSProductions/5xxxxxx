,dflu,2010-11-27T20:19Z,"It's not working on my iEdge, just get a gray screen. "
,kreem,2010-11-27T20:23Z,"Like a lot of the roms offered by simmyboy, this doesnt work - on the M3i Zero with the latest core/software its just a blank screen. On the R4i SDHC with latest software it runs, but combat is not working so it's unplayable. Guess it's another one for owners of original R4 cartridges only."
,bob1960,2010-11-29T17:34Z,seems two be working now on woods r4 1.18 lastest update..

Hello m8

You just need this new kernel (software) 
http://www.r4ds-r4i.com/pages/R4i-Gold-Kernel-Download.html

It's the newest one

1: First format your sdhc card (the little black one) 
2: Then put this kernel on it (the link i just say)
3:Then put any games on the card
4: Play and have fun for free

Cheers

,kreem,2010-12-12T16:07Z,Screw it. Whats the point - you've said in the past you need a genuine R4I Gold card (which I don't have) I don't really know why I bother because all nds games look and play like shit anyway..
,bpb235,2010-12-14T21:37Z,Works 100% on R4 with Woods 1.18 - Simmyboy80 is always best for NDS !
[T],simmyboy80,2010-12-15T20:02Z,"@kreem

im sorry my rom uploads dont work for you but if you are using a cloned r4 card you cannot expect much , there is a version of woods available i think its called WAIKO loader for R4 clones you can try that or buy an official flashcard"
,KNP1995,2010-12-19T03:18Z,this game doesn't work an a dsonei card. please help!
,ronniemeas,2011-01-01T04:16Z,Thanks! Works Perfectly on akaio
