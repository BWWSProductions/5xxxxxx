,NeaSaa.,2010-11-25T09:09Z,COULD YOU TELL US WHY YOU ARE LIEING?THIS IS VBR NOT 320kbps
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-11-25T09:11Z,"open folder > Select all > right click > properties - bitrate 320kbps.

Hence > AAC bitrate 320kbps.

I don't lie!"
,NeaSaa.,2010-11-25T09:26Z,funny LOL this is VBR people
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-11-25T10:27Z,Do what i said and you will see it is NOT - noob
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-11-25T11:46Z,"I can see why you think its VBR now lol. Because the other release, similar in size is listed as VBR. Maybe 'trfkad' converted the files from AAC to mp3? 

Whatever the case, this is AAC @ 320kbps. if you actually DOWNLOADED it then you would know, rather than 'presuming' I have lied!!!!

Please dont mislead people, thanks!"
,flugu,2010-11-25T14:08Z,"This is definitely VBR, ranging from 186kbps to 251kbps.  I have actually downloaded it so I'm not just presuming - if you right click on the individual tracks and look at the info it says it is VBR.  Either you are lying to us, or your system is lying to you.

Also, is the first track supposed to have audience clapping on it, and is Endlessly supposed to be so crackly?  They sound like live tracks."
,SoftWarez,2010-11-25T14:32Z,"VBR.

Never look BitRate from Properties. Download ""Mediainfo"" and look then. Its VBR."
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-11-25T14:51Z,"i certainly don't lie, chack all my other torrents, When I hover over the individual tracks it says the following: ie:

type: mp3 audio
bit rate: 320kbps
protected: no
size: 6.49MB               ?

right click>properties gives this:

bitrate: 320kbps
channels 2 (stereo)
audio sample rate: 44kHz     ?

I have listened to 'Endlessly', and you are correct, there is some sort of 'static' on there, but i don't know the song so i'm not sure if that's how its supposed to be.

This is where i acquired the album from... http://www.rlslog.net/duffy-endlessly-2010/ - and the details stated are the same. 

I'm gonna give people the benefit of the doubt and remove the 320kbps from the title of the torrent, but i'll leave the details inside the same, as thats whats stated in the p2p release info?!?"
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-11-25T15:04Z,"^^^ Downloaded 'mediainfo', and yes, you're right. Didn't know you had to do that, i've always just checked properties!

My source gave out the incorrect info and I thought it was correct.

Will do from now on and thanks for the information SoftWarez. And apologies to anyone who has downloaded thinking it was 320kbps - my bad!"

,kontvov,2010-12-16T20:18Z,"Thx Horrorspoke
Nice:-))"
,Blastcat2,2010-12-22T09:28Z,"OK, to settle this once and for all

this is vbr. If you have Winamp as a player, this is a non-issue. Also, the best tag renamer has to be
Tag&Rename, it does everything, gets tags from Amazon, tags, renames, and yes even tells you the exact bit rate. It resides in a context menu so that you can tag and rename any album.

Now, as to quality, this is perfect.
It does have accurate rip info in the tags that I took out, but that should not affect the perfect sound. And yes, Endlessly has an old time record sound. And yes, the first track has applause. The album producers wanted a ""retro"" feel to the album. Notice the cover. Its sixties, baby, oh YEAH !"
,mikedeboer,2011-01-28T15:10Z,I thank you for the great CD ;-) Let the people talk.... Ik's ok and in winamp it is a various bitrate scaled up to 320 so don't complain or buy the cd....
,daniru1993,2011-03-16T16:40Z,"would everyone shut the fuck up and just enjoy the music this person has uploaded for us....jesus
