Endlessly is the upcoming hily-anticipated 2nd studio album from Welsh singer songwriter Duffy. The album is to be released on 26 November 2010 in Germany in advance. Im honestly a fan of this singer. Her debut album is absolutely great and her live performance is outstanding too. Again, scene release is still not available yet. You can have an advanced listen first before I update the iTunes version for you tomorrow night

Endlessly is the second album from Welsh songstress Duffy, who shot to fame with her 2008 debut Rockferry. Duffy's sublime vocal talent shines through more than ever on Endlessly, which was co-written with Albert Hammond and recordedbetween London and New York. Single Well, Well, Well is atrack full of energy and attitude, with Duffy delivering catchy melodies with punch and confidence. A superb follow-up for one ofmost talented singers.
