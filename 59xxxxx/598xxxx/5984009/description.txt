Macrowikinomics: Rebooting Business and the World is the follow up to 2007 best selling business book Wikinomics. In Macrowikinomics, authors Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams take the principles of openness, collaboration, sharing, integrity and interdependence that they first outlined in Wikinomics and explain how these same concepts have a broader application than business practices and may be applied on a more global scale. Specifically, they consider government, financial service, automotive, healthcare, education and media industries.
