You can't get any other rips in this clarity with small size...
Of-course there are other rips but their size will be greater than 2GBs..."

Thanks for the rip..."
,skillet92,2010-11-26T07:42Z,dude the description tells 1280 x 544 but the screenshot is 1280 x 720?
[T],gunnersrock,2010-11-26T07:54Z,"@skillet92

i just maximize the movie on my monitor to take screenshots so every 720p movie screenshot will be 1280x720

,Tomek84a,2010-12-07T03:45Z,"I know such a categorization for feature films (which are usually 90-150 minutes): LowRes (300MB, usually RM), MidRes (700MB), HiRes (1.4-2.5 GB), DVDR (4.5GB), BDR (up to 25GB). Maybe on TPB ""Handheld"" is LowRes, ""Movies"" is ""MidRes"" and ""Movies HiRes"" is HiRes. I couldn't find any hints in forum FAQs."
