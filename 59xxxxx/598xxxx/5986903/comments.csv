,Vittorrio,2011-02-02T20:57Z,Comes up after about 15 mins that it is not authorised for this device (PS3) and mutes the sound. What a disappointment! 
,Vittorrio,2011-02-04T16:49Z,It seems this is a new DRM called Cinavia. Hope someone can find a work around soon. I have copied the HD file to dvd and will try it in the Xbox 360 tonight. Fingers crossed!

At the very least, there are two scenes in the beginning that would warranty this. If anyone has come across this, please comment."
