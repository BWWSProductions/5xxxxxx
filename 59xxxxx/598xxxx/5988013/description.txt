Chris Rea Blue Guitars Album 2(Country Blues)(mp3 320 kbs)ICM369
________________________________________________________________

Blue Guitars is a Blues album released by Chris Rea on October 14th 2005 
consisting of eleven CDs, one DVD and a full colour book, including paintings 
by the artist, liner notes and song lyrics. 

The album is an ambitious project with the 137 songs recorded over the course 
of 1 1/2 years with a work schedule - according to Chris Rea himself - of 
twelve hours a day, seven days a week.

The collection is the fifth and last release in a line of Blues recordings 
Chris Rea has made since recovering from a serious disease at the turn of the 
millennium and promising himself a return to his Bluesy roots in the event that 
he survived. 

According to Rea "Blue Guitars" will be his last solo effort; however, he will 
continue to release albums as a member of the band "Memphis Fireflies".

Albums

The eleven separate records which comprise "Blue Guitars" could as well stand on 
their own; in combination, however, they provide a journey through the different 
epochs of the Blues, showing the various components that have been added to the 
original African Blues over time, the changes in instrumentation, style, lyrical 
expression and thematic implications. 

Thereby Chris Rea and his band imitate the various styles and lyrical topics, 
creating an instantly recognisable atmosphere on each record, with the first few 
songs usually setting up the direction in which the record is going and then 
developing to various styles within the field of each record.

Album Number Two - Country Blues
________________________________

Country Blues was the natural development, the original Blues would go, once it 
had arrived in the American South: it was a dark time, a time of fear, people had 
to work hard during slavery, even harder after they had been released, wandering 
around unemployed, aimlessly. 

Racism and The KKK made the situation even worse, which reflected in the music, 
instrumentation gradually changed and the lyrics told stories of fear (KKK Blues), 
aimless wandering (Walkin' Country Blues), alcoholism (Too Much Drinkin'), but also 
the flight from prevailing conditions, maybe with another perspective for life and 
the future in the big cities (Ticket for Chicago). 

But also themes of movement (Steam Train Blues) and the faith in God and Religion 
(If You've Got A Friend In Jesus) were made topics in the songs, as well as the 
occasional search for some recreation and a good time (Dance All Night Long). 

The social and personal problems found their way into the music and started to 
change the Blues on a profound level.
