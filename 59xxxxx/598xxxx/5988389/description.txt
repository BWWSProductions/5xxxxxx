The Coon now leads an entire team of crimefighters, which includes Mysterion, Toolshed, Iron Maiden, Tupperware, Mosquito, Mintberry Crunch and Human Kite, although Cartman is intent on taking all the glory. A fire breaks out in a local apartment building, and Cartman gets his mother to drive them over. Before they can take any action, though, Captain Hindsight, a renowned hero, arrives at the burning hotel, to a standing ovation, although all he does is tell them of safety measures that should have been taken, and then leaves. People are thereafter all relieved and promptly abandon the burning building, leaving fourteen people remaining in the apartment to burn to death. In the aftermath, Cartman concludes that they will need to get Captain Hindsight to join them in order to regain what he believes to be their former glory.
