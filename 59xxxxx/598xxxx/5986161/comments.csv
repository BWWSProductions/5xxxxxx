,sugaaloop,2010-12-03T02:12Z,"I am having problems installing on windows 7. It seems that the download works, but this version was never supposed to work with 7 or vista. MaxiVista released a fix in version 4. Is anyone able to get this version to work on 7 or vista?"
,LordOrwell,2011-05-26T19:24Z,@sugaaloop Are you seriously trying to tell us a program with vista in the name isn't designed for vista?
,jimdil4st,2011-08-26T11:17Z,"@LordOrwell, You do realize that vista, by definition, means a pleasant view. Which makes perfect sense considering what this software does."
,legalbrr,2011-08-28T22:34Z,"Works perfectly for Windows XP, but NOT for Windows7.

As alternative, you can find (Google for it):
- Zone OS (http://www.zoneos.com/zonescreen.htm)

If you want the Remote Control feature, you can use Synergy or Synergy2 (http://synergy-foss.org/ or http://freshmeat.net/projects/synergy2/).

If your video card supports more than one monitor, activate it (even if you don't have another monitor), and install ""UltraVNC"" to share that additional monitor. That would extend your screen.

Anyway, thanks for this release (as it works greatly for WinXP), and we're waiting for the new MaxiVista (compatible with Win7) to be leaked."
,Berend.botje,2011-10-27T00:56Z,"Thnx Legalbrrrr for your excellent comment! 

And what a pitty for the fact that maxiviasta doesnt work with win7... Now we are indeed, waiting for the compatible version to be leaked into PB "
