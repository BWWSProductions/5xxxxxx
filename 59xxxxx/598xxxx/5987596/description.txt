Love Power Peace: Live at the Olympia, Paris 1971 is a live album by James Brown.
 
It is the only recording that documents one of his live performances with the 
original J.B.'s lineup featuring Bootsy and Catfish Collins. 

It was originally intended for a 1972 release as a vinyl triple album, but was 
cancelled after the key members of the original J.B.'s left Brown to join 
Parliament-Funkadelic. 

The album was finally released for the first time in 1992 as a single compact disc.
