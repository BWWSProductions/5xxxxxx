,DSIN,2010-11-26T11:00Z,"@prashant : this is a top quality rip that i can see.  but i think this movie would look great even on 750k bitrate.. as its only a drama ...with negligible action/ high bitrate scenes..
but i have no complaints as i always prefer quality over size ... ty "
,DSIN,2010-11-26T11:04Z,@mzk : size 'll approximately double :D

+1
surprise me by reveailing the list"
[V],prashant22,2010-11-26T12:14Z,"@ashu
i'll continue as planned
tomorrow easy A
then
the other guys
resident evil afterlife
then
step up 3d

@mkz
the more the bitrate the more the details...for same bitrate u can pack more details in 480p then in 720p...

@DSIN
ya right bt from now on i will be keeping the bitrate b/w 800 to 900kbps mostly 835kbps...as i want these rips to look better on a 26"" also...nothing to worry abt it will increase the size only by 60-80mb...

@prank
thanks nd welcome..

@himansu
welcome.."
,hello_rickoo,2010-11-26T13:47Z,Hey Prashant...your last upload salt was great with 5.1ch within 800 mb but this is only 2 ch..can't you make it 5.1ch no onwards.It's a great pleasure to watch it on your home theatre with 5.1 effect.that what i always look for.Please try.
,mrcool7,2010-11-26T14:33Z,"@prashanth22
no hurry yaar, upload rocky 4 when u r free...."
[V],prashant22,2010-11-26T15:12Z,"@hello_rickoo
i will upload some movies with 5.1 audio..like resident evil afterlife will be in 5.1..."
,muthineni,2010-11-26T17:10Z,"@prashanth..
good thinking buddy.. save the 5.1 for action and definitelyfor good visually appealing films..
very few people would want wallstreet in 5.1 :)
And im skipping this movie but screen shots r great.. i guess its the 900 rate showing in the snaps"
[T],MitZep,2010-11-26T17:49Z,wen yu gonna post your list???
[V],prashant22,2010-11-26T18:14Z,"so here's the final list:
-titanic
-8 mile
-back to future trio
-natural born killers
-a beautiful mind
-lord of war
-Princess Mononoke
-red cliff(480p)
-requiem of a dream
-the game
-the lookout
-the silence of lambs
-the fugitive
-total recall
-atonement
-the thin red line(480p)
-dil chahta hai
-Banlieu 13(480p)

i have included more than 15 movies i think abt 20....so this is the final list there will be no more addtions or deletion to this list

this list is totally based on the criterion i had set...there r many good movies which have been left out only due to the reason that for some there was non availability of source...some i hv watched already...
like the list given by 'akind' i hv seen all of them except titanic..
even beatiful mind bt that movie is so fucking awesome that i can see it twice so hv included it in the list...
sorry to those whose requests hv been missed out...bt this list is the best..."
,jarman007,2010-11-26T18:40Z,"great list

thanks for including my requests:8 mile and the silence of the lambs


thanks again for especially 8 MILE
"
[T],MitZep,2010-11-26T19:00Z,"hey yur list is great only thing a few have been done by other uploders like a beautiful mind, thin red line, requiem for a dream, silence of the lambs etc so it wud mean xtra work but nt so much gain as some will download yurs bt most hav already downloaded others copies which are also quite great in quality so rest is upto yu my friend..."
[V],prashant22,2010-11-26T19:21Z,"@all
plz i dont want any comments regarding already done thing...
i just know that requests were made to me i had to do the selection i have done it.."
,sadhu19,2010-11-26T19:25Z,"hey prashant, i have been following your torrents for a while and you have done awesome job... . 
i wanted to know how can i play your movie files on a dvd player without loosing it's quality. .can you suggest some video converter and format which can maintain the same quality. .. . . . "
,sadhu19,2010-11-26T19:26Z,thanx again
,DSIN,2010-11-26T19:27Z,"@prashant : thanx dude...u accepted 6 out of my 10 requests... 
besides those 6... i'll also be waiting for ...
red cliff - heard so much abt it... its divided in 2 parts... 5 hrs in total ;)
the game - i requested this from yify & he did that in dvdrip.. very good movie...:D
silence of lambs - though i hav seen all hannibal movies.. this one is a classic.. hopkins is too kool in this movie.. + i only hav this in dvdrip LOL
Lord of war : i dunno how i missed out this one...looks good :D"
,DSIN,2010-11-26T19:31Z,"@sandhu : it depends on ur dvd player... if it can play h264/x264 mp4 format... then there's no problem... but if the player is not compatible with mp4... 
try ""convertxtodvd"".. best software for this purpose ;)"
,himansu_007,2010-11-26T19:47Z,"I was expected
cindrella man
pride and prejudice
in the list ...any way thanks 4 thin red line.."
,apple016,2010-11-26T20:01Z,"very good dude wait for ur uploads.
thx in advance"
[V],prashant22,2010-11-27T02:52Z,"@sadhu
as DSIN said if ur player can play mp4 files directly then there is no problem...
convertxtodvd is the best bt still i dont think it will maintain the same quality as the resolution will be changes format will be changed from mp4 to avi...the o/p will be good bt with some loss in quality...

@himansu
i was going to include cindrella man bt didnt found any source.."
,jarman007,2010-11-27T03:03Z,"@DSIN 

woow !  6 requests accepted

congratulations

i regret requesting only 4 movies......but then he said 3 movies/ person"
[V],prashant22,2010-11-27T04:06Z,"@jarman
I hv just selected the good movies...
Bt it was cheating from the side of DSIN..bt then also u all will get to see good movies.."
,jarman007,2010-11-27T05:55Z,"whatever man

"
,DSIN,2010-11-27T08:20Z,^i must hav missed reading that 3 requests per person thingy (rolls eyes) :D
,DSIN,2010-11-27T08:32Z,"@jarman : btw u r being hypocritical ... as u requested 9 movies in total... 5 1st then 4 :P
then himansu requested 8 movies..
mitzep- 8 movies
& akinday...- 8 movies..
so don't point at me only cuz i asked for better movies which are not available in small size brrips :D"
,jarman007,2010-11-27T09:41Z,"what ......

i said ignore my requests in earlier post

no one said you asked for bad movies .....i also wanted some of your requests (maybe not but others wanted..so its ok)


atleast my requests were box office hits.....people went to see them in theatres"
,DSIN,2010-11-27T11:24Z,"@jarman : prashant did include 2 of ur requests... so just chill & prepare ur REQUEST list for next time... 
& if u don't want to see my requested movies... i don't care... its totally ur loss ..  i won't request same old popular movies ... just cuz i want someone to do ""my named"" movies.. i was not able to find good brrips of those movies so i requested.. & each & every1 of those r very underrated classics.. 3 in top#250 list of imdb, 2 oscar winners, & all others r golden globe nominees or many award winners... :-P 
& for the ur comment on ""ur movies being box office hits"" ... LOL does that makes a movie any good...?"
,himansu_007,2010-11-27T12:18Z,"Dont fight brothers
me also neglected..."
,jarman007,2010-11-27T12:34Z,"@dsin
i didn't like your list ..........can happen with anyone

fight over



and about box office hits .........i like to watch movies in which people can money to watch it in theatre ...must be something good on it...............i would take the word of public over critics anyday

your movies are underrated for a reason......they suck......i will still watch them....maybe i will be wrong

i would want to be wrong because prashant will spend so much time on them"
[V],prashant22,2010-11-27T13:09Z,"@all
i already said i will select movies that seems good to me...its not abt someone being neglected or accepted...the truth is i cannot upload each and everything u guys request...
so dont fight...
look at sid and apple016 they didnt even got the chance to request..bt apple016 is happy with the list and i m sure sid will be too...
if some of u r nt happy i cannot do anything abt that i cannot make everyone happy..plz dont show ur frustration in ur comments..."
,DSIN,2010-11-27T13:22Z,"@jarman : nice way to end this so called ""fight""... telling me that my requested movies suck.. LOL
just becuz ur movie taste is same as of a 10 yr old kid doesn't mean that the movies u don't get through ur head ..suck..
& u r talking abt public opinions ?? LOL... the movies i named r all accepted as classics by masses...  whereas talking abt ur requested movies..silence of lambs & 300 r very popular titles... thats y noone named them :P
8 mile ... sucks ... eminem's story... LOL :P
2012 : the most sucking movie of the list... i hav seen better B grade movies(under 6 star imdb rating proves my point) :P
Now we can call it Quits :D
Peace :D"
,jarman007,2010-11-27T13:27Z,ok
