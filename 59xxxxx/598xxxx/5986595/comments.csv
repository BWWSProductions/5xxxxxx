,johnnydavidson,2010-11-27T06:50Z,gunnersock how come your torrents are so small? I'm downloading your Ed Wood one and I decided I'd comment on your newest upload to ask you. I just can't imagine a 500mb rip of a 2 hour movie being good quality let alone 720p. Please respond.

I will upload it when it's blu ray is out

@johnnydavidson

Trust me the quality is good, besides slow paced movies don't require high bitrate so the size will be smaller than action movies which require higher bitrate and will be a bit more larger in size

Check out these uploaders they too upload high quality movies in small size

[V],wushdishmeen,2011-08-08T03:04Z,"No offense but if the screenshots are what it actually looks like then you messed up big time.  Not only is it blurry for a bluray rip but the image is not the proper aspect ratio.   The image is stretched height-wise which is because of the fact that it's 1280 x 528 instead of 1280 x 720.

You cropped it wrong."
