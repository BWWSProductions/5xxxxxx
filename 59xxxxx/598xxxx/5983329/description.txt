Ubuntu 10.04 with Diaspora app. built using VMWare Fusion. Username: diaspora Password: !password1

Also installed, openssh server (change the password or all your app belong to us).

Diaspora is in "pristine" condition and hasn't been logged into, you may need to run rake db:migrate from the app directory, I forgot to check. 

To operate, double-click the diaspora icon on the desktop. A terminal will pop up, if you want to run as a pod, follow the instructions in the terminal. The homepage of Firefox is set to the application.

I'll seed at least through the weekend.
