The source was an excellent quality MPEG-2 file found on here.

I did nothing to the file besides encode to MPEG-4 AVC x.264 to dramatically lower the file size, but keep the same great quality intact.

Video = 29.97 fps MPEG-4 AVC x.264 NTSC 1920x1080p

Audio = 384 kbps .ac3 @ 48 KHz

High quality multiple image screen shot -
