Ian Lungold - Secrets of the Mayan Calendar Unveiled
(run time: 5 hours, 30 minutes - no copyright)

Ian Xel Lungold presents his and Swedish biochemist 
Carl Calleman's (calleman.com) findings about the Mayan Calendar.

September 6, 2003. Okanagan University College, Vernon, Canada.

For 525 years, adventurers and archeologists have studied the 
Mayan civilization for clues about their calendar system. Due 
to the translation of Mayan writing, discoveries of calendar 
inscriptions at Mayan ruins and the availability of scientific 
facts about Earth history, we now have the answer to the Mayan 
calendar mystery. 

Ian Xel Lungold presents scientific evidence that demonstrates 
that the Maya centered their civilization around the actual 
schedule of the evolution of consciousness and the unfolding of 
creation, galaxies, life and history, in a system of repeating, 
ever accelerating cycles. Now we have the pattern of all creation 
and it's called the Mayan Calendar.
