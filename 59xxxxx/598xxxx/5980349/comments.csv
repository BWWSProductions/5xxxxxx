,KiraValentine32,2010-12-01T12:48Z,"@Slickinator

pls avoid using this kind of setup it really sickening. extract then extract is messing up my system with unnecessary files thus it detects all your files as virus(false positive?). with this method you will just kill my SSD(main drive) including other SSD users

I downloaded from the other trusted user which gives me a clean and exact AVG installer with serial key.  this one is much better."
,KiraValentine32,2010-12-01T13:01Z,"my bad, i mean that one is much better.

having 3x extracting is taking too much time and data storage space. "

,NotWhoYouThink_Ergo,2011-01-22T19:01Z,I'm not trying to be a smart ass by asking this question. I scanned this with my free version of AVG 2011 and it detected 3 trojans. Did anyone else run into this?
,shilalydawg2,2011-01-30T17:53Z,"@NotWhoYouThink_Ergo

AVG picks up all keygens or cracks as hacktools. If you scan this with AVG, you're more than likely going to get false positives. If you are uncomfortable continuing, just don't torrent anymore. Otherwise, trust the uploader. That's all you can do.

Nice torrent, Slick. Two thumbs up."
,Firebird284,2011-03-01T04:36Z,Works Great. Thanks
,plipie,2011-04-10T17:41Z,"This is the first out of many that has worked for me, maybe because i can only use 64-bit versions. Either way its worked for me, Thank you! (awsome song btw)"
[V],Slickinator,2011-04-24T14:31Z,"thanx all i try and make these fun with diff songs once in a while ,i think might as well have fun as i setup torrents .....and yes its false positives with the AV's just disable temporarly"
,blazin109,2011-05-16T11:00Z,"DO NOT USE THIS!

Because:

Once you install this, you cannot uninstall it.
It doesn't work properly, there is a yellow exclamation point on the system tray icon.
Besides, you do not need antivirus programs if you use your pc carefully and responsibly..thank you, that is all."
[V],Slickinator,2011-07-23T15:34Z,it worked before fine for me no yellow exclaimation ...........and u can always google for a AVG remover removal tool as AVG is a crap prog for removing on previous versions
