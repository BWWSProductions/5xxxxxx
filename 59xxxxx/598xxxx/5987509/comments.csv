[V],SciFi-Sumo,2010-11-30T04:52Z,Thanks ever so much. I can not wait for E18. What a great show. FOX lost out big time by ending this great show!
,gr459bq984,2010-11-30T20:43Z,"Surprisingly, it wasn't FOX this time. Caprica is a SyFy show, they are the ones who cancelled it."
,BoonesFerry,2010-12-08T08:59Z,"Syfy revealed they’ve ordered a prequel pilot called Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome, which will replace Caprica next season if it gets picked up.
