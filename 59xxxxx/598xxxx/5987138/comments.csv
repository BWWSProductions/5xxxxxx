,davidm1963,2011-06-04T10:22Z,I can't access any of the seeders or leechers even after signing in to Pirate Bay. I don't have a firewall blocking access either. What's going on?
,dukeford57,2011-09-06T20:25Z,Some of the episodes are misnumbered. Some pixelation on some episodes as well. Still 8 out of 10 for this great series as far as video and audio quality.

Geez, hacklet - Thanks so much for taking the time to post the corrections. That was a fair amount of tedious work, and it is very sincerely appreciated. Wish everyone was as community-minded and thoughtful.

For anyone confused about the corrections: The files in the torrent are misnamed (easy to do).

 Hacklet posted the proper names to spare all of us the confusion of figuring out what's really what. 

In his/her post, hacklet first listed the name of the file as it appears in the torrent, then listed the actual name/number of the episode. 

So, before the ""->"" is the misnamed file as it appears in the torrent; after the ""->"" is the file's real title/episode information. 

Apart from the labeling issue and some minor pixelation issues, this appears to be a great, almost up-to-date complete series seed ('almost' because 2 very recently aired S4 eps were not available when it was put together).

Thanks a lot for the seed, tarapulka - much appreciated. 

Sincere thx also to hacklet and all s/l's. Will seed."
,redactedwv,2011-09-20T01:39Z,"One last thing: I checked addic7ed & s.scene. Seems there's no (eng) srt for the pilot or 1st ep, but the rest are out there on one or the other.

There are also Italian and Portuguese srt's about. I've not tried them, nor have i tried the eng - but the sources are generally solid."
