Ten-year-old Hannes, growing up with his young, single mother (Nora Tschirner) wants to join the coolest gang in the area, the Vorstadtkrokodile (â€œSuburban â€™Gatorsâ€). But the â€˜entry testâ€™ goes wrong and his life is saved by Kai, who is desperate to join too. But Kai is wheelchair bound and unable to even run away when things get hot. 

But when Kai witnesses a break-in, he suddenly becomes of great interest to the gang, being the only witness. He, in turn, will talk only if he can join. With his help and typically youthful imagination and courage, the group sets off to solve the case and take on the apparently unbeatable criminal gang.
