,dkhere,2010-11-26T16:05Z,Please compress the size to 700MB dude...
,subadra,2010-11-26T17:41Z,"thanks, one request if is possible? It's a Wonderful Life, Frank Capra, after all christmas time is coming, in dvdrip your Quality"
,kokobombon,2010-11-26T20:46Z,"Are you uploading in .mkv because your source is Blue Ray?
I hope youÂ´ll continue to upload in .avi your DVD rips :)"
,mma4me,2010-11-27T05:53Z,"Thanks FXG for the older classic movies in high quality.

BTW .mkv is a superior container to avi, so we all get a better quality movie at a smaller file size. And if you want a 700mb dvd rip try aXXo's rip it's still well seeded. "
,kokobombon,2010-11-27T16:56Z,"@mma4m3: I watch movies in my DVD player and it doesnÂ´t support .mkv :( 
anyone knows a good converter for OSX?
is aXXo back?! :O"
,PaulieD,2010-11-28T16:36Z,"Thanks a lot, looking forward to more BDrips from you!"
,Vid89,2010-11-28T17:17Z,Someone please tell us: is this the final cut?
,paragon9,2010-11-29T23:24Z,"prefer avi format if possible please.

the quality of your standard rips are superior anyway, thats why we don't need you to change format.

many thanks, from a grateful recipient..........."
,dreadpirateluffy,2010-11-30T09:46Z,"Always awesome work!
Not sure if you take any requests, but if you do, I've been looking for some old school, ""Navy Seals"" with Charlie Sheen - TIA"
,dude8888,2010-12-03T05:50Z,"Any thoughts on which version this is?
It says 1 hour 57 min long so it could be the ""Final Cut"" or the ""International Release""
(I prefer the Harrison Ford narrated versions)

I also prefer mp4 or avi over mkv format"
,Superaryan,2011-01-01T12:52Z,"this is good FXG, please try higher resolutions, like 720p once in a while."
,osriccc,2011-01-06T05:00Z,"Still waiting for a 1080p rip from PS3 team. ""Final Cut"" Bluray came out yesterday so I hope we find perfect rips of this PERFECT movie."
,supershorty13,2011-01-31T06:51Z,"For People complaining about this being .mkv
its a BRrip, not a Dvdrip, so its much better quality"
