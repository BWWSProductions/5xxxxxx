Does anybody know why is missing?"

check out the shows website and IMDB one more time before commenting!

http://www.the-pillars-of-the-earth.tv/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12&Itemid=20

it says format is 8x50mins...meaning 8 episodes, 50 mins each. 

IMDB says 8 episodes as well. Please know what you are talking about before commenting. "
