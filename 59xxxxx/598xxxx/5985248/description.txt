This is the time of year when friends and family gather 
round the television to exchange the traditional 
greeting -"Don't bother, there's nothing on".

Well this Christmas join Victoria Wood for her Mid 
Life Christmas featuring highlights from the Mid life 
Olympics 2009, with the most unlikely sporting events and 
a dance number that brings together the killer combo of midriff bulge.

Victoria then dons a bonnet and corset, for the popular costume 
drama Lark Pies to Cranchesterford, and revel in the further 
adventures of soap star Bo Beaumont played by long term 
collaborator Julie Walters.
