The Brooks family boarded The Neptune hoping for a relaxing family adventure. What they got was more than just an adventure, but a harrowing experience of disaster and close calls. They also got a motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perseverance to save her family when the perfect combination of storm, shoddy construction and bad judgement turns The Neptune into a ship-splitting disaster. What they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect was that would be what would bring them closer together than theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d ever thought possible.
