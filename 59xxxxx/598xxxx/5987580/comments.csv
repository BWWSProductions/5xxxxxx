,highstream,2010-11-27T04:09Z,"Many thanks!  Are you recording different this year than last.  I ask because these have played well in VLC on my computer, but not on a Stateside DVD player attached to a HDTV, where they show either a codec not supported or resolution not supported error.  I've been able to convert them to Xvid and Divx @ 720x480 and they convert to reduced screen size. To get them to full screen on the conversion, I've had to use WMV.  The downside of that is 3-4x the file size.  I seem to recall that this wasn't a problem last year, tho I watched most on my computer.  Thanks again,"
