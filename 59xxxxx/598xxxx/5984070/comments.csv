The director/primary photographer used a Sony EX3 camera with a Nikon 50mm manual lens shooting everyting on location in Mexico using only available light accept very simple LED-based lighting in some of the evening- and night shots. (The complete crew were comprised of just seven people, including the two actors and the director.)

Then the same guy made the CGI, compositing, color correction and what not - the complete post production packade - as well as the final editing in about 5 months using Adobe Premiere, After Effects.

The Blueray version of this movie won't have better quality that a:8/v:8 as it's just not there from the beginning.

And though - or maybe because - it's not a scripted film but ad-libbed just using a synopsis for the storyline and disregarding it's even slower than 'Everything is Illuminated', I must say that - if you're the type and have the patiente for it - it's an awesome movie to say the least. Absolutely one of the top flix in 2010 imo."
