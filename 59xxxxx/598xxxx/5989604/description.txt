     Releasenotes: Marking the 15th anniversary of the their debut album All
                   Change and a new UK tour by the newly-reformed classic
                   line-upcomes the deluxe edition of All Change. This superb
                   deluxe edition comes with a second CD, comprising the
                   groupÃ†s barnstorming live set from Leeds in 1996 plus a
                   selection of home demos made by the bandÃ†s lead vocalist and
                   guitarist, John Power.

                   John Leckie who produced All Change says, Ã´There are some
                   really great demos John did by himself in his bedroom. Songs
                   like "Fine Time" and "Back Of My Mind" have got that magical
                   quality The LaÃ†s demos had. They feel very precious.Ã¶

                   Released in 1995, All Change was to become the fastest-
                   selling debut in PolydorÃ†s history, outstripping The Who,
                   Jimi Hendrix and The Jam. The album sold over one million
                   copies and spawned four Top 20 singles: "Alright",
                   "Sandstorm", "Finetime" and "Walkaway". The stand-alone
                   single, "Flying", which reached Number 4 in the UK charts
                   also features on this deluxe edition both in the form of the
                   original studio recording as well as one of JohnÃ†s earlier
                   demos.  Cast aficionados will also be delighted by the
                   inclusion of the outtake, "All My Days", which has achieved
                   near-mythical status amongst fans.

                   Originally the bass player with Merseyside band, The LaÃ†s,
                   John Power started writing the material that would
                   eventually become songs for Cast in the early 1990s. On
                   leaving The LaÃ†s, he started putting together a group that
                   by 1994 would feature the classic line-up of: John Power
                   (guitar/vocals), Liam Ã¦SkinÃ† Tyson (lead guitar), Pete
                   Wilkinson (bass) and Keith OÃ†Neill (drums). The group split
                   in 2001 but in summer 2010 John Power announced that this
                   very same line-up are getting together again with plans to
                   work on new material and for a series of live UK dates.
