Iâ€™m stunttin, you can tell Iâ€™m stuttin
Push me, push back Iâ€™m on it
The 48 or 33, you see Iâ€™m all up on it
Love or War
Like a Marine, I'm about tours
This beat so sick, And I got cures
I run my bitch and how bout yours

INTRO

(Cide Twiy, a.k.a. Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh all day)

If Iâ€™m in it I be killing pussy
I stay still then she goâ€™n push me
Fuck all these bitches
They so freaky freaky
Barbie bitch like Nicki Nicki
See youâ€™s a fake ass bitch
You get me get me

Gotta her swallowing so much
You smell me coming
Like she shit me shit me
Hoe like Kimâ€™me
She begging for the camera
So I can shoot a flicky flicky
I call her honey bun
Her pussy taste sweet and sticky sticky sticky

But remember she a hoe
So she aint aint picky picky
So much dick been in her pants
She wearing Dicky Dickies

My dick so Ludacris
I got cunt in different cities cities
The irony, they all rocking the same line of Vickies Vickies
God I love them Vickies Vickies
Red and black
You wit me wit me?


CHORUS


But these bitches aint no Angels
Iâ€™m thinking more like Demons
Cause bitches steady scheming scheming
You think that Iâ€™ma wife you?
Bitch just keep on dreaming dreaming

Wake up!
And give salute to semen semen
I give em so much creaming
The bitches needing weaning 
Cum so hard got her pussy peeing
After her legs be shaking, 
and she be leaning leaning

Cause you hoes come a dime a dozen
Donâ€™t be mad, just honest not fronting
Now Iâ€™m with your girlfriend and stunttin 
Donâ€™t get mad your whole crew meant for smuttin
Dick forever young like Benjamin Button Button
Slave to my dick, think the shit was Southern
I fuck HEER sister and HEER mother
Maybe her auntie and her cousin 
Hoes fucking for dollas or nothing,
Cuase see it's nothing!


CHORUS


Hmmâ€¦
I paint you descriptionâ€¦
Of the type of woman Iâ€™m wishing
She a widow maker maker
She love my Tip so much you couldnâ€™t Taker
Cause she love my Trail of Paper Paper
Iâ€™m the Lion that steady raper
Guns drugs, she down for any caper caper
Do or Die, she ride
No, no, no, no  traitor
Cause that means I'ma see you later
Till I wife her
I think Iâ€™ma just date her
Might even eat her
If she willing cater
But know I love her as much has I hate her"
