"Le  miel coule putain, elle quitte son envoyÃ© le tout de l'homme. La mort  Ã©tait son nom, et le parfum qui se dessine. Elle pria pour la bataille,  et avec l'amour-je obligÃ© ses moyens gÃ©missements de douleur. Pour la  guerre, BÃ©lier trouve toujours plaisir, et pour plus de faim sans  mesure." - Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh (a.k.a. Cide Twiy)

"The  whore's honey pours, she leaves her sent on all of man. Death was her  name, and the perfume that looms. She begged for battle, and with love I  obliged her moaning pleas for pain. For in war, Aries always finds  pleasure, and hungers for more without measure." - Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh  (a.k.a. Cide Twiy)
