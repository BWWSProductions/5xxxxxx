This is an absolutely amazing film and one of my very favorites of all time!

One of the best performances in film! The rest of the cast is wickedly talented and outstanding as well; Hopkins, Ryder, Reeves and Sadie Frost. For Frostâ€™s first major film role she really made her presence known. And from the behind the scenes rare footage I have included in this release you can see what a deliberate and creative craft making a film like this was. A truly magnificent piece of pop-culture, and one of the great films of all time!

PLOT: Bram Stoker's Dracula is a 1992 American horror-romance thriller co-written, produced, and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, based on the novel Dracula by Bram Stoker. This version of Dracula is closely based on Bram Stoker's classic novel of the same name. A young lawyer (Jonathan Harker) is assigned to a gloomy village in the mists of Eastern Europe. He is captured and imprisoned by the undead vampire Dracula, who travels to London, inspired by a photograph of Harker's betrothed, Mina Murray. InDracula begins a reign of seduction and terror, draining the life from Mina's closest friend, Lucy Westenra. Lucy's friends gather together to try to drive Dracula away. 
It stars Gary Oldman as Count Dracula and Winona Ryder as Mina Harker, also featuring Anthony Hopkins as Professor Abraham Van Helsing, Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker, and Sadie Frost as Lucy Westenra in her first major film role. The film's score was composed by Wojciech Kilar and featured "Love Song for a Vampire" by Annie Lennox as the closing credits theme.

DESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVER OF DVD FOLDER:
Bram Stokerâ€™s Dracula follows the tortured journey of the devastatingly seductive Transylvanian Prince as he moves from Eastern Europe to Late 19th Century London, where after centuries alone in his crumbling castle; his taste for humanity has grown bold with desire. Touching that humanity, and having lost his own, this a chronicle of damnation and redemption, of horror and romantic passion, or renunciation and sacrifice.
Director Francis Ford Coppolaâ€™s vision of the story is highly stylized and yet remains uncommonly true to the source material. He has approached the frequently told narrative in a way that is truly unique. Emphasizing the human emotion behind the most terrifying aspects of the story and employing in-the-camera special effects in the manner used in 1900 by the early magicians of the cinema, Coppola has orchestrated a fresh and provocative presentation of a story which has seen numerous screen versions.

Dracula: The blood is the life... and it shall be mine.
Dracula: I am the monster that breathing men would kill. I am Dracula. 
Dracula: [about the wolves that are howling] Listen to them: the children of the night. What sweet music they make. 
Dracula: Absinthe is the aphrodisiac of the self. The green fairy who lives in the absinthe wants your soul. But you are safe with me. 
Van Helsing: We've all become God's madmen, all of us.
Van Helsing: She lives beyond the grace of God, a wanderer in the outer darkness. She is "vampyr", "nosferatu". These creatures do not die like the bee after the first sting, but instead grow strong and become immortal once infected by another nosferatu. So, my friends we fight not one beast but legions that go on age after age after age, feeding on the blood of the living. 
Mina Harker: Take me away from all this death!
