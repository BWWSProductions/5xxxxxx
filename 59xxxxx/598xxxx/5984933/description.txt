    Richard Miles explores the power and the paradox of the    
    'Greek Thing' - a blossoming in art, philosophy and       
    science that went hand in hand with political discord,   
    social injustice and endless war.                         
                                                               
    He paints a fascinating picture of the internal and       
    external pressures that fuelled this unique political    
    and social experiment, one that would pioneer many of     
    the political systems that we still live with today,       
    from oligarchy to tyranny, from totalitarianism to        
    democracy.
