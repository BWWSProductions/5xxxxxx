,vivatpb5776,2011-06-27T00:44Z,"Okay, as far as screen resolution goes, this .torrent has the largest by far (1280*528). However, the video quality is heavily pixelated. It is more noticeable during the night and water scenes. Also, for those that care, the uploader or someone else, took it upon himself or herself to brand the movie. In the lower right hand corner, there is a small (damn near unnoticeable but still there) branding of the word scOrp. Granted, this only stays on the screen for the first two minutes of the movie but it should not have been there in the first place.

I have another version to QC as well as two other versions being downloaded as I type this. Sorry but this version is not worth keeping, in my opinion."
