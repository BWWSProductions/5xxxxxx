,LCP-1,2010-11-26T14:11Z,"To user2598... not doing the Amazing Race China Rush, the show times are odd. You might wanna try some chinese torrent sites."
,LCP-1,2010-11-26T14:21Z,"Next week's episode will be a recap and highlights of this season's episodes, called Amazing Race Asia - Best Moments.

May be late in capping it, possibly may miss it also, hardware issues... :("
,user2598,2010-11-26T22:11Z,"Thanks for the China Rush info
Fingers crossed you cap the next episode as it looks like Brint has stopped capping TAR Asia
Thanks again"
