,SoftWarez,2010-11-24T20:40Z,And you still need to upload another SAME version of it? Lamer. Thanks for the comment tho'.
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-11-24T21:36Z,"Nope, Mine is actually an itunes release and is in AAC format, not mp3, totally different to yours! "
,SoftWarez,2010-11-25T07:06Z,"I have iTunes one too lmao. Your is 256kbps, which is not 320kbps, dumb. Mislabeler."
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-11-25T11:54Z,"That was a mistake, just checked and you're right it's 256kbps, admitted. It was listed as 320 where i downloaded it, and i didn't check it before i upped it. have changed the label.

Plus, you're has no details (i.e mp3 or AAC) so i didn't know it was itunes."

[V],Horrorspoke,2010-11-25T17:01Z,yeah i did.....

,g8aso,2010-12-06T00:52Z,"Good effort, BUT it isn't in ""PURE CD QUALITY EXPERIENCE!?!?!?!?!?"" as you claim.
Firstly: It's in MP3, so it will always be funamentally different, to be CD quality needs FLAC, APE or Wav.
Secondly: You have chosen the very worst of the 3 MP3 formats, Joint Stereo, that actually isn't even proper stereo at all. Joint Stereo shares certain bits between high frequency left and right channels, it is OK for low bitrates only and cuts high frequencies and stereo separation.
Even using ""Stereo"" is not that good, The only way to get the very best out of MP3 is to use Dual Channel, or Dual Stereo, then you DO get 2 separate left and right channels, and the best sound possible with an MP3.
