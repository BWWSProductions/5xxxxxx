,millennium5,2010-11-27T03:34Z,"The New World Order would like this to happen, all nuclear weapons under UN control. 

There is no way we can prevent anyone to build a nuke, anyone could do it, the centrifuges are just an obstacle anyone of us any day could circumvent. Therefor a nuclear weapon free world is impossible before the day Jesus comes back and saves all of us who want to be saved.

Sorry Bone but this topic is just to important for you to be the dictator of our opinions. Thanks for the up though."
,millennium5,2010-11-27T03:37Z,"@Yazzo, I fully agree with you, the filmmakers are either stoned or lusting for world domination, the latter is most likely the case."

You are a fucking maggot that probably sits in your mom and dad's basement whacking off and thinking your cool making such inept comments that you would never be able to back up in person. It is obvious that you would never be capable of standing up for a country or anything that would be commendable. We are absolutely amazed that you had the audacity to utter such evil crap. Your karma is fucked"
,Diet_cola,2010-11-27T10:42Z,"Vietnam - 58,159 dead; 1,719 missing; 303,635 wounded.   Result :-   Asses kicked by a group farmers and ill-equiped villages hiding in fields and tunnels.

Iraq - 21 Days To invade and take control of Baghdad - Still there 7 years later Fighing insurgents and people who obviously dont want you there.  Result :- You failed to compleat your objective of securing a country and its people for the oil.

Afghanistan :- 1,324 Dead, 7,819 Wounded.  Result :- Again, Asses getting Kicked by a group of people who dont want you there.

WW1 - 
4,355,000 Mobilized
116,708 - KIA
205,690 - Wounded
Total of 7% of your forces raised Killed or Wounded
Result :-  Chicken Shits compared to other countries such as russia who lost or had wounded 56% of there 6 million Plus, Combatants Killed or wounded.

WW2
Killed - 416,000
a Tiny amount compared to other contries and the forces they sent into battle.

Over All Americans Put themselfs forward as the last superpower on the face of the planet,  capable of going to any war, any time.  however you end up getting your asses kicked or suffering total losses % far below those of other countires who send more Troops.   Your Goverment is a Chicken Shit Authority who care more about how they look, and how there seen to behave, than actually finishing somthing they start.

However,  the american people are friendly, pleaseant and on the whole a decent buch of people,  even if they are blinded by media and coporate propganda stating how great they are."

,ktay,2010-12-01T02:01Z,keep ignorant opinions to yourself! If you are arguing military figures then go for it; but don't throw terrorist attacks into it. The 9/11 attack has nothing to do with the military capabilities. For that fact I would think twice before taking the subway in Moscow!!!
,Diet_cola,2010-12-02T00:29Z,"[The 9/11 attack has nothing to do with the military capabilities.]

Really ?   
then how come your so called military capabilities failed to stop not 1 but 3 planes from hitting there targets (if the Pentagon was even hit by a plane)  with the 4th one being taken down by the passengers.

How come your military leaders sent only 2 jets out to sea instead of directly to NY.  not only did you get your asses kicked, but you got shown how cleaver your military leaders are.

[I would think twice before taking the subway in Moscow!!!]

So would I,  but then I have never been to moscow,  and neither would I want to,  its full of commie hippi shits."

M: I like documentaries and although this one was decent, I felt they could've done a better job conveying the issues.  It felt a bit hollywood with the aerial shots/ security cam shots/ Oppenheimer clips/ cheesy bit at the end with everyone saying zero.  Again, decent but defn lacking the Attenborough-esque seriousness and sophistication.

Thanks for torrent, .BONE.!"
,Raptor910,2011-02-20T08:19Z,"Its the people who believe in the myths of jesus and religion who say it cant be done... it makes me sick to know people believe in crap like that.  Demand Zero, it can be done, must be done.  "

 The truth is that because of our ""freedom"" the government at the time was not allowed to invade peoples privacy in ways like tapping phones due to the rights expressed in the constitution. So even though the NSA were tapping these hijackers and tracing them quite well, they claim it would have been illegal for them to give the info to the FBI which is the only branch that has the authority of issuing a National Fugitive warrant because they were in the wrong and claim they would have been fired for invading the terrorists privacy to begin with. So they kept it hush hush. Some time after Bush passed the Patriot Act which gives them the right to invade your privacy whenever they like. This is why they're called terrorists, because they create terror, and as a result to prevent the terror we lose our freedom.

Every few generations, values and freedoms are lost and replaced artificial happiness and other standards, until everything is grey, and there is nothing else left to lose. 

TV, Radio & Magazines Its all illusions of someone else's fantasy. Just be glad your apart of it, because afterall you could live in a place in time like Jonah from the book The Giver. Great read by the way.
