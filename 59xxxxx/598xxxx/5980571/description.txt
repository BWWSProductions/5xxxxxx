Barbara Kopple

Genres:
Documentary 

Once the dominant force in heavyweight boxing, Mike Tyson used his fury inside the ring to 
pummel opponents; sadly, that anger outside the ring led to his undoing. Through interviews 
with Tyson's boyhood pals, sportswriters and others, this A&E documentary profiles the champ's 
knockout career and turbulent personal life -- including the rape conviction that sent him to 
prison. The film also looks at Tyson's efforts to rebuild his life.
