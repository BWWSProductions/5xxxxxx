Jimmie Vaughan Blues, Ballads And Favorites(mp3 320kbs)ICM369
_____________________________________________________________

The blues-rock master's first album in nine years! Blues, Ballads and Favorites
is blues-rock pioneer Jimmie Vaughan's tribute to the music that inspired him,
with covers of songs by Little Richard, Jimmy Reed, Roy Milton, Roscoe Gordon
and others.

The album was recorded in Austin, Texas, and features legendary blues singer
Lou Ann Barton on two tracks.

Other highlights include a brand-new instrumental, "Comin' & Goin'," and a
version of Willie Nelson's "Funny How Time Slips Away" featuring vocals by
Bill Willis, the famed Hammond organ player who recorded with James Brown
and Bill Doggett.

Vaughan founded the iconic Fabulous Thunderbirds in 1974, and they became
famous for the high-octane blues-rock sound that earned them critical acclaim
in the '70s and platinum-selling albums in the '80s. In 1990, Vaughan recorded
a duets album, Family Style, with his brother, Stevie Ray Vaughan, shortly before
the latter's untimely death, and then went on to a successful solo career.
