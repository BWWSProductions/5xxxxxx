it seems that many peoples are not happy with the list including me
so what u think about a voteing with the list like  5 vote for a movie or something like that
ignore me if you think its not good or impossible
plz think about it.."
[V],prashant22,2010-11-27T13:33Z,"@prank
welcome..
nd yes its possible because of lenght of movie.."
[V],prashant22,2010-11-27T13:51Z,"@himansu
buddy u r nt happy because only one of ur requests was considered...i would hv considered cinderella man bt there was no source i already told...
there will be no changes in the list i already thought a lot while making the list...i had made clear before that my list will nt be based on making everyone happy by taking everyone's request...
bt it will be purely on the conditions i already wrote..
i know why some of u people r nt happy and u know that too..bt i hv choosen the best movies..
plz re think take a look at the imdb ratings read the plot of the movies i hv selected...they r all good"
,kanha,2010-11-27T14:50Z,"for Cinderella man, u can get from here:

hey DSIN i'll also DL ur uploads.is advance booking allowed???.lol"
,jarman007,2010-11-28T02:53Z,"@ apple016
thanks for mocking us.............lol

always happy to humour anyone  :d"
,DSIN,2010-11-28T07:19Z,"@apple : LOL... read those comments again ...  :D
we weren't debating abt my uploads ...but my requested movies :-P


@all : i just dloaded step up 3 480p version from twentyforty... & damn.. its the best 480p version i ever watched in my life..
look at this :-
""Bit rate mode               : Variable
Bit rate                         : 1 168 Kbps
Maximum bit rate           : 18.1 Mbps
Width                            : 720 pixels
Height                           : 416 pixels""..
the print is really amazing... & ""prank"" will agree :D

@prashant : so dude.. iam wondering... if using variable bitrate might be more advantageous ?
iam gonna do some experiments using variable & then avg bitrates & observe Quality difference :D"
,himansu_007,2010-11-28T07:56Z,I think prashant is also doing rips in VBR not CBR and em pretty sure that his upload of stepup will rock..
[V],prashant22,2010-11-28T08:19Z,"@DSIN
avg bit rate means variable only..i mean to say how avg is calculate???
by adding like (a+b+c+d)/4
so like that only we set avg bitrate to like 800kbps, the bit rate actually varies from high bitrate scene to low bitrate scene and the avg of bitrates we get is 800kbps...
so the bitrate mode is variable when u use avg bitrate..."
[V],prashant22,2010-11-28T08:24Z,"@himansu
ya it will rock...
look at the size of 20-40's rip 1gb...it must be awesome in quality.."
,DSIN,2010-11-28T08:49Z,"^ dude.. i know he uses VBR..thats y i asked him...(i use mediainfo on every file i dload) 
since i encode only anime & music videos... mostly i use CBR :D
;)"
,DSIN,2010-11-28T08:54Z,"^ya srry for that... 
yup..the quality is really off the charts... 
i'll dload ur 720p too...  for bravia :D
iam burning way too many dvd's ... since i'm out of space.. LOL"
,apple016,2010-11-28T15:09Z,"@DSIN 
yeah i knw that u both guys debating on Cinderella man or some other movie. but whatever the point u both are good in what i said in my last comment.lol
but that was the relief that fight was fought in healthy mood.(i mean to say no harm to friendship or generous ship.)"
,prank0007,2010-11-28T17:04Z,"@DSIN 
surely i agree nice print in 480p
