[plot]
In Barrow, Alaska, seventy percent of the population of five hundred and some dwellers travels on the day of the last sunset, since the town will stay along the next thirty days without sun light. Sheriff Eben Oleson and Deputy Billy Kitka find many cell phones burned on the road. Then they receive a phone call from the local creator telling that his dogs have been slaughtered; later Eben finds the operator of the cell tower decapitated. He arrests a troublemaker drifter and the stranger frightens him telling that "they are coming and the locals will be dead". Sooner Eben discovers that the town is under siege and attacked by a gang of bloodthirsty vampires, and together with a few survivors, they hide in a empty cellar expecting for the next sunrise.
