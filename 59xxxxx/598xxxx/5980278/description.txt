Once upon a time, NineT9Mustang had an SVN up with a whole bunch of images for use as thumbnails within XBMC on the Xbox (thumbnails for games, programs, movies, and so on). Then his free host went down, taking all that with them.

So here it is again. I've added some stuff to it as well, mostly thumbnails for GB/GBA games.

This is by no means a definitive collection of thumbs, but it's a good start if you at least want wide banners for all your Xbox games. Also contains 3D box art images.
