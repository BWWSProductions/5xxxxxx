[V],-jonny-,2010-12-30T20:39Z,You can remove audio tracks with mkvmerge
,VYCanisMajoris,2011-06-04T08:43Z,"If you are using VLC. A free program that plays just about everything so I don't know why you would not want to use it. Just right click and you can change it to English and remove the subtitles with a few easy clicks.

Under Audio
>Audio track
>>DTS, 6ch 1536kbps [English] 

Under Video
>Subtitles Track
>>Disable"

FYI"
,summerHereKids,2011-06-18T23:20Z,"VYCanisMajoris is right.
VLC plays (almost) everything. Its free, open-source, lightweight.. its brilliant. Never had any issues with it. And no coded packs needed. So you're other programs don't get messed up.

Just be careful when you install: select the correct filetypes you want VLC to play. Eg: I selected all video files for VLC. So I can still play all audio with WMP or whatever program you prefer for audio.

Oh, and VLC exists for Windows, MAc and Linux."
,whazzup3929,2011-08-01T07:55Z,agreed...WMP is the WORST thing out there along with IE...KMPlayer is the fucking shit..so many fucking SETTINGS!..thanks uploader!
