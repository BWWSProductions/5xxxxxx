HOW CAN PEOPLE BE SO STUPID TO ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT A GOD, IF THERE WAS ONE, WOULD NEED TO SEND SOMEONE TO SUFFER HERE IN ORDER FOR HIM TO FORGIVE OUR ""SINS"" ? SUCH CONVOLUTED, SURREALISTIC, RIDICULOUS IDEA CAN COME ONLY FROM MINDS POISONED BY THE VIRUS OF RELIGION, BY WHICH THOSE PEOPLE PUT THE REASON THEY NORMALLY USE IN THEY EVERYDAY LIVES TO SLEEP AND THEN ENGAGE IN THE MOST ABSURD BELIEFS. PEOPLE LIKE YOU MAKE ME DOUBT ABOUT THE FUTURE OF MANKIND..."
