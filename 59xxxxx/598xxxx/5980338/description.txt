Well, here\\\'s the long awaited James Last: Christmas Dancing album. I could not find any other music similar to this on TPB, so I uploaded this. 
I ripped this from vinyl, converted to 320kbps through audacity.
Clicks and pops have been removed, and white space added between the tracks.

Seed and enjoy :D
