,Generica,2010-11-24T17:03Z,"Sorry about them being MP3's. They're still a constant 320kbps, so it's similar to them being FLAC. For some reason the torrent would not upload to the Music part of this site. "
,ddawg,2010-11-25T00:40Z,"Generica, although your contribution is appreciated -- MP3's @320 and lossless are in no way similar -- They're not even close.  Many of us will not touch an MP3 and even the lossless files we d/l are tested for authenticity with utilities such as Audiochecker or Tau Analyzer.  Even though I have hearing issues I can hear the difference in many instances.  For your consideration as an example compare many US produced CD's that are poorly manufactured and/or engineered to those of Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs (MFSL), Japanese remastered CD's or those of Similiar high quaity.  The sound is by far superior.

Another no-no is converting MP3's to Lossless (aka transoding)."
,ddawg,2010-11-25T00:45Z,Hey I forget to mention thta if you'd like a very simple program to ripe CD's to flac.. try winamp.   It's free
,Generica,2010-11-25T04:11Z,"Thing is, it isn't a CD. It's been ripped from vinyl, and thats why there are pops a crackles and other audio distortion. I still have the .wav lossless files, but those would total out to 380MB in total instead of 88. For some reason I can't change the category that this torrent is in.

But thanks everyone for seeding, I don't have the best connection."
