,remedy2,2010-12-06T21:45Z,"Scanned it with Norton and MS Security Essentials came up clean.  I installed it and the reason it is an exe is the uploader made some program with menus and embedded windows media player so you could just click on which chapter you want to play.  Totally unnecessary of course save for the fact the program also has some BS text ads that you can click on to make the uploader some money.  The whole download is a waste of time since you can just go to http://lessonsland.com/joomla-course.html and see the lessons free through embedded youtube vids.  I haven't check out the lessons long enough to know if they are worth viewing, only that this download/install is a waste of time. "
