I realize that they are probably just downrezzed versions of the 720p releases and you want to get the release out fast (which you do incredibly well.  Nice job on that.)  But it's confusing when releases that aren't HD are labeled ""HDTV"".

Please be sure to put the correct label on your releases.  The HDTV label is for 720p, 1080p and higher resolutions only.

Otherwise, thanks for the fantastically fast release, you guys really are the best."
