They have not tried something new from what I can deduce by listening the album thorugh, start to finish. (Finish, heh heh...) Still... if you can afford: Buy it, the music is great!"

,Gr33np0w3R,2010-12-27T11:52Z,"Low quality it is yes, all kinds of distortions when listening. Will be forced to do a rip myself... Such waste of time waiting for it though. :P"
