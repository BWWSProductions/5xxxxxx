,smknjoker,2010-11-24T21:27Z,Thanks bro. I'll check it out.
,shonen_,2010-11-24T21:51Z,"pretty watchable, not enjoyable though.
nice try though!"
,Fabianfrabb,2010-11-24T22:46Z,"Best quality so far, and downloading at 1.8 mbit sec, though not so good synced but best so far!"
,keith23uk,2010-11-25T04:06Z,Thanks for this. FYI Imagine to release theirs as soon as they have synced their line audio
,mortarupload,2010-11-25T04:31Z,cheers. will be getting a member on MoRT! to sync this tonight. with TS audio.
,representa715,2010-11-25T04:57Z,1.8 mb/s??? Mine was going really fast till about 66% and now i'm creeping... Hope its worth the wait!! loved this movie in the theaters
,Ebook-Cafe,2010-11-25T06:05Z,pls seed guys. speed is horrible
,dk471bb,2010-11-25T06:39Z,"froggie100, 
what Russian video are you talking about? I have searched through all the Russian torrents (incl. elektrichka) and there is only that crappy spanish version "
,danford,2010-11-25T06:46Z,"@suicnwt, or whatever...

go away..."
,representa715,2010-11-25T07:23Z,"finally done downloading....will seed.... Is the most clear copy....audio not sync'd well... watermark is there... hides cam a few times.... 
audio-7 (when sync'd)
video - 7 (when cams not hidden)
enjoyability - 6...i still enjoyed watching it without paying another $10.50"
,keith23uk,2010-11-25T07:38Z,RELIZLAB is the Russian source as it states. The first 36 minutes are the screener again. The sync is an olympic mile out!!! Several minutes out!! Be warned!!! But the quality of the cam video is very very encouraging. BUT DONT DOWNLOAD IF YOU ARE GOING TO WATCH THIS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SYNC YOURSELF! Typical nub attempt at syncing no sync points used at all just think can move audio and everything would be fine.... DONT WASTE YOUR BANDWIDTH ON THIS ONE.
,keith23uk,2010-11-25T07:41Z,If i had fast upload speed I would work on this myself but alas here in the UK our upload speeds stink because our internet is so crowded. Last time I tried syncing was a lot closer than this though. Suggest wait for Imagines hard work!
,dk471bb,2010-11-25T08:37Z,"I checked this one 
the second part of the video is much better than all the others I have seen before
but audio is TOTALLY out of sync. Don't waste your time on this torrent.  "
,Nyphot,2010-11-25T09:14Z,DLing now. Thanks. Mortar will have it up when we're done syncing. Thanks so much!
,csiham,2010-11-25T14:12Z,"thanks froggie100..

,RareNinja,2010-11-25T14:28Z,cheers dude... just wondering what program u use to extract & sync audio to vid files?
,godofwrath08,2010-11-25T16:17Z,i downloaded this four times to make sure the video is fine at really low resoultion like an ipod but the audio is out of sync badly like really noticeable so thumbs up for the upload but this is another unwatchable copy
,godofwrath08,2010-11-25T16:20Z,and for gods sake u gret noob yai9639 stop posting links to surveys unless u agree to being a obv noob.
,DuskRose666ss,2010-11-25T17:40Z,best cam version ive come across a10 v10 altho it is a cam so this is a cam rating 
[V],.BONE.,2010-11-25T19:37Z,best copy yet but out! of! sync! 
,champe10,2010-11-25T21:22Z,"Has anyone found a good setting for the audio sync problem in VLC media player.  Usually I can figure it out by playing with the settings in the Adjustments and Effects menu, but the audio is so far off that I have not been able to get the ""advance of audio over video"" setting correct.  Has anyone got a good, solid +/- number setting yet?"
,pteradactyle,2010-11-25T23:12Z,"I FIGURED OUT THE AUDIO TIMING

IM USING CCCP or MPC

AND THE AUDIO SETTING FOR ME ARE 

-3600 ms"
,pteradactyle,2010-11-25T23:15Z,damn it...it was -3600 now its like -6000
,pteradactyle,2010-11-25T23:17Z,when u see snape/snake what ever the hell his name is ...set it to -9000
,Traziz,2010-11-26T02:53Z,"For me, I use AC3 filter, and in the settings while the video is playing (use icon on taskbar) goto system tab and put -3.925e+004 into the jitter box."
,harrynuttsack,2010-11-26T04:13Z,can anybody fix the audio and reload this because it is totally out of sync .video is the best so far.
,highlander777,2010-11-26T04:47Z,Thanks for the effort but the audio is so far out of sync it's not funny.
[V],WeeKnighT,2010-11-26T07:23Z,"Thanks for the advice Traziz.
Saved me a lot of trial and error"
,leechmaster12321,2010-11-26T23:11Z,"convert it to 24fps first using virtualdub or yaai, then its fairly easy to sync, i think -200ms or -400ms did it for me

and by the way try this if you cant do it urself

,Argetlam22,2010-11-27T20:59Z,"This video keep moving back and forth, it really pissed me off. If you people enjoy a case of can't-keep-the-cam-on-the-screen, then this torrent is a sure bet for you."
,Denly,2010-11-28T07:18Z,Hy Don't download audio i sucs V-5 A-0
