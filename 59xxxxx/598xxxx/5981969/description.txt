Finally a good copy of this video! Much thanks goes out to 2nafish for providing the source video and re-seeding it for me today.

The video itself was a 16:9 video embedded into a 4:3 file, like it is on tv. So I cropped the black areas and made this file a pure 16:9 one. The original was interlaced and this one here has been made progressive.

I replaced the tv audio with CD audio for the best quality possible.

Video = MPEG-2 NTSC 16:9 29.97 fps 720 x 480, 2nafish previous rip source

Audio = 224 kbps .ac3 @ 48 KHz, CD source

That was really nice to have re-seeded just for me, so hopefully you all enjoy this too as a thanks. So thanks again 2nafish!

File is ready for DVD Authoring.

Enjoy!
