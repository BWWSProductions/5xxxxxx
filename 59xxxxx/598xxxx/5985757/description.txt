Welcome thugs and ladies alike to DJ Sinatra's Blaxploitation Mixtape Deluxe 3 Disc Edition! This little essay you're reading is meant to accompany these albums for further insight and information into the music and the process of making this all. The most important thing DJ Sinatra would like to make clear is that this is in no way the definitive collection or that these songs are best represented here. Please go out and support the artists you hear in the tracks by buying the stuff you like. This is a celebration of the black films of the seventies, their essence and flavor with context and history. Hopefully you'll be interested enough to find some of these old films if you haven't already and if not then at least enjoy these sweet collections. So here's what you'll be listening to:

This is the mixtape proper. Hosted by Ice-T, this disc features music from hip hop artists only when they've sampled music from a blaxploitation film. For example; the theme from Shaft recorded by Isaac Hayes was sampled for a song by Jay-Z called Reservoir Dogs and then is edited so only the two best verses (Jay-Z and Jadakiss) remain. This is done for time and for flow. Sometimes a track is great, but at this point in the mix you want to move quickly and not stop for a five minute song.

The interludes take you through some of the main characters in these films accompanied by different quotes and cuts from the actual movies.

There are also two tracks exclusively remixed for this mixtape.

As I said before, this is not a definitive list and in fact there many other tracks sampling blaxploitation scores that were left off for various reasons. Little Ghetto Boy for instance just seemed a little too obvious and over played. Where as Redman's Creepin' just didn't fit into the flow of the album anywhere. Below is a list of tracks that weren't used but could have been.

Dr. Dre - Little Ghetto Boy
Redman - Creepin\'
Snoop Dogg - Dolmite
Gangstarr - Next Time
Gangstarr - Take A Rest
TI - Help Is Coming
Quasimoto feat. Mr. Herb -Discipline 99 Part 0

***Bonus Tracks***
19. Hell Razah - Cinematic
20. Dolemite Vs. Big Daddy Kane

This disc is a collection of songs that were sampled to make the beats on disc one. This is fantastic music in it's own right and it only seemed right to celebrate the original music and give credit where it's due. Also because I had an excess of interlude material. Blaxploitation films have such rich dialogue and so many amazing moments, it was easy to have a billion great quotes to sample. I used this disc to save some of them from the cutting room floor. One such track Big Daddy Kane Vs. Dolemite which didn't seem to fit anywhere on the other disc, was pretty much impossible to leave off of a compilation like this. Listen to the song and you'll understand why. Also included is Wu Tang affiliate Hell Razah's newest track; Cinematic, a true homage to these movies.

Disc 3:

The third disc is the Fancore Pirate Radio special, hosted by critic and Blaxploitation enthusiast Jonny Botsch. The music is mostly compiled from the other two discs but with a completely different flow to the track selection. Also, as with most of Fancore's music related shows, they have radio commercials and trailers that fit into the theme of the show.  This episode wasn't constrained by any kind of time issue since the format was intended for a streaming podcast.

The Research:

In preparation and all during the production of all three discs, I delved into my collection of films and even ordered several new ones online to add to the library. These are the movies that I took samples from or simply watched for more inspiration. Not all are great, but they are fun. So just in case you were wondering, this is the list of films:

Shaft, Shaft's Big Score, Shaft in Africa
Black Shampoo
Coffy, Foxy Brown, Sheba Baby, Friday Foster
Cotton Comes To Harlem
Truck Turner
Blacula, Scream Blacula Scream
Black Belt Jones, Hot Potato
Black Samson
Three The Hard Way
Enter the Dragon
Get Christie Love
Original Gangstas
Black Mama White Mama
Slaughter, Slaughter's Big Rip Off
Cleopatra Jones, Cleo and the City of Gold
Across 110th Street
Bucktown
The Big Doll House
TNT Jackson
Black Dynamite
Jackie Brown
Vanishing Point (Not fully Blaxploitation but definitely a great movie and the radio DJ Supersoul is the main reason for it to be on this list.)
The Mack
That Man Bolt

Also highly recommended is Josiah Howard's book: Blaxploitation Cinema: The Essential Reference Guide. I found it to be comprehensive and thorough. Although I don\'t agree with all of the reviews, (Bucktown for example was better than I expected having read the review first) there are so many movies covered and many that I had never heard of and a great breakdown defining these genre movies and chronicling their birth. There are also ten interviews with directors of Blaxploitation movies that is worth the price on the cover alone.
