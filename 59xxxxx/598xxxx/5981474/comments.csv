,nenaddorcol,2010-12-04T01:45Z,oh i forgot to say after you activate go to C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Temp and delete all files in folder you must do that to protect the loader info ! Than go to http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/ValidateNow.aspx?displaylang=en

E viva a bucetì°½ncia!"
,brianxxx,2011-01-23T17:58Z,"This is one of the very best activators out there. But yes, in some circumstances it will not work. I have found some odd occasions that Dell or HP laptops won't work with this...whether 32 or 64 bit. 

Truthfully, IMO doing BIOS mods for activation is the only way to go these days. Fast, clean and simple.

I only use this LOADER for my VMWARE machines since it works so well and allows me to test without headaches.
