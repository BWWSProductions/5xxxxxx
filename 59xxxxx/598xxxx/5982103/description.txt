I've already uploaded this on Demonoid so there is a bunch of seeders ready to go.

Here are the instructions, verbatim:

DO NOT LET THE PROGRAM ONTO INTERNET!

You can add the following lines in C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts:

127.0.0.1   87.98.165.24
127.0.0.1   91.121.154.202

Do not forget block the program AND the updater through your firewall if necessary.

1. Shutdown internet connection.

2. Install vcredist_x86.exe (If needed)

3. Install Guitar_Pro_6.0.7_b2_r8924_Repack_Setup.exe

4. Run crack_x86.exe or crack_x64.exe (accordingly to your architecture).

5. Run the program.

6. Agree for file associations, if you like.

7. Install the RSE2 by double clicking

8. Restart the program.

If program crashes on all your actions delete folder
2000/XP: Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Guitar Pro 6\
Vista/7: ProgramData\Guitar Pro 6\
from system volume
or delete all 'Guitar Pro 6', 'GuitarPro' and 'Arobas Music'
records in registry and system drive
BEFORE INSTALLATION.

This is in the readme, although I added a few addendums here to compensate for poor translating.

My anti-virus software doesn't detect anything from this but as always be on the side of caution. I wouldn't upload it if I knew there was a virus

Just in case...

Magnet URI:
magnet:?xt=urn:btih:623HGC7YZRSDBB7NY5QLDSX4K263WF6K

Recently I've had problems with torrents not uploading properly, so now I take the side of caution.

EDIT::.

I noticed that TPB Nazi'd the tracker list removing the demonoid tracker so if you'd like more seeders just add this to the tracker list:


http : // inferno . demonoid . com : 3409 / announce

just leave out the spaces...
