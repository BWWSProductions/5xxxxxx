,metzalx,2010-11-27T10:12Z,Does this work on Windows 7 Home Premium? There were a lot of previous torrents that didn't and kept asking for the reg code :(
,serosis,2010-11-27T17:03Z,"I'm using it on Home Premium x64.

Just make sure it never connects to the internet, block it any way you can."
,metzalx,2010-11-30T16:00Z,Alright thanks! Will try as soon as the torrent finishes downloading :D
,feruzatan,2010-12-02T03:31Z,"GUYS, GUYS, GUYS!...

I'VE BEEN USING GP6 WITHOUT FROM DAY 1 SINCE IT IS AVAILABLE IN TPB. HAVE BEEN SELLING IT TOO (LOL) WHO COULDN'T FIGURE OUT TO SOLVE THE REGISTRATION CODE PROBLEM

MOST OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE TORRENTS' INSTRUCTIONS ARE 90% COMPLETE AND WILL END UP WITH THE REGISTRATION CODE PROBLEM.

HERE'S THE TRICK. THE NO. 1 INSTRUCTION - BEFORE INSTALLING GP6
1) GO TO NETWORK AND SHARING CENTRE IN CONTROL PANEL - CLICK
2) CHANGE ADAPTER SETTINGS - CLICK
3) RIGHT CLICK AT 'LOCAL AREA CONNECTION'  AND CLICK ON 'PROPERTIES'
4) THEN CLICK 'CONFIGURE'
5) THEN CLICK AT THE  'ADVANCED' TAB
6) THEN CLICK AT 'NETWORK ADDRESS'
7) THEN AT THIS ' 0024211EAA99 ' AT THE VALUE EMPTY SPACE. THEN PRESS OK

IT IS THEN YOU CARRY ON INSTALLING INSTRUCTIONS. MSG ME IF YOU GOT PROBLEM(I doubt you have). It's high time to make money from the college boys noobs and beginners(Shhh! don't share this secret with anyone) -

 How can I install it on Vista 32x ? Cause there are only for x86 and x64 .
I try with x64 , but when I run the program , it tells me to enter the serial key. Is it normal ?

Thanks for your help :)"

Choose browse (look for the guitar pro 6 you just installed in program files or somewhere else.) Select GuitarPro (22.044 kB) Then it just installs!

Worked for me, and I'm not the best @ installing stuff!
Hope it works for you too!"
