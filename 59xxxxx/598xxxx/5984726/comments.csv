,svetlania09,2010-11-25T22:33Z,"@xyrec, I am out visiting the parental units for Thanksgiving.  As soon as I get back this weekend I will get the latest one updated.  I am currently using 1516 on my laptop right now and the bugs are very minor and I haven't noticed any other than the occasional person in the wrong spot or the viewer not auto-advancing."
,Xyrec,2010-11-26T14:00Z,@svetlania09 I uploaded 2.0.1521 myself. :D
