[W4F PRESENTS]: 
Azorian.The.Raising.Of.The.K129.Part2.HDTV.XviD-W4F


[AIR DATE] 2010/11/26
[RELEASE DATE]: 2010/11/27

Genre: Documentary


Description:

For over six years, the wreck of the Soviet submarine K-129 had 
lain in the dark abyss and shifting silt of the North Pacific. From its 
loss in March 1968 until its exposure in March 1974, the world was 
unaware that the Russians had lost a strategic missile submarine with 
its three one megaton thermo-nuclear warheads, and two nuclear-
tipped torpedoes.

The Soviet Government was equally unaware that the US had located 
and photographed the wreck and was preparing the largest marine 
salvage operation in history to raise the K-129.

Project AZORIAN, which was eventually known inaccurately to the 
general public as Project Jennifer, was the CIAs audacious attempt 
to recover the K-129 wreck using a specially designed salvage vessel, 
named the Hughes Glomar Explorer.

Representing the most modern missile-carrying submarine then in the 
Soviet inventory, the K-129 offered the US a cornucopia of unique 
intelligence targets, ranging from nuclear weapons to cryptographic 
systems and other equipment. But retrieving it required $1.8 billion (in 
todays dollars) and more than six years to design and build the 
equipment that could do the impossible.

To this day, Project AZORIAN is the deepest salvage operation ever 
attempted and was so far beyond the cutting-edge of 1970s 
technology that the Soviets considered it to be impossible.

A brief flurry of press attention in 1975 resulted in a special 
presidential gag order being put in place by then President Gerald 
Ford. This security provision has effectively blocked normal 
declassification systems and Freedom of Information Act requests to 
this day.

Finally, however, some mission members and senior engineers of 
Project AZORIAN have stepped out of the shadows to help tell this 
dramatic story in their own words. Utilising extensive, accurate CGI 
reconstruction of the salvage attempt, plus never before seen film of 
the actual recovery itself, and based upon contemporaneous 
documents, AZORIAN: The Raising of K-129 provides the first factual 
and documented account of this unique event ever made available 
outside the confines of US Intelligence agencies.
