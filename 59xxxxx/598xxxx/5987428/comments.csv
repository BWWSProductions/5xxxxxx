But until such time there are more seeders and peers your download speed may be a bit slow.

Remember to seed back when you have the files in order to increase the download speed for new users! :)"
,mrsmama,2010-12-14T01:27Z,Thank you SO SO SO SO SO much for this :-)  My girls are huge Signing Time fans!  Can't wait for the 2nd series.  You're a miracle worker!

Do you happen to have the music from these programs?  "

Do you happen to have the music from these programs?  I would like to make CDs for my kids to listen the songs in the car..."
,Saki33,2011-02-14T00:59Z,"Thank you very much. I am getting these for a friend who has autistic children to learn signing. Had already gotten vols 1-8 from Demonoid before I thought to look for it as Signing Time. I only searched for ASL and that's not in your tags. If TPB ever enables torrent editing again I suggest adding ASL to your tags.

For anyone who wants CD's, you could make your own. Download Any Video Converter (free) and convert the avi to a sound file. This would mean you'd have to find the time slots for the songs on the avi and enter them before converting. Obviously time-consuming to do, but they do convert quickly. Alternatively, you could do it with your computer's recorder."
,Saki33,2011-02-14T21:48Z,"These are excellent learning tools and I really appreciate the uploads. I downloaded the first 8 from Demonoid before I found this more complete collection here. They have a such a high ratio at Demonoid that I am unable to seed anything back, so I copied the 8 into this folder so I can help seed all of the episodes.

Rachel Coleman has done an excellent job with this project, but the prices seem very high. She has made each episode about 30 mins and each one a separate DVD album. She has priced each one at $22. It really seems very high for what should not be an expensive production. The videos are not really high quality and the actors can't have cost much. I can understand someone wanting to make money from their efforts, but I think they could have been priced better. I would have considered buying them to support her efforts if they didn't cost so much. These are for a family with an autistic child that can't afford to buy them. "
,cstu,2011-09-04T05:40Z,Anyone know where to get Signing Time series 2?  This show is great for my autistic daughter and I will keep it seed.  Thanks!

,destructoPop,2012-05-14T07:31Z,"Thank you so much for sharing this. ASL is too important to America to not be free and accessible! Now we can only hope BSL, DGS, AusLan, and the rest get programs like this and sharers like you!"
