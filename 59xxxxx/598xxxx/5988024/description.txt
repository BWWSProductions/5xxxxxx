CINEMA16 celebrates the short film by showcasing some of the best classic and award-winning shorts on DVD.

Aside from providing short films with a much needed platform CINEMA16 gives filmmakers and movie-lovers access to some great films that would otherwise be near impossible to see, from the fascinating early works of some of America?s greatest directors to award-winning films from its most exciting new filmmakers. CINEMA16 represents the best examples from all short form genres ? from underground experimental films through to mainstream comedies.

With over three hours of films CINEMA16: AMERICAN SHORT FILMS is essential viewing for anyone with an interest in the moving image. The majority of the films are accompanied by audio commentaries, almost always by the directors themselves. The release of CINEMA16: AMERICAN SHORT FILMS follows the success of CINEMA16?s first collection ofshort films - featuring Chris Nolan, Ridley Scott, Mike Leigh, Stephen Daldry, Lynne Ramsay and Peter Greenaway amongst others - and it?s follow-up EUROPEAN SHORT FILMS -featuring Lars von Trier, Jean Luc Godard and Lukas Moodysson ? further demonstrating it?s dedication to this important area of filmmaking.
