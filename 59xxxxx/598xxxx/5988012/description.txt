Chris Rea Blue Guitars Album 1(Beginnings)(mp3 320 kbs)ICM369
_____________________________________________________________

Blue Guitars is a Blues album released by Chris Rea on October 14th 2005 
consisting of eleven CDs, one DVD and a full colour book, including paintings 
by the artist, liner notes and song lyrics. 

The album is an ambitious project with the 137 songs recorded over the course 
of 1 1/2 years with a work schedule - according to Chris Rea himself - of 
twelve hours a day, seven days a week.

The collection is the fifth and last release in a line of Blues recordings 
Chris Rea has made since recovering from a serious disease at the turn of the 
millennium and promising himself a return to his Bluesy roots in the event that 
he survived. 

According to Rea "Blue Guitars" will be his last solo effort; however, he will 
continue to release albums as a member of the band "Memphis Fireflies".

Albums

The eleven separate records which comprise "Blue Guitars" could as well stand on 
their own; in combination, however, they provide a journey through the different 
epochs of the Blues, showing the various components that have been added to the 
original African Blues over time, the changes in instrumentation, style, lyrical 
expression and thematic implications. 

Thereby Chris Rea and his band imitate the various styles and lyrical topics, 
creating an instantly recognisable atmosphere on each record, with the first few 
songs usually setting up the direction in which the record is going and then 
developing to various styles within the field of each record.

Album Number One - Beginnings
_____________________________

The first album of this set deals with the very beginnings of the Blues, tracing 
its ways back to its African roots. 

Living conditions were hard, many African natives were taken captives and 
transported across the ocean to be sold as slaves, sometimes even betrayed by 
their own people, which is vividly depicted in the song The King Who Sold His Own. 

All in all it was an environment, where it was only natural for the Blues to 
develop, and even though the instrumentation and the construction of the songs was 
still very different from what we now know as Blues, the basics were already there: 
the sadness, the strain, the burdens, the depression, the feeling of "blue" and of 
course the underlying musical structure.
