Allmusic Review:
If you like your Christmas tidings with a dollop of good humor, then this batch of holiday tunes is right up your alley. The lineup ranges from cute and innocuous (the Chipmunks, the Singing Dogs, and Spike Jones) to satirical (Stan Freberg and Allan Sherman) and just plain weird (Elmo and Patsy's "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer" and Tom Lehrer's "A Christmas Carol"). A fun seasonal alternative to Bing Crosby.
