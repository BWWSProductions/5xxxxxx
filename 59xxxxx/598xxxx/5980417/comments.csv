,1glenmore,2011-04-09T01:04Z,Good afternoon: can you tell me if this is the original version that was modified to pass the censors or is it the original version found in the Library of Congress in 2004? thank you in advance

Sure Hollywood was using sex, murder, adult themes to sell movies but that didn't mean it was all trash.  This is a CLASSIC film and shows how film and hollywood were developing, one must also take into account the time period, being the depression and between World Wars.  Sadly Sadly the Hayes Code neutered Hollywood to protect American values and deceny.  Barbera Stanwick is also a fine actress."
