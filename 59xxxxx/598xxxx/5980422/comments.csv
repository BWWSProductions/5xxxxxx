,Bigbapie,2010-11-24T20:27Z,how do you get it installed
,wakontol,2010-11-25T00:49Z,"Juz transfer the apk.file to your SD card and tap your droid application installer until you can see the aura logo and tap to install it.
Get back here if you still have a problem!!"
,geekfreak,2010-11-25T15:59Z,Does it work in pakistan?
,wakontol,2010-11-27T00:56Z,"As for right now aura is only having problem with the maps of Australia and Bermuda Triangle.
Pakistan shouldn't be a problem mate!"

,abgar,2011-01-08T13:32Z,"Be warned - does not work at all on devices without hadware accelerated 2D, like i5700 spica"
,fgiroux,2011-01-11T07:08Z,"I still don't understand how to install the app. I put the .apk file in my SD card but I don't know what to do next! You said we have to install it with my ""droid application installer""?? Whats that? Or do I need to install the free Aura navigation first? Thanks you for responding and for this torrent :)"
,MeMuppet2,2011-01-26T20:15Z,"When I start Aura, I get the message:
Not a database found i the map 'RES', please delete it and download again

Somebody an idea?"
,danatpifc,2011-02-25T07:40Z,Does not give the ability to download Australia or New Zealand Maps..:((
,Cmpunmu3,2011-04-27T03:37Z,"fgiroux
Download Apps Installer from Android market and you will understand everything later on"
,pete0726,2011-05-03T16:33Z,"Works Great !!!
Thank You !!!"
,DrAngst,2011-05-05T19:17Z,"Efter att ha laddat hem .apk-filen och installerat den så startar Aura Downloader.
I den väljer jag Sverige och laddar hem ca 315MB.

När detta är klart så försöker jag starta Aura (har 2st olika ikoner i telefonen, Aura och Aura Downloader (bägge har samma ikon)).

Spelar ingen roll vilken av dom jag startar så startar Aura Downloader och visar att jag inte har någonting kvar att ladda hem men kommer inte vidare.

Idéer om vad som kan vara fel?"
,DrAngst,2011-05-05T19:18Z,"....

Trycker jag på ""continue"" så säger programmet: Nothing Selected. Please select a map for download or removal.

???"
,Bober6996,2011-06-06T08:42Z,"Works great :-)
Just installed via HTC Application Installer, and first thing: download a map of preference via Aura Downloader, wich came with the torrent download. Fire up the Aura and set your preferred language and other settings. Off U go :-)"
