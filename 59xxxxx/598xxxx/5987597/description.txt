__________________________________________________________________


Moonfleet & Other Stories by Chris de Burgh is a musical journey
inspired by the book 'Moonfleet' - J Meade Falkner.

Taking us on this musical journey, Chris is joined by his Band,
The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and a Narrator.

Vocals, music and narration all run smoothly, each enhancing the
other to make a very powerful combination.

The listener is immediately captured, and held fast, for the
duration of the Story, which incorporates an Overture, 11 songs
and a Finale.

There is a balanced mix of toe tapping melodies, spine tingling
orchestrated songs and narration to make this Album quite unique.

Following the Moonfleet story the listener is treated to a further
6 songs about Guardian Angels, Lovers, Painters, The Joy of Llife,
culminating in the final song, People Of The World, written for an
innocent young woman called Neda, who was shot and killed at a
demonstration in Iran.
