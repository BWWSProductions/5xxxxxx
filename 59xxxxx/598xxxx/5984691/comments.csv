,Jnxd1,2010-11-30T07:23Z,"This movie is terrible. Aside from the complete lack of editing skills, lack of narrative,  and repeating the same off-topic comments and images until you want to smash your speakers, whatever ""message"" the creator of this video had was lost long before it ever started. It's downright laughable some of the FAR stretches this ""film"" makes. Like the complete and utter garbage with the ""Virgin"" logo (as in Richard Branson, Virgin Airlines, Virgin Megastore, etc). They turned it on it's side, erased parts of it, and then ""connected the dots"" of what was left in order to vaguely spell SEX. I'm crying bullshit on this one. DO NOT WASTE YOUR 2.5 HOURS WATCHING THIS. Don't forget, too, that the movie concludes on a poorly Photoshoped image designed to be ""definitive proof"" of, well, something... I want my 2.5hrs of my life back."
