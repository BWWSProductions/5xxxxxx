,antuan10,2010-12-16T08:18Z,"This album is not entirely explicit, only ""We R Who We R"" and ""C U Next Tuesday"" are exlicit, ""Sleazy"" and ""Crazy Beautiful Life"" are still censored, the rest of the songs are not explicit and not are censored, and the remix of ""Animal"" still got cut of (I think the song is that way), and please if someone can get the album entirely EXPLICIT please uploaded in a lossless format preferably FLAC."
,almstsane,2010-12-20T02:31Z,"Sleazy and Crazy Beautiful Life both have censoring even in the explicit versions. For example, she censors ""shit"" in CBL and then says ""been a shitty waitress"", so they're as uncensored as they get. The end of the Animal remix is intact, try deleting the MP3 and then redownloading it."
