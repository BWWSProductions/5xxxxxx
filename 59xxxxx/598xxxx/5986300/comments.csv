,Personal_Vendetta,2011-01-07T23:27Z,"@Whiterabbit2100

Its called 4x4=12 because deadmau5 entered 4x4 into a calculator and the calculator glitched, giving 12 as the answer lol 

Great album too, thanks for the ul! 

FLAC is good too :https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6032071/Deadmau5_-_4x4_12_-_2010"

,AndySee,2011-02-21T12:23Z,"What utter bullsh*t. Calculators don't glitch and give a wrong answer. I suspect someone pressed the wrong button with his clumsy mouse fingers.
Why was he trying to calculate 4x4 anyway? Should be called ThickMau5"

,foxtrot95,2011-04-02T04:42Z,"yea you are honestly retarded to believe that they actually made a mistake 4x4=12, its meant to be like that, its just like saying 2+2=5... read the book 1984 if your really that dumb! it will explain your stupidity."
,Izy26,2011-04-08T00:57Z,Created account just to laugh at noobs getting trolled in comment land! Feels so good.
,acehunter2,2011-05-08T20:56Z,The Reason why its 4x4=12 is normaly Deadmouse's songs are soo hucking random... lol look at animal rights etc lol its still good music :P

AWESOME MUSIC!!"
,wrathzilla,2011-09-06T01:46Z,"For those wondering:

4x4=16
16+the 5 in the name=21
21 backwards is 12
so that's how we get 4x4=12"
,ReedAS,2011-09-16T08:33Z,"Not sure if it has been said, but the reason it is 4X4=12 is:

4 X 4 = 16 + the 5 from Deadmau5 = 21. The mirror of 21 is 12.

,sheeptag,2011-11-05T19:46Z,"AndySee, you must not have taken algebra, give x a value of 0.75 and 4x4=12.  You just have to look at in a different light....ThickMau5? speak for yourself man."
