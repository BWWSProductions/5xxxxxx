                     A River Runs Through It - 1992



"A River Runs Through It" concerns the Macleans, a Presbyterian family during early 20th century Montana whose opinions of life are filtered through their passion for fly fishing. The novella is presented from the point of view of older brother Norman who goes on one last fishing trip with his rowdy and troubled younger brother Paul in an attempt to help him get his life on track.[1] After a brief introduction of his early life, most of the action takes place during the summer of 1937 and both Norman and Paul were in their early 30s
