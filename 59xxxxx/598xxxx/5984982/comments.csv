one thing though, am i right it saying this can't go full screen? im just using windows media player (>."
,ilovemycomputer,2011-02-22T00:12Z,"if you think its not axxo, simply download it and watch it on your own and DON'T SEED it and stfu. AT any rate, this is posted by a VIP and i dont think he wants his VIP status to be taken away so he wouldnt post anything (knowingly) that would be labeled as false. "
