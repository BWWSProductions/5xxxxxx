But my love for animated comics drove me to finding this torrent, and creating an account just to say thank you. I will seed this to 1.5 ratio @ 74 kb/s for the days it took me to download!"
,karlfunk,2011-02-26T10:46Z,Very good quality. By far the best B:TAS-torrent on TPB. Thank you very much for this.
,emueller,2012-06-12T22:13Z,"First, good job on the quality!
I was enjoying this quite well, and then I noticed some things.
Season One has episodes out of order, and some may be missing.
The rest of the seasons are too small and are out of order with many episodes missing.

This one is good, and has ALL episodes in the correct order, and also seems to be the only source for all of The New Batman Adventures.(The one that followed the famous animated series we seek on this page.)

Sadly, as of now there is only 1 seeder and about 16 leechers.

Just my opinion, but thank you piko4 for helping me entertain many children and a father with a memory disorder in the meanwhile. You brought much happiness to my family with this in the meanwhile as I seek the other episodes and series of the DC Animated Universe."
