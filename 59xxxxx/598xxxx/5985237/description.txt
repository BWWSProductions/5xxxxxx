Moriarty is a truly international band. Members hailing from Vietnam, France, Switzerland and The States. They may be a cultural boiling pot but for all that variety, it's odd how their music sounds genuinely folk, the American kind. 
A sly, crazed mix of swing, blues and folk, done with a black sense of humour that manages to punch a lot harder than the individual songs might suggest.
