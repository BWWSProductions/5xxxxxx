,Hotrodicus_Supersonicus,2010-11-28T19:09Z,Anyone try this out yet?
,gg2gg,2010-12-16T00:45Z,i burned this game but couldnt get it to work.....once i hit start the load wants to load but then fails after the intro
,Gromdrak,2011-01-02T22:54Z,"Burned at 2X (my burner's slowest speed). The iso burned fine, but about 2/3 through the game, there was an error that the disc was unreadable. I'm guessing this is no good. I could waste another disc, but I'll wait until someone can confirm that they have burned and played this all the way through."
,Gromdrak,2011-01-03T06:00Z,"As an update, I burned the iso again, and it works just fine, so far."
