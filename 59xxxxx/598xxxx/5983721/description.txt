Advanced Quantum Theory Has 
NEVER Been SO MUCH FUN!

Cutting Edge Physics & Ancient Spiritual Science Converge in Nassim Haramein's Classic 
"Crossing the Event Horizon!"

Scientist Nassim Haramein is unraveling the hidden geometric structure behind all Creation.
The "structure of the vacuum" is leading top physicists to rethink current theory and consider that the "unified field" they have been searching for is connected with the Vacuum and Spin Forces.
Haramein's discovery has unlocked keys within Ancient Sacred Science and is linking the Science of the Ancients with today's cutting edge research. Top experts claim that Haramein's "Unification View" of cosmology is mathematically valid could lead to the "Grand Unified Theory" physicists have been searching for since before Einstein's "E=MC^2".
Amazingly, Nassim Haramein's theory of physics unlocks important new understandings into Ancient Sacred Science... adding further proof that the ancient spiritual systems were not superstitious imaginings, but advanced methods used to manipulate and describe Universal Forces.
I recommend "Crossing the Event Horizon" to everyone with an interest in the convergence of Science and Spirit!
