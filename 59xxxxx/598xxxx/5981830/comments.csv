,yogdagon,2012-01-15T17:43Z,Thanx a lot. Works fine.
,bumba2,2012-01-16T07:18Z,"my personal exp-use this kmp build not the newer one available free on site.bcoz this older one is faster than the newer.u'll get more performance.modifications r negligible,u even may not recognise.

N.B-this opens a 720p in a second.newer one takes 5-6 seconds.it matters a lot!!!"
