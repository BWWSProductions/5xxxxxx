Little Blighty on the Down was a satirical radio comedy series broadcast on BBC Radio 4 between 1988 and 1992. It was a parody of contemporary life inas seen in the small village of Little Blighty. (Blighty being an old affectionate nickname fora down is a chalk hill, such as in England's South Downs; the village's name is thus suggestive of awhich is 'little' rather than 'great' in terms of importance or governance, and which shouldn't be described as being 'on the up').

These are NEW recordings and if you have the last posted version dump them and grab these.
When the BBC aired these I found I had 5 more than they seem to have.
I can't find a decent listing so I think each series has a Special (Not 2 specials as listed elsewhere)
I named then as 1 per series but they might not be in the correct order
