HOW TO START AION WITH YOUR OWN IP:

To Start AION on localhost, make a start.bat file with notepad and write:

start bin32\aion.bin -ip:127.0.0.1 -port:2106 -cc:1 -lang:enu -noauthgg -noweb
or
start bin32\aion.bin -ip:127.0.0.1 -port:2106 -cc:2 -lang:enu -noauthgg -noweb

and put it into your Aion Main Folder!


(if you have german installed, use: lang:deu; if you have french installed, use: lang:fra)

(if you have EU Client use cc:2, if you have NA Client, use cc:1 if you have RUS Client, use cc:7)
Default Setting is cc:1, if you have other cc, open "gameserver.properties" of "Novo's EasyAion Emulator\AIONEmulator\gameserver\config\main" with Notepad:

# Server Country Code (cc)
# (CountryCode has to be the same as in start.bat Launcher)
# (cc:1 is for NA Client, cc:2 is for EU Client, cc:7 is for RUS Client)
gameserver.country.code=1


! Don't forget: !
You NEED to copy fyyre's "d3dx9_38.dll" from "\Tools\Aion Launcher\Disable Login IP Check fix" to "Aion\bin32\" FOR LOGIN FIX !!

Router Settings: Network / NAT & Port Rules / NAT Settings

DMZ:
If you have DMZ or Virtual Server set your computer as Server: 192.168.2.20 ( Example your Local IP Adress)

Port Rules: Open

TCP: 7777,2106,9014,3306,3316,10241,9021
UDP: 7777,2106,9014,3306,3316,10241,9021 

3.
If you have only a dynamic IP internet connection, you can create a FREE hostname to point to your dynamic IP. One of the most used provider is, No-IP - Dynamic DNS, Static DNS for Your Dynamic IP, but you can choice another as well. Register a new host and don't forget to download and install the update client.

4.
If you wish to play with other in your local network, you must set your Windows "hosts" file as Loop-Back. So here are some setting example:
First of all, you need to setup your "localhost" C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts.
Edit your "hosts" file.

# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# For example:
#
# 102.54.94.97 rhino.acme.com # source server
# 38.25.63.10 x.acme.com # x client host

# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
# ::1 localhost

127.0.0.1 localhost
192.168.2.20 yourhost.no-ip.com # your computer IP

If the game crashes at login, startup your server  create a new connection in Navicat and use port 3316 root as the user and aion as pass, and on aiongs double click, right click Click execute sql file
Browse for AIONEmulator\gameserver\sql\Update
Open abyss_kills_points.sql Hit start close and exit navicat


If you're using english version and getting message "the client's regional code is not compatible with game server"  of aion: browse to C:\Novos_Easy_AionUnique_Emulator_Repack_0.2.1\AIO NEmulator\gameserver\config\main and find gameserver and edit with notepad change line to gameserver.country.code = 1

If you're an idiot and can't follow instructions, don't complain and go do something else.
