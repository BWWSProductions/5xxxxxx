"This album wasnâ€™t what it was intended to be at all," says Eric Clapton. "Itâ€™s actually better than it was meant to be because, in a way, I just let it happen. Itâ€™s an eclectic collection of songs that werenâ€™t really on the mapâ€”and I like it so much because if itâ€™s a surprise to the fans, thatâ€™s only because itâ€™s a surprise to me, as well."

This is the latest Clapton's album released. Most of the songs, if not all, seem to be new, and they pretty much show how good the man still is.
