,Xebecs,2011-04-04T10:12Z,"I always had this blue screen and restart problem with this version, specially when playing media player 9x, one clip that I had would crash my system right away, I thought this was the problem with the media file that I was trying to play. But when I scanned using Avast after a elaborated google search with the blue screen error code I found several false positives (?) in this downloaded folder. I wonder is this false positive is actually a smart fraud perhaps.
Is anyone else having this problem? "
