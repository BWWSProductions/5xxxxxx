Chris Rea Blue Guitars Album 9(Celtic & Irish Blues)(mp3 320 kbs)ICM369
_______________________________________________________________________

Blue Guitars is a Blues album released by Chris Rea on October 14th 2005 
consisting of eleven CDs, one DVD and a full colour book, including paintings 
by the artist, liner notes and song lyrics. 

The album is an ambitious project with the 137 songs recorded over the course 
of 1 1/2 years with a work schedule - according to Chris Rea himself - of 
twelve hours a day, seven days a week.

The collection is the fifth and last release in a line of Blues recordings 
Chris Rea has made since recovering from a serious disease at the turn of the 
millennium and promising himself a return to his Bluesy roots in the event that 
he survived. 

According to Rea "Blue Guitars" will be his last solo effort; however, he will 
continue to release albums as a member of the band "Memphis Fireflies".

Albums

The eleven separate records which comprise "Blue Guitars" could as well stand on 
their own; in combination, however, they provide a journey through the different 
epochs of the Blues, showing the various components that have been added to the 
original African Blues over time, the changes in instrumentation, style, lyrical 
expression and thematic implications. 

Thereby Chris Rea and his band imitate the various styles and lyrical topics, 
creating an instantly recognisable atmosphere on each record, with the first few 
songs usually setting up the direction in which the record is going and then 
developing to various styles within the field of each record.

Album Number Nine - Celtic & Irish Blues
________________________________________

The Blues went in yet another direction, when it started to mingle with Celtic and 
Irish influences, forming still another hybrid. 

The general feeling of sadness, loss and blues, which is inherent in the Irish and 
Celtic roots anyways, together with an all new instrumentation could lay the basis 
for a different kind of approach, giving the Blues the typical Celtic feel.
