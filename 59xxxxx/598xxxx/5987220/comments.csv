,Eejay.Jauregg,2010-11-26T19:50Z,"this must be the first time i come across an upload by eztv that is other than perfect ... woot
don't download, audio is shizzled from 13:55 on."
,callag,2010-11-26T22:49Z,"You're full o'shit Eejay.jauregg, torrent is perfectly good start to finish. Thanks eztv."
,SoloLegions,2010-11-27T20:35Z,"Thanks eztv for bringing misfits to the bay:) Eejay.jauregg is talking crap, quality upload."
,basiltea,2010-11-29T23:02Z,"I'm having the same problem as Eejay... at 13:55 the audio switches to what appears to be Sweeney Todd and commercials. The correct audio picks up where it left off around 19:03, hugely out of sync. Very strange."
,basiltea,2010-11-29T23:57Z,"whoops, that was a different version that was borked. this one's fine. my bad."
,5iTH,2010-12-19T00:43Z,"Yes, you DO appear to be having the same problem as Eejay - you are both suffering from utter shit for brains. Thanks EZTV and thanks to genuine comments."
