â€œHookerâ€™s earliest Riverside albums presented him playing solo acoustic guitar, 
in a conscious effort to direct his work to listeners outside the R&B audience. 

Opinions differ on the matter, but this outing is more interesting than his solo 
acoustic Riverside records, due to the presence of a supporting rhythm section 
on most of the tracks. 

The liner notes (in the fashion of the day) are almost apologetic about this, 
emphasizing that itâ€™s not to create R&B rhythms, but â€œto free Hooker from the 
burden of carrying the full rhythm load.â€ 

To make matters more palatable for the purists, maybe thatâ€™s why a couple of 
jazz players were chosen for the job (bassist Sam Jones and drummer Louis Hayes, 
who formed the rhythm section for Cannonball Adderley at the time). 

Whatâ€™s important is not how pure the music is, but that itâ€™s a decent album, 
striking a good midpoint between his acoustic and electric sound.â€
