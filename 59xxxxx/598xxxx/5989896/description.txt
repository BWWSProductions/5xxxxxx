When a green ogre called Shrek discovers his swamp has been 'swamped' with all sorts of fairytale creatures by the scheming Lord Farquaad, Shrek sets out, with a very loud donkey by his side, to 'persuade' Farquaad to give his swamp back. Instead, a deal is made. Farquaad, who wants to become the King, sends Shrek to rescue Princess Fiona, who is waiting for her one true love. But once they head back with Fiona, it starts to become apparent that not only does Shrek like Fiona, but Fiona is keeping something secret.

A bored and domesticated Shrek pacts with deal-maker Rumpelstiltskin to get back to feeling like a real ogre again, but when he's duped and sent to a twisted version of Far Far Away -- where Rumpelstiltskin is king, ogres are hunted, and he and Fiona have never met -- he sets out to restore his world and reclaim his true love.

2.[u]Far Far Away Idol (2004)[/u]

[img]http://www.thevalueengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/shrek1.jpg[/img]

[b]Plot:[/b]
Far Far Away Idol is an extra in the DVD release based on American Idol and guest starring Simon Cowell. Taking place right after Shrek 2 ends, the plot was that characters from Shrek would sing and dance popular songs at the time, and at the end the viewer gets to pick the winner. However, if any character outside of Shrek, Donkey, Princess Fiona and Puss were selected, Cowell would refuse to accept the winner and proclaim himself the victor, leaping onto a table and performing his "own" rendition of "My Way". This segment was also seen on the ABC airings of the film, between the post-credits scene and the closing credits after. The winner on this airing is Simon Cowell, since there was no way the viewer could interactively pick the winner.
