,sine123,2010-11-26T03:34Z,Works great.
,diablito469,2010-11-26T17:17Z,Thanks for the upload..  Does anyone know how dynamic progress works?   seems like it just puts you at your level but asks you to do quest that you cant get cuz you havent done the prior quests
,thibault73,2010-11-26T18:03Z,You can go into the settings and click on the Dynamic progress tab. Then select skip impossible steps. This will ensure you are not doing quests that required a prior step to do.
,lilneko,2010-11-26T20:53Z,"This definitely works but I'm having a lot of issues (non torrent or uploader related) with zygor since the shattering. Questgivers don't have the quests that Zygor claims they should, or don't have any quests at all. I've updated many times, tried multiple torrents, have dynamic progressed turned on with no luck. I've used Zygor for quite a while so I don't think it's user error.  Anyone else having these issues?"
,lilneko,2010-11-26T20:54Z,Having said that thank you so much to the uploader that shared with us so quickly. =) 
,adsza,2010-11-27T03:11Z,Hey i already download zygor guide a wile back it was 3.3 and this is 2.0 so why did you upload the older version also do you know how i can get the one for cata
,hahalolfailmupp,2010-11-27T04:30Z,"@adsza You dont know the difference between wows version and addons versions, this is 2.0.1521 of the addon, updated for wow 4.0.3a, the guide you refer to is an old guide for 3.3.X"
,diablito469,2010-11-27T05:26Z,@thibault73 -  I did that i have it clicked but the guide doesnt fast forward. then i right click on the down arrow so it can fast forward and it just goes to the next step in the guide.. if it decide to fast forward it send me to a quest that i cant pick up.  Its still a really good guide.. im lvl 48 but the quest its saying to do is for 46 im just doing those quests cuz i dont know if they are for chain quests that ill need later 
,chrixian,2010-11-27T05:35Z,perfect! ty!
,sikler,2010-11-27T10:16Z,This isn't updating for me for some reason It shows the 4.0 version of the game not the guide
,sikler,2010-11-27T10:23Z,I have v2.0.1468 what Am I doing wrong?!!?!
,svetlania09,2010-11-28T15:05Z,"Those of you that are starting this guide with pre-existing characters there will be some difficulty with getting the guide matched up to what you are currently doing.  This main problem is the guide will most likely suggest quests that you haven't done pre-reqs for.  You will have to be patient and wait for future versions of the guide to fix this.  There are about 10,000 new quests since the shattering and we haven't figured out every quest chain in the game."
,xxxkod420xxx,2010-11-29T05:40Z,When are they going to release the 80-85 guide? keep me posted and will you be able to launch it once it goes live? is this already integrated into it because i dont see the guide yet on mine but other then that works perfectly great upload.
,kristie84,2010-12-02T10:29Z,The website says that the 80-85 guide is going to be released with Cataclysm.
,sine123,2010-12-02T14:58Z,6th December for Zygor v3.0

,svetlania09,2010-12-06T16:17Z,"I have my hands on Zygor 3.0.1544 but it isn't a solid release.  Please be patient as there are too many LUA errors for the guide to even load.  Not to mention, in the code there isn't any 80-85 yet and it is still missing Worgen and Goblin zones."
,svetlania09,2010-12-06T16:22Z,3.0.1546 is now available but it is still lacking any updates to the guides such as 80-85.  I will upload as soon as they get updated.
,svetlania09,2010-12-06T18:04Z,"I now have 3.0.1547 uploaded.  It includes 80-85 and goblin and worgen starts.
