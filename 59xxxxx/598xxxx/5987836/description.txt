MOTO - The Movie

The Assignment Inc, a movie picture corporation, and director Taylor Congdon released the trailer and website today of their newest production, MOTO The Movie. Never heard of MOTO? Taylor explains why: â€œWeâ€™ve been keeping this project on the down low for the past year. We were considering a Spring 2010 release and werenâ€™t sure how big the film was going to be. However, the footage captured and the riders weâ€™ve worked with have well exceeded our expectations, and we canâ€™t wait to share it! Currently we've got what it takes to get the movie completed well before the holidays so weâ€™re pulling the trigger and getting it out.â€

From the makers of WHY, TWITCH, OffRoad and 6IX comes a cinematic soaked HighDef journey into the world of riding Dirt Bikes. MOTO is the first film to truly showcase the complete spectrum of dirt bike riding and racing. No MX movie has ever captured so many of the worldâ€™s most progressive riders doing what they do best. From Big Mountain Freeriding, Supercross, OffRoad, Woods, Trials, European Extreme Enduro, FMX, and Motocross, MOTO is the ultimate offâ€road experience!

Featuring Trey Canard, Nathan Woods, Antonio Cairoli, Kyle Summers, Justin Barcia, David Philippaerts, Jessy Nelson, Ryan Villopoto, Mike Mason, Steve Haughelstine, Geoff Aaron, Taddy Blazusiak and many many moreâ€¦
