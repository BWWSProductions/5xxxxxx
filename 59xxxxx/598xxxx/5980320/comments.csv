,razarus_,2010-12-24T17:24Z,"I'm try running.. but, at once(!) send alarm message the my AV and active FW also..
The running file (Windows Loader.exe) included the ""PUP"" application.
The file test, in online scanners also.. The result (43/3; 21/1):  ""Hacktools/PUP"" application. Probably trojan.
I no surprise."

,loki_68,2011-04-01T18:20Z,"I dont understand u People with ur Its a Virus crap. AVG & AVAST ALWAYS SAY CRACKS & HACKTOOLS ARE VIRUSES!
 Get over it, Get a AV that knows better. Yes AVG is a good AV it gets alot but if u wanna download torrents LEARN what false positives are and why they are flagged. 
 DON'T RAG on the Uploader, The Crack is 100% safe, I run Nod32 v4 and Just Activated Win& lastnight No Problems and (Crack) Activator-loader  wasn't even flagged..
Thanx 4 the good work m8.....
