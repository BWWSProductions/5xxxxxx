is it possible for you to give us Captivate for MAC?"
,naranarayan,2011-07-06T19:34Z,"Thethingy, is this really your torrent? It's a virus."
,naranarayan,2011-07-06T19:53Z,This is a virus.
,woofagoo,2011-11-29T22:16Z,If you are going to claim something to be a virus then state how you come to that conclusion. This is not a virus from all testing I have done. If you're basing a claim of being virii from one of the AVs that regularly hit on false positives that is not a conclusion.
