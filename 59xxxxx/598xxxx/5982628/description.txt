Welcome,

My previous major torrent upload effort was the well received "Complete Seagal Pack".

This next movie pack is the result of investigating the Internet for a couple of years, looking for as many good quality Malkovich films as possible.

In 1999, "Being John Malkovich" was the first DVDRip I downloaded.  I was thinking, "Who the fuck is John Malkovich?"

In the movie, he was described as "The Great American Entertainer."  It seemed like disingenuous hot air even though the film blew my mind away, but after watching many of his performances, the aforementioned description is an understatement.

Enjoy these films, for Malkovich is a performance artist of the first order.  From "Places In The Heart" to "Red", enjoy.

It is only missing a few titles because Malkovich has played a lot of roles in some hard to find films.


All the very fucking best,

One-Malkovich-Fan


PS - People helping people, it's beautiful.
