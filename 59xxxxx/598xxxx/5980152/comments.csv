[T],nlx_78,2010-11-24T15:06Z,"Probably all fake/infected torrents:

http://thepiratebay.org/user/_Da_Haka_/

20 uploads in 1 day on high risk programs all having high alot of + instead of - without any comments !!! "
,_Da_Haka_,2010-11-24T18:12Z,"@ nlx_78
All my torrents are legit. Look at the post above your's, proof that this one is legit. Download any of my torrents and if you find anything wrong, tell me. Is it my fault that people don't comment? If they were fakes, you would see comments like ""FAKE!!"" or ""IT GAVE ME A VIRUS!!"". People usually comment if they need help, apparently everyone who downloaded my torrents didn't need help installing because they followed the tutorial that I put in the torrent!! Stop making accusations when you have no proof."
,ultraVert,2010-11-25T06:13Z,"Scanned with AVG and Malwarebytes, it's clean... install and that's it, pre-activated like described.

Your allowed to screenshot in any format, and record as long as you want.

Thank you Da_Haka!"
[T],nlx_78,2010-11-25T16:54Z,"Ok i'm sorry. It was just suspicious because you uploaded like 30 torrents in 2 days, alot of them being the same. I guess i was wrong. Nothing personal, just want this site to be only legit torrents :) Take care"
,_Da_Haka_,2010-11-26T19:56Z,"@nlx_78
It's cool, i see you point. There are a bunch of frauds on this site and you might be suspicious. No hard feelings :) "
,lingnanxiong,2010-11-28T04:30Z,Awesome!.. Thank You very much =D
,hcdoodle,2010-11-28T19:03Z,"Hey for some reason when i go to download this it says:

'This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action. Create an association in the Folder Options cpntrol panel.'

What should i do? I suck at computer stuff :( 

Thanks for the help"
,hcdoodle,2010-11-28T21:05Z,Don't worry it all worked out fine. thanks man!
,AoF,2010-11-30T03:24Z,"Works as stated in the description.

nlx_78 obviously doesn't know what hes talking about considering he is trusted, such a fail."
,KiraValentine32,2010-12-01T12:17Z,"@AoF

being cautious is nothing wrong. this file contains pre-cracked and is not separated from the installer. This can be dangerous because you can't tell what's being installed into your system.

since people here are saying ok. then its ok. no need to bring others down."
,Eleggu,2010-12-02T20:45Z,Thank you! Works perfect! This was really helpful and I will seed for some weeks. Thanks yet once!
,kmd20,2010-12-03T16:15Z,"This will attempt to install Antivirus Action on your system, easy to fix with MBAM and some registry editing, but why bother.  FRAPS does indeed work, but you don't want what comes with it."
,kmd20,2010-12-03T16:34Z,Will Install Antivirus Action on your system as well as FRAPS.  Don't fuck with this.
