The Boomtown Rats Compilation album The Best Of, was first released in Oct 2003 
on Eagle Records with a re-release with new artwork on Universal Records in 
April 2004 and again in February 2005 with yet another new cover. 

The tracks were chosen by the visitors to this website,Boomtownrats.co.uk and 
the Japanese site Banana Republic. 

Bob and Pete were keen that the fans had a say in the listing, the amount of 
votes cast was quite staggering, and it took many hours to compile the final 
list for Bob and Pete to chose from. 

Originally, Hold On Me from In The Long Grass was also included, but at the 
production and mixing stage, one track had to go. 

Released to coincide with the re-issue of all six of the Rats' albums - all 
remastered and with previously unavailable bonus tracks - this Best Of package 
is a timely reminder of what a great band this six piece from the wrong side of 
Dublin actually were.

Bursting onto a London music scene dominated by punk acts in the late 1970s, the 
Rats had the attitude and the look to fit in alright, but they differed from their 
safety pin-bedecked colleagues in one vital respect; they had great songs. 

Tunes such as Joey's On The Street Again & the band's first UK number one Rat Trap 
are plaintive, almost Springsteen-esque cries from the heart about the plight of 
working class youth, while I Don't Like Mondays, the Rats' second chart topping 
single inspired by the story of a US schoolgirl shooting dead several of her 
classmates simply to brighten up the first day of the week, showed frontman 
Bob Geldof's observational skills were not restricted to detailing life on the 
housing estates of north Dublin.

It's ironic too that the Rats' first hit, Looking After No. 1, naturally featured 
here, was to be the last song the band ever played live, in Dublin, 1986; a song 
about pure self-interest, sung by the man then - as now - admired around the world 
for launching the most famous charity project ever seen.
