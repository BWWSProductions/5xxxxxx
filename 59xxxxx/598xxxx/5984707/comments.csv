,Killjoy88,2010-11-25T15:34Z,"+1 for Cougar Town!

Twentyforty, do you have any advice regarding yourself and Peerblock?  Many thanks!"
,coolasad,2010-11-25T16:43Z,Cool
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-25T16:58Z,"@Killjoy88: Double-click on PB icon in systray, in list of blocked contacts find Range OVH SIS and right-click and ""Allow permanently"" my address (which is blocked range since August) 91.121.1.144. Press few times Stop - Start buttons in your torrent client and in uTorrent check if my BitTornado appears or not. If not - something else is wrong or your ISP blocks this range too - then you're screwed by."
,redriding,2010-11-25T17:46Z,Thanks for Modern Family
,lilars26,2010-11-25T18:32Z,"Thanks 20-40.Modern Family is one of the funnier shows to come along in some time.

NOTE: TimeToLive 48h (torrent's TTL)Can someone please tell me what this means?"
,ppravin88,2010-11-25T18:33Z,"@20-40:
dude..any updates on the documentary list that i requested..? (just curious!) "
,skillet92,2010-11-25T18:43Z,@lilars26:It means after 48 hrs 20-40 stops seeding the torrent!
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-25T19:12Z,"@lilars: I could try. ""TimeToLive 48h"" is common practice on good private tracker sites and tells for how long torrent would be seeded from main seeding server. After ""expiration"" time some sites automatically delete such tagged torrents - knowing that there is no point in longer seeding.

That's true here too, If anyone misses some show for TWO days, this is not a right place to look for.

Anyway, downloader still have a chance here at Sunday's Weekly TV packs. Last one was kept active for four days - and if anyone haven't downloaded in six frikkin days - I humbly suggest to go someplace else.

I have really small disk quota on server (20 GB) and it must be done."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-25T19:18Z,"@ppravin88:  I haven't answered because I was pissed by many requests placed dozen lines below my:
""REQUESTS ARE FROZEN"".

Send me an e-mail and I would look into."
,lilars26,2010-11-25T21:04Z,"@skillet92 and 20-40
Thank you both.I had no clue.I thought it was refering to some new Eddie Murphy movie that was coming out.;)"
,ppravin88,2010-11-25T22:09Z,"@20-40:
and what would be your email id..?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-26T07:01Z,"@ppravin88: My e-mail is in any long header last two months.
I have no clue why you try to sound like newbie here.
You REALLY READ NOTHING I WROTE, and expect from me to read your request? Isn't that stupid?"
,rojenatgmail,2010-11-26T14:32Z,Thanks for Human Target
,DMVIN,2010-11-26T15:19Z,thanks for human target
,ppravin88,2010-11-26T15:33Z,"@20-40:
