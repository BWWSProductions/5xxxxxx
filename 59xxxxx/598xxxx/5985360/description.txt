ISOLATED DRUMS / DRUM LOOPS / ISOLATED GUITAR/BASS / ISOLATED PIANO/SYNTH
SYNTH LOOPS / ISOLATED VOCAL TRACKS

Almost all tracks extracted from original recordings, the drum loops and synth loops
I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve also extracted taken from original recordings, it took me awhile with all the editing but was worth the effort, i put these on my mp3 player and can use them anywhere theres an amp or stereo, most are eq\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ed and ready for any live band or jamming, you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d be surprised how many hit songs use these drum and synth loops in the background.

Some of these are experimental, i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve included Audacity for your own editing.

**If using in a Band plug the output into a VOLUME PEDAL then into a PA AMP or Keyboard Amp to be dynamic, make sure the drummer can hear the tracks also, good to have it through a monitor for live playing**

I play in a 3 piece band and i tell you when i start the percussion or synth loops when playing live the dance floor packs up, the band is amazed how dynamic our symphonic power trio band is now.
Have fun
