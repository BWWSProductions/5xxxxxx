Investigation which uncovers disturbing evidence that some Muslim children are
being exposed to extremist preachers and fundamentalist Islamic groups. We also

why school inspectors have missed the warning signs and examines the impact this
could have on young Muslims' ability to integrate into mainstreamlife.
