Petra is a music group regarded as a pioneer of the Christian rock and contemporary Christian music genres.
Formed in 1972, the band took its name from the Greek word for "rock." Though formally disbanding in 2005,
incarnations of Petra have played reunion shows in the years since and plan an album in fall 2010.
