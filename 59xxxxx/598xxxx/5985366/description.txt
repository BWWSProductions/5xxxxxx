Let 3 - Jedina

Let 3 (Flight 3) is a modern rock band from Rijeka, Croatia formed in 1987.
The band frontmen are Damir \\\"Mrle\\\" MartinoviÃ„â€¡ and Zoran \\\"Prlja\\\" ProdanoviÃ„â€¡.
The band is popular in Croatia and other former Yugoslav republics due to
their original approach to rock music and their obscene live performances.
Sometimes provocative and vulgar lyrics and always shocking live performance
with lots of nudity often polarise Croatian public.

Let 3 often change their lineup. Current lineup is:

    * Damir MartinoviÃ„â€¡ (Mrle) - bass guitar, effects, vocals
    * Zoran ProdanoviÃ„â€¡ (Prlja) - vocals
    * Ivan Ã…Â arar (Faf) - keyboards, programming, samples
    * Branko KovaÃ„ÂiÃ„â€¡ (Husta) - drums, percussion
    * DraÃ…Â¾en Baljak (Baljak) - guitar, mandolin
    * Matej Zec (Knki) - guitar
    * Kornelije Duras (Korni) - keyboards
