,jackal2486,2010-11-25T20:41Z,Are people just commenting on a sample from the first 36 minutes because everyone knows that's the best quality already
,jackal2486,2010-11-25T20:51Z,I just checked out the sample. It's very....green. It sounds like someone's ruffling to the side of the camera as well. This probably isn't worth downloading...
,harrynuttsack,2010-11-25T21:00Z,this is the same shitty copy with the timer on the bottom.the russian copy is the best so far just have to fix audio but this one sucks....and to dark v4 a5
,Zaaki5,2010-11-26T11:34Z,Hey okay so im new at this so how do i become a seeder
,GodspeedX,2010-11-26T19:10Z,"It's ok..  at 54 minutes in, it gets SUPER dark and you can't really see anything unless it's very well lit in the movie.  It get's a little better as the movie progresses, but the 2nd half is very very dark.  The sound goes out of sync for 10 or 15 seconds but then fixes itself a couple times throughout the movie.  The first 54 minutes look great, but after that it gets very dark.

I still finished watching it, but it was difficult to tell what was going on during a few parts in the last 1/4th of the movie."
,Plotaven,2010-11-27T00:30Z,So is there the 36min syndrome on this one 2 ?
,GodspeedX,2010-11-27T02:58Z,"No, not the 36 min syndrome..  it looks great for a cam up until 54 minutes and then it get's really dark.  It sorta lightens up as the movie goes on.  There are a few parts where you can't see jack, but at no point do you get lost."
