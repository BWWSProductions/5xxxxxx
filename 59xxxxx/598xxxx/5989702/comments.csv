[T],geogaddi000,2010-11-27T23:04Z,It's 90% English with a few clips of Alejandro's films in.. another language.  No subs necessary.

,c3bhm,2010-12-13T22:38Z,"This is NOT the 2010 documentary ""2012 - Time for Change"".  This is an hour long interview experience w/ Jodorowsky. "
,number0,2011-01-20T00:19Z,"well well. I downloaded the torrent and it indeed was the correct documentary. My friend did the same and it wasn't, it was that some interview. How is it possible? is it possible? (seems to be)"
,neil802,2011-03-20T16:27Z,"Oddly enough, there are two films with the title _2012: time for change_  This one (thank you geogaddi000), and another one.

The other one is this:

2012: Time for Change
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1506940   2010
It begins with an animation of creation of the world, and runs about 1:25  Does anyone out there have it?
