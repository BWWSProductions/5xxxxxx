,osriccc,2010-12-09T03:48Z,3Li rips are the best. Clean and great quality.
,GawtPawned,2010-12-15T16:50Z,"Has the Cinavia watermark (mutes audio), if you are planning to watch on PS3, do NOT bother downloading. Thanks for the great movie though deffjam!"
,jrgray6,2010-12-18T21:59Z,"Same as what GotPawned said... audio is watermarked.  Won't play on ps3 :(

Thanks for the upload

V/9
A/9 (first 10 minutes) then got muted!"
,pivmouse,2010-12-23T10:53Z,"Solution to PS3 Playback:
you can play cinavia protected movies on your ps3 slim. you just have to change a couple settings. in sound settings, select audio output settings, then switch from hdmi to optical digital, (even if you use hdmi), then select every setting there is, then save it. once its saved, it will take you back to sound settings, then select audio multi-output and turn it on. it makes the sound a bit lower, but at least you can hear the whole movie"
,imakewebs,2011-01-01T15:24Z,pivmouse is CORRECT.  The video got muted.  I stopped the video on my PS3.  I then went to audio settings (I have optical).  I switched everything to HDMI and exited the menu.  Then I went back and switched everything back to optical and it worked just fine.  It actually did it TWICE in the movie and I did the switch-a-roo twice and it never interrupted me again.  Awesome movie.  It is the funny movie I have seen in a LONG time; Will Ferrell is back.
,Basnagus,2011-01-01T23:11Z,excellent!! A/V - 10 .. thnx

,xmilkman7,2011-09-16T01:16Z,"Downloaded at a solid 1.1MB speed, audio and such isn't a problem for computers, only PS3's I presume, so don't worry about that. Great torrent and thanks. SEED because everyone else deserves the download speed that you get!! Thanks deffjam! Happy trails all :)"
