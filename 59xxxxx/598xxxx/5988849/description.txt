NYPD Detectives Christopher Danson and P.K. Highsmith (Dwayne Johnson and
Samuel L. Jackson) are the baddest and most beloved cops in New York City.
They don't get tattoos - other men get tattoos of them. Two desks over and
one back, sit Detectives Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz
(Mark Wahlberg). You've seen them in the background of photos of Danson
and Highsmith, out of focus and eyes closed. They're not heroes - they're
"the Other Guys." But every cop has his or her day and soon Gamble and Hoitz
stumble into a seemingly innocuous case no other detective wants to touch
that could turn into New York City's biggest crime. It's the opportunity of
their lives, but do these guys have the right stuff?
