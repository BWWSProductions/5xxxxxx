Needs a PROPER."
,Mr.Mental,2010-11-26T02:31Z,quality is about the same but the sounds are screwed in this one aswell... 2 worthless downloads :(
,VYCanisMajoris,2010-11-26T02:52Z,Thats a dam joke. Why are people seeding this please stop. 
,coheedvscambria,2010-11-26T07:33Z,people are seeding it because they are like me.. i didnt read the comments before i downloaded it.  i am very dissapointed that the audio is screwed up.. and that it is at probably one of the more important parts of the episode. we dont get this channel in the states so this is my only way to watch it.
,Hagec,2010-11-26T08:11Z,there is proper ...but on private tracker by some guy called hanibal ...i found links .....but one more link needs to be uploaded....then i will post it there
