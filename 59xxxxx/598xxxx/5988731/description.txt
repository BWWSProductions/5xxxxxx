Just what will motoring be like in a post-apocalyptic world thatâ€™s been blown to bits by nuclear bombs or a massive comet? Itâ€™s a burning question thatâ€™s on literally nobodyâ€™s mind, and we give you all the answers in this brand new, incredibly cheerful Top Gear DVD Embarking on a terrifying journey into the future, we show you how to drive to work in the perpetual darkness of a Nuclear Winter, how to make motorsport exciting when thereâ€™s only two racing drivers left alive, and, in a world where all cars are bristling with weapons, how to survive the savage, explosive fury of a Doomsday M.O.T test.
