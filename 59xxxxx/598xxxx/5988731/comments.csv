,nivek retals,2010-11-27T15:45Z,sound out of sync !!!
,Rizlakingsize,2010-11-27T18:30Z,use vlc player then ;-p
,detlort,2010-11-27T20:10Z,"out of sync for me - even when using vlc.
If your player has ""audio time shift"" (I use Media player Classic Homecinema) you can adjust it. add about 150ms. "
,detlort,2010-11-27T20:17Z,vlc can do it to ;o)
,Windrider1345,2010-11-27T22:17Z,An Audio time shift of 280 is perfect on Media Player Classic to fix the out of sync audio. 
,haladriel,2010-11-28T01:55Z,imdb link?
,Okkenbom2,2010-11-28T12:04Z,"Audio out of sync. Quite annoying when trying to play it on my ps3. Anyone know of any ""audio time shift"" on ps3? "
,kndrbiff,2010-11-28T14:07Z,How do you get it to work in VLC the audio delay is kinda annoying??
[V],.BONE.,2010-11-28T14:32Z,use VirtualDub direct select direct stream copy on audio and video go then in2 audio select interleaveing... delay audio track by 400ms ok then save avi as wait 5 mins then job done :)
,Gjallarhorn,2010-11-28T16:09Z,"Its more like 450ms, can also be done directly in vlc."
,soupcip,2010-11-28T19:06Z,"The audio was easily fixed, indeed 300/400 ms does the trick, but : this is the most boring top gear performance ever. pffff I am a big fan but really didnt't like this. very dull."
,haladriel,2010-11-29T00:18Z,any imdb link?
,Mulreay,2010-11-29T15:35Z,Audio is out of sync. If you use VLC player then change the audio to +0.400 and that seems to be synced. Apart from that good quality A9 V9 also downloaded at 5.2mb/s which was nice. Thanks for the up.
,captain71pugwash,2010-11-29T18:34Z,"Video is fine, but audio out of sync.. looks a pile of pish anyway, but thanks for the upload"
,2FnFast,2010-11-29T22:46Z,"Nothing to see here folks, bad rip, move along, I'll keep checking for a quality upload and report back"
,2FnFast,2010-11-30T05:42Z,"this one worked great for me, no audio lag, D/L was slower than usual, topped out at around 300kb/s while I can usually hit at least a Meg if not 2

,ksevrakwtos,2010-11-30T21:09Z,"i will have to agree with my mate soupcip. This is very boring. I am a big fun of Top Gear, but this is not Top Gear, and that's mainly because Clarkson is missing. Download only if you collect every top gear specials, otherwise don't bother"
,thesoul1987,2010-12-01T20:28Z,thanx dude
,golapk,2010-12-12T05:33Z,"Agree, audio shift of around 450ms is perfect, can be done wih VLC"
,golapk,2010-12-12T05:35Z,Agree. Audio shift of around 400-450ms is perfect
,edd4004,2011-01-26T17:42Z,"It's fair enough saying to people to use this, use that... Some people just wanna d/l a film and watch it, not spend however long fucking about downloading different types of software to adjust the sound x picture etc. Then you're really just wasting the time of others.
To make this comment more simple, WHY CAN'T YOU JUST UPLOAD A DECENT QUALITY SYNCED COPY, OR DON'T BOTHER AT ALL!!"
,Dominos1000,2011-03-03T14:20Z,"im new to this, so you go 
VLC
Tools/effects&filters/sync
then + 300 to 450ms?
or - 300 to 450ms?"
