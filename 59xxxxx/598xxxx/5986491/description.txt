The legendarypunk-metal trio team up with EMI for this, astonishingly their twentieth studio album and the follow-up to 2008's 'Motorizer'. You know exactly what you are going to get when you buy a Motorhead album and on this release Lemmy and the boys do not disappoint as they turn in yetanother massive slab of turbocharged rock 'n' roll replete with chugging riffs, battering drums and Lemmy's trademark bleach-gargling vocals.
