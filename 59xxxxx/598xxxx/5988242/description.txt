Okay, now that I'm done ripping their Wiki and copying their poetry about themselves, I was you to know this stuff:

1. Most of these songs are 128 kbps, MP3 only. 
2. If it's My Chemical Romance, it's in this torrent. The Live and Rare shit. Their song with The Used (Under Pressure, originally by Queen). The plethora of everything else that they have ever made. Some demos. Their Bob Dylan cover that was on the Watchmen soundtrack. Just everything.
