In order to save his wife from prison, John consults Damon Pennington (Liam Neeson), a hardened criminal who has successfully escaped from prison many times, and who has even written a book about the art of escaping from prisons. Damon becomes the mentor of the husband, and encourages him to study the prison because "any prison has a key". Damon also warns him that escaping from the prison is the easy part, and that he must be very resourceful and figure out how to avoid getting caught after the escape, and that he must obtain false passports, new social security numbers, and a "truckload of cash" to survive after the escape. Damon explains that even if John uses cash to pay for the rental getaway car, he would still have to have a fake social security number for reference. He also suggests going to an unstable foreign country that is politically hostile to the United States, so that there would be no extradition or any possibility of finding them. The escape expert also informs John that within only 15 minutes after the escape the police will have already blocked many of the nearby roads, and that within 35 minutes there will be descriptions of them even if their photos are yet not posted at every train station, but that it might take more minutes for airports to receive their digital photos.
