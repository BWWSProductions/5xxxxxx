    Wallace and Gromit experience the world through the        
    five senses, exploring the fact and fiction behind        
    invisibility cloaks, bomb-detecting bees and the top     
    sensory inventions.                                       
                                                               
    In London, scientists are creating prototype              
    invisibility cloaks using metamaterials to bend light    
    around objects, and we discover the science behind new    
    technology allowing the blind to 'see' through taste       
    using hi-tech sunglasses.                                 
    In Kentucky, USA we visit the small town where a local   
    farmer invented wireless telephones over 100 years ago.   
    Or did he? Finally in Tasmania, we meet our Inventor of    
    the Week who, after being told it was impossible,         
    invented and made his own unique prosthetic arm.
