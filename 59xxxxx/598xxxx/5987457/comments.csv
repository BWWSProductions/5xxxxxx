,PERFECTSHOT,2011-07-21T05:33Z,Just want to confirm that this Limewire 5.6.2 (Prirate Edition) is working perfectly as a normal Limewire Pro version. You will just need to restart your system after you finish installing in order for the Lime to be connected to the network. To those who has been searching for a working limewire. This is the version you are looking for. RAMZTEC
,PERFECTSHOT,2011-07-21T11:09Z,You will also need to install Java(TM) SE Runtime Eviroment 6.0 Update 26 for this Lime to work.
