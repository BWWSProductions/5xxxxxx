Bill Haley (July 6, 1925 â€“ February 9, 1981) was one of the first American
rock and roll musicians and he is credited by many with first popularizing
this form of music in the early 1950swith his group Bill Haley & His Comets
and their hit song Rock Around the Clock.

Bobby Day (July 1, 1928 - July 27, 1990), was an early African American rock
and roll and R&B musician, born Robert James Byrd, (making him Bobby Byrd - not
to be confused with the funk musician/Famous Flames member of the same name),
in Fort Worth, Texas, he moved to Los Angeles, California at the age of fifteen.
As a member of the R&B group, The Hollywood Flames, he used the stage name
Bobby Day to perform and record.

He went several years with minor musical success limited to the West Coast,
including being the original "Bob" in the duo Bob & Earl. In 1957, Day formed
his own band called the "Satellites" following which he recorded three songs
that are seen today as rock and roll classics.

Days best songwriting efforts were Over and Over made popular by the Dave Clark
Five in 1965 and "Little Bitty Pretty One" popularized by Thurston Harris in 1957,
Clyde McPhatter in 1962 and the Jackson Five in 1972. However, Day is most
remembered for his 1958 solo recording of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 2 hit,
"Rockin' Robin", written by Leon Rene under the pseudonym Jimmie Thomas.

It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc."Rockin' Robin"

1964, Gene Vincent in 1969, Michael Jackson in 1972, and by McFly in 2006.

Sometimes referred to as a one-hit wonder, because despite numerous recordings
with a variety of record label, apart from "Rockin' Robin", Day never achieved
another Top 40 hit.

Day died of cancer in 1990, and was buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City,
California.

His best known song is Blue Suede Shoes according to Charlie Daniels, Carl Perkins
songs personified the rockabilly era, and Carl Perkins' sound personifies the
rockabilly sound more so than anybody involved in it, because he never changed."

Perkins songs were recorded by artists(and friends) as influential as Elvis Presley,
The Beatles, and Johnny Cash, which further cemented his place in the history of
popular music.
