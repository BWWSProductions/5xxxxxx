________________________________________________________________

Blue Guitars is a Blues album released by Chris Rea on October 14th 2005 
consisting of eleven CDs, one DVD and a full colour book, including paintings 
by the artist, liner notes and song lyrics. 

The album is an ambitious project with the 137 songs recorded over the course 
of 1 1/2 years with a work schedule - according to Chris Rea himself - of 
twelve hours a day, seven days a week.

The collection is the fifth and last release in a line of Blues recordings 
Chris Rea has made since recovering from a serious disease at the turn of the 
millennium and promising himself a return to his Bluesy roots in the event that 
he survived. 

According to Rea "Blue Guitars" will be his last solo effort; however, he will 
continue to release albums as a member of the band "Memphis Fireflies".

Albums

The eleven separate records which comprise "Blue Guitars" could as well stand on 
their own; in combination, however, they provide a journey through the different 
epochs of the Blues, showing the various components that have been added to the 
original African Blues over time, the changes in instrumentation, style, lyrical 
expression and thematic implications. 

Thereby Chris Rea and his band imitate the various styles and lyrical topics, 
creating an instantly recognisable atmosphere on each record, with the first few 
songs usually setting up the direction in which the record is going and then 
developing to various styles within the field of each record.

Album Number Six - Chicago Blues
________________________________

Again it was movement that was pushing the Blues into a new direction, movement 
upwards North to Chicago in the pursuit of jobs and a new life. People suddenly 
found themselves in a completely different situation and this instantly influenced 
the Blues, the electric style, developed earlier on in Electric Memphis and Texas 
Blues, remained, however became harder and edgier, instruments like the saxophone 
were incorporated into the music and gave this new hybrid a sometimes jazzy feel. 

Once again, the lyric themes shifted away from known territory and began to reflect 
the changed situation, drugs, alcohol, sex, women, money gained major importance, 
life in wintery ghettos and anonymous housing schemes contributed its share: Chicago 
Blues was born.
