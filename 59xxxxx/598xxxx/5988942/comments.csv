,parkcentral,2011-10-09T13:40Z,"I agree that the recording quality could have been better (especially the first track). It appears that all sources have this problem, which leads me to believe that the original recording levels at the studio were not properly monitored and adjusted.

All songs are near distorting, but all songs besides track one are still perfectly enjoyable.

Perhaps on her next album miss Obel will contract some better sound engineers."

If youre expecting good soundquality, then DONT download this piece of crap!"
