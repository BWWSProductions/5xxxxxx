,masterfaster2,2010-11-26T16:01Z,english version please :)
,mindgrind,2010-11-26T16:42Z,The english version of this update would be great  :)
,masterfaster2,2010-11-26T17:16Z,"The cracked exe has  neutral language, so maybe it will also work for the english update."
,mapel110,2010-11-26T19:12Z,Doesn't work here with the multi language Version(non-RUS). Exe crashes at start.
,masterfaster2,2010-11-26T19:18Z,"Nope, It doesn't work for the english version"
,Insomneac,2010-11-26T20:42Z,"You can just use the v1.0 crack with the v1.1 patch.

I used Reloaded's and it worked fine (game starts anyway)."
,cirios8300,2010-11-26T23:04Z,i see no performance gain with this update
,masterfaster2,2010-11-26T23:46Z,"you should use the english crack 1.0 with the english update 1.1.0 

the arcania.exe is updated to 1.1.0 and includes the new optimizations. 

thus there is not logic to replace it with the old crack"
,masterfaster2,2010-11-27T00:12Z,"typing error:

you should not use the english crack 1.0 with the english update 1.1.0 "
,NanoEntity,2010-11-27T02:02Z,"this is useless update, only RUS?"
,NanoEntity,2010-11-27T02:04Z,"oh and

Update 1.1.0 is arcania.exe, it only updates the EXE

Putting 1.0 exe over 1.1.0 removes the update lol, stupid people.
"
,Insomneac,2010-11-27T22:24Z,"To the people saying that Patch v1.1 only updates the exe, it doesn't.

It adds several *.pak files.

I'm talking about Patch #2 ""ArcaniA_Gothic4_Patch_Installer_EFIGS.exe"" and not the Performance Hotfix ""SGS4BC6.EXE"", which just installs an exe only and so cracking would be pointless.

Before writing people off as wrong or stupid, check first."
,masterfaster2,2010-11-27T23:51Z,"none said that it updates only the exe, read careful the comments.

you may use the inno setup unpacker  to unpack the setup (that's what I did - use the ""innounp -x setup.exe"")

I'm trying to apply the patched bytes from the russian cracked exe by TRiViUM to the english exe, unfortunately I had no luck till now (I have limited knowledge in that matter)."
,Insomneac,2010-11-28T01:44Z,"Read the comments again, NanoEntity said it only updated the exe.

He confused it with the performance Hotfix, then had the nerve to call others stupid.

Bottom line is, you can simply use the v1.0 Trivium or Reloaded crack with the patch until something better comes up, if it ever does."
,masterfaster2,2010-11-28T01:56Z,"it seems thepiratebay is falling apart. (not all comments are visible, many new vip users that upload fakes etc. etc.)"
,masterfaster2,2010-11-28T02:05Z,"@Insomneac you may have right about the first, but using the older crack with the update has no effect (the 2 new new files of the update remain unused by the 1.0 exe).
