,ebthnew,2011-01-02T05:03Z,"do you have the extras/special features that come with the blu-ray disc (ie. behind the scenes, interviews etc.)--if so can you upload them?  I've been trying to find them for months and I don't have a blu-ray player so even if I buy the blu-ray I can't watch them...(the dvd doesn't have the special features on this release)"
