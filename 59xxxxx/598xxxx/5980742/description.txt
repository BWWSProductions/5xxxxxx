Video = 24 fps 1280 x 736 MPEG-4 AVC x.264

Audio = 224 kbps .ac3 @ 48 KHz from Explicit CD Audio source which replaced original audio

Special thanks to JB59 for the original and great uploaded .avi. (We seem to be becoming a team on these Rihanna rips lol. :-) )

I have done many special personal tricks here to increase quality from the original. Check it, you will enjoy!

Plus, the video card you have can now accelerate the video, for all of you with slower cpus. (Use PowerDVD or Media Player Home Cinema.)

IVTC (inverse telecine), de-blocking, sharpening, black bars cropped and other things applied. Aspect ratio remains true to original, of course. No stretching at all.

Video is as is in the screen shot. No cropping done to that at all compared to the vid release here. All in all, a proper encode and looks fantastic!

Enjoy!
