,jackalope77,2010-11-29T02:53Z,"If I could figure out how to keep the menus or just one menu i would consider it, but when i use DVDShrink to re-author, if i try and add the menus it says they will be non-functional so makes sense just to lose them.  It used to bother me, but then i realized i just use the remote to switch audio/subtitle anyway, i never go back to the menu.  Plus i love how these discs go right to the movie as soon as you put it in the player.  Also, just to be clear I am not applying any compression whatsoever to the main movie, all im doing is removing everything else.  For example my next upload is ready to go and it will be 5-6gb, so the user can decide whether to compress or not, but 1-2gb are cut out so it saves upload/download time.  Appreciate the input."
,keleieke,2010-12-04T06:03Z,"No body's commenting about jackalope's new experiment.  I think it's a good idea.  I like the main menu in that it lets me get to the subs, audio formats, and sometimes chapters more easily...  The real DVD remote is somewhere and the multi remote I use isn't full function.  But do any way you want is still ok wit me.  Those things always say ""will be non-functional"", ie: click on a trailer and nothing happens, but the functions I mentioned earlier are still accessible.  Don't know DVDShrink, but another one I've seen has a check box ""Keep Menu"".    After stripping the unnecessary's, you're picking DVD9 (the max size possible) so no compression occurs...  that's interesting.  I still vote to compress if you're going through the stripping anyway.  I don't know how to djfred compress so your tool is as good as any.  This is when the peeps should chime in.   "

Thats what I was hoping, but everyone seems to just hit it and quit it these days without so much as a thanku, nevermind an useful dvd authoring tip.  I always want to hear about better ways to encode, so if you are in the know, then comment!"
