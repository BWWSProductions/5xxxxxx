IMPORTANT NOTE: I HAVE CHANGED MY UPLOAD FORMAT.  FOR MUCH FASTER UPLOADS AND DOWNLOADS, INSTEAD OF UPLOADING UNTOUCHED DVD9'S, I AM NOW STRIPPING EVERYTHING BUT THE MAIN MOVIE (UNLESS THERE'S SOME REALLY AMAZING SPECIAL FEATURES, WHICH THERE USUALLY AREN'T). THE END PRODUCT IS THE SAME TYPE OF FILES, ENCODE WITH DVDSHRINK OR WHATEVER AS USUAL.  FOR EXAMPLE, WITH THIS RELEASE I WAS ABLE TO CUT OUT MORE THAN 3gb OF MATERIAL AND STILL KEEP THE VIDEO QUALITY AT 100% WITHOUT REMOVING ANY AUDIO OR SUBTITLE STREAMS.  PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COMMENT ON THE NEW FORMAT IF YOU HAVE AN OPINION.  I THINK THAT SACRIFICING MENUS AND CRAPPY FEATURES IS WORTH IT FOR MAX QUALITY VIDEO ON A BLANK DVD5.

Greetings to all my fellow TPB users.  I am going to make an effort to upload dvds that I had a hard time finding, or ones that I just think are really cool, lol.  I hope you enjoy them.

Remember, please SEED as long as you can after downloading!!!!
