Based on the comic series of the same name, Young Justice will follow the 

adventures of the teenage superhero sidekicks Aqualad (the team leader, 

approximately age 15 or 16), Robin (age 13), Kid Flash (age 15), Superboy 

(age 16 weeks), Miss Martian (age 16 in Martian years), and Artemis (age 

15), who have finally gained independence from their leaders and the privelege 

to start their own team (when the Justice League begins to experience 

difficulty avoiding the spotlight, and Batman decides a cover operations team 

is needed). Set in Earth 16, the show will focus on the heroes trying to see if 

they have what it takes to use their powers for good (without the aid and 

guidance of their leaders) while trying to overcome typical problems that come 

with a teenage personal life at the same time.
