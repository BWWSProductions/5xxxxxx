,Bakerman2807,2010-11-25T09:46Z,Issue #4 all pages are jpeg except page 3 which is a pdf. Makes it a bit hard to read on screen.

,ulyssesk,2010-11-26T00:53Z,"from demonoid:

""i was able to view these using gonvisor, i had to tweak these files a bit though, or miss out reading the page 3s of issues 2,3,4.

i did it by opening the .cbz files with winrar, deleted the __MACOSX directory, converted the .pdf page (page 3 of issue #s 2, 3 & 4) to .jpg, then it opens fine in gonvisor, but for some reason it wont open in cdisplay, you may have to extract and re-archive.

this is the only place where one can get issue # 4 for now..."""
