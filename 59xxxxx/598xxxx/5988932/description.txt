Mark Corby, the celebrated military historian, turns his attention to one of the great military geniuses of all time; Spartacus.

A man from humble origins who went on to defeat the might of Rome, not once but several times. He led his slave army to freedom but then inexplicably turned back to go once again into the jaws of the lion.

How was this man and his rag-bag army of slaves and other outcasts able to withstand the might of Rome for so long given that they had so many disadvantages to overcome?

Mark Corby delves into this mystery and explains how the reality of Spartacus' achievements were far greater than any hollywood film or third rate television series could possibly portray.
