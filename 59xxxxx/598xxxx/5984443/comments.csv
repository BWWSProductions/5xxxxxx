,PirateJFK,2010-11-26T01:58Z,now under applications>mac
,maikypr,2010-11-26T06:32Z,How come if the OS is 4.46 a DUAL LAYER DVD is needed??? and Also I'm downloading from a Windows 7 OS I can't burn it using Image Burn doesn't it have to be from a MAC OS to burn for it to work???  Thanks
,PirateJFK,2010-11-26T18:23Z,"Opps!
No dual layer required.
This is the applications dvd after installing the os for apps like garageband, iphoto, etc.
if your looking for the os you will need a hackintosh copy if installing on a windows machine.
just do a google search for ""hackintosh"" a normal copy of mac os x will not do the trick
but if you are still looking for the os 
heres the link

,PirateJFK,2010-11-27T10:23Z,"MacBook Pro MC024LL
i7

I've tested with the old white intel macbook (apps and os disc) and ppc g5 (only the apps disc, due to processor) and all works fine."
,Wendy Whoppers,2010-11-28T01:24Z,thx great!
