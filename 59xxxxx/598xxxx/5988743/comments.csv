,honda_95,2010-11-27T15:15Z,for me the game turn off and ask if I should send the report to microsoft or not? someone who has the same problem?
,honda_95,2010-11-27T15:20Z,for me it shut off and ask if I should send the report to microsoft or not? someone who has the same problem?
,axero,2010-11-27T15:53Z,"Doesn't work for me, fails then says check your hardware is sufficient.

My hardware is more than sufficient. I hav updated everything driver wise and dx wise. People who ahve bought this game on steam are having the same problem. Tried uninst and reinst, and game still won't load."
,axero,2010-11-27T16:10Z,"Nvmd, got it to work by starting the game then pressing ctrl alt del and it worked..

WTF"

un?"
,NSRacer,2010-11-28T11:12Z,"i have the same ""send error report"" fucked up problem...HELP PLEASE !!!"
,kab76,2010-11-28T13:01Z,"IF THE GAME CRASH TRY THIS:

1 Go THQ->Mx Vs Atv Reflex->Installers
2 RUN DXSETUP.exe"
,NSRacer,2010-11-28T14:58Z,i think hte OS might be the problem because all the guys who confirmed that the game is running have vista or windows 7
,axero,2010-11-28T15:07Z,"Seriously, this game is just a fucking mess. It barely starts for anyone. 

Like i say, mine wasn't starting, and now every time I dbl click the shortcut or exe, as soon as i've done that, I have to hit ctrl-alt-del, then cancel out of task manager, and it miraculously starts. I have to do that every time I want to start the game.

Fucking wank."
,Vlad5800,2010-11-28T18:21Z,for me this don't work ctrl-alt-del

,four09,2010-12-13T07:51Z,"Works, but there's crazy frame issues that need to be fixed. Any updates for this game would be nice, but I fear they won't be released here."
,megodtoo,2010-12-13T15:51Z,"Any one that is have trouble ""cannot run missing d3dx9.43.dll"" Direct X needs updating. Go to the directory  Program Files (x86)\THQ\MX vs ATV Reflex\Installers and double click on DXSETUP.exe
It should now update and will run.
Mine had same error till I updated with instruction above.
Good luck"

1. INSTALL STEAM

3. GO TO ""ADD A NON STEAM GAME""
4. ADD BOTH THE SETTING EXE AND GAME EXE
5. GO TO YOUR GAME LIST IN STEAM AND LOOK FOR MX VS ATV, HIT PLAY, ENJOY!!"

,v7DusK,2012-04-15T18:21Z,"Great Game!                (Win7 32bit)
Keep balance on bikes with right stick on gamepad. Pull back on right stick on the face of a jump to ""stretch"" your distance in mid air. 
Only drawback is a never ending cramp in the right hand! 
I have played nearly the whole game, this is MX Unleashed on STEROIDS!"
