,dinodig,2011-01-05T02:39Z,"I had Little Snitch 2.2.4 installed before this and was registered with the serial given on this site and had blocked UI agent and everything was going well.

 Then I installed 2.3.3 version and it upgraded taking the old key as a valid one.

 One day after I installed the latest version it said that the old key is invalid and I had to get a new one. It checked with its homesite. Well, I registered with your new key and it worked but still how can it have checked the key although UI Agent was still blocked? Just a point  of concern.........."
,ereng,2011-02-02T07:48Z,"dinodig try to give a short with this one:

Step1. Block obdev.at in /etc/hosts by adding the line: 127.0.0.1 obdev.at
Step2. Block Little Snitch with Little Snitch - within LilSnitch Configuration, click ""New"" then select Deny Connections at top, and choose the application /Library/Little Snitch/Little Snitch UIAgent
Step3. Enter a serial number

Good luck!"

how do i do it if i have an older version (2.3.3) of the L. Snitch on my mac, and want to install this version? 

Do i have to de-install the old one fisrt and then install the new one , or i can also install the new one on the old one?

Thx a lot for the good job =O)"
