A one-hit wonder is a person or act known mainly for only a single success.
The term is most often used to describe music performers with only one hit single.
Most American music industry insiders consider a song in the top forty positions
of the Billboard Hot 100 to be a hit. Thus, any performer who recorded only one
song that reached the Top 40 is, technically, a one-hit wonder. However, the
term is more generally applied to musicians best known for only one song.

In the United Kingdom, the term one-hit wonder is used to describe a singer or
band who had only one hit reach the Top 75 on the UK Singles Chart. The term
was first used by the Guinness Book of Hit Singles from the 1970s, and originally
referred strictly to those artists whose first chart action was: â€œa number one hit,
and then nothing else, ever.â€ This is now commonly known as a â€œtrueâ€ one hit wonder.
