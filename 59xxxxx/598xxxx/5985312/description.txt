It is highly recommended for acquisition by libraries in universities on a worldwide scale, especially those that offer degree programs in the discipline. The Handbook is well organized and informative. It can well serve both as a text and a resource book for students of psychology and the social sciences as well as for individuals in the general public, internationally, who are curious about psychological science.Ã¢â‚¬Â
