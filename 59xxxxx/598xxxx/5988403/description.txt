Allmusic Review:
Tennessee Ernie Ford has quite a few Christmas collections on the market, but Fuel 2000's The Best of Christmas is the definitive one. Across 16 tracks, Ford lets his iron-jawed baritone frolic among choirs of angelic background singers, heavenly strings, and gently parping horns. Included are many holiday nuggets like "Silent Night," "The Little Drummer Boy," "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen," and "Joy to the World," done very faithfully and close to the vest. You may need to look elsewhere if you are looking for a Christmas record to bowl you over with high spirits and good cheer, but if you want a four-squared traditional holiday record suitable for everyone from 90-year-old great grandmas to babes wrapped in swaddling, look no further.
