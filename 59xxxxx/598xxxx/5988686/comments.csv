,sonicks,2010-11-28T01:04Z,thx a lot for ios 249 base 57 rev 20  i wasnt able to play online and now that i installed this update i can play online now fantastic :D
,JuhnuAW,2010-11-28T14:56Z,Sorry noob question. Where should i place the WAD. file? MMM goes to apps folder right?
,quirkynature,2010-11-30T17:21Z,"@JuhnuAW:

MMM goes into App folder. Copy the entire WAD folder provided into the root of your SD card.

Fire up your Wii, then HBC, then go to MMM. The rest is in the instructions. It's an easy enough process if you've softmodded your Wii. "

,tengig,2011-03-14T14:24Z,"i like the simplicity of mmm very nice but one thing after i dload the rev wad that was  provided my coverfloader locks up when it says loading hard drive so i have to reinstall my cios38rev14 to get rid of this new file to load my coverfloader and make all the other games work again any one have anythought, i know i didnt type this very clearly but hopefully some one can give me some insight"
,flat480,2011-03-24T05:26Z,"@tengig this file is for usbloader gx not coverfloader try going to google to fix your problem. im not trying to be a prick but the name does say usbloader gx. 
what i recommended to all is first update your usb loader gx to v 2.1 it fixes alot of issues.
just google (usbloader gx 2.1) or simply use the update option right on the loader itself.
@gsps24892 thanks for taking the time to make and upload the file. 
peace to all and happy fishing "
,JackAttackFR,2011-09-27T01:02Z,"With a 4.3 softmod:
symptom: MMM couldn't install ios 249 base 57 rev 20
diagnose: as stated in instruction file, check bottom line is 249 ... was 58 ! but can't load 249 because can't load stub (=kinda downgrade);
Solution: had to load Current to 251, install wad, then put back current to 58.
Works perfect ! including multiplayer afer game update (don't worry it's ingame content, not firmware update)."
