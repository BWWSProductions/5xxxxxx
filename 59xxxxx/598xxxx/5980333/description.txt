Allmusic Review:
Initially positioned as a white-girl R&B singer in the vein of TLC, P!nk quickly turned into something more distinctive, embracing rock & roll and confessionals in equal measure on her second album, 2001â€™s M!ssundaztood. â€œGet the Party Startedâ€ provided her breakthrough, its hedonism balanced by its raw-nerve sequel â€œDonâ€™t Let Me Get Me,â€ and from there she racked up a decadeâ€™s worth of hits, bouncing between these two extremes. Released in 2010, Greatest Hitsâ€¦So Far!!! rounds up the great majority of these hits, bypassing some singles -- her debut â€œMost Girlsâ€ and â€œYou Make Me Sick,â€ â€œGod Is a DJ,â€ â€œFunhouseâ€ and, most regrettably, â€œFeel Good Time,â€ her Beck/William Orbit-written entry for the Charlie's Angels II: Full Throttle soundtrack -- but hitting all the blockbusters (â€œThere You Go,â€ â€œJust Like a Pill,â€ â€œTrouble,â€ â€œStupid Girls,â€ â€œU + Ur Hand,â€ â€œSo What,â€ â€œPlease Donâ€™t Leave Meâ€) while adding two new entries to her canon: the rabble-rousing â€œRaise Your Glassâ€ and the profane love letter â€œF**kin' Perfect.â€ Both new entries are fine, even if they border ever so slightly on the conventional, but the real story of Greatest Hitsâ€¦So Far!!! is naturally the well-known hits that remain smart, addictive pop even after innumerable plays.
