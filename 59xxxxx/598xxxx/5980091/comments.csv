This is completely watchable and I'm picky with TS,R5,and CAM rips.  
This one gets thumbs up!"
,jm413d,2011-01-10T02:39Z,"Dunno about quality yet but wanted to comment about dl speed... My AVERAGE is 1.6 Mb/s and it hit 2.3Mb/s a few times and is staying pretty steady right now at 1.6-1.8 Mb/s... If you aren't getting speeds like that then upgrade from your cheap ass internet service and configure your torrent client correctly... You can't use something out of the box and expect it to work how you want it on the first try, you have to tweak it a bit to get everything set up correctly... A simple Google search will give you tips on how to configure your setup. Also if you have anything short of Broadband internet, we don't care about you sorry... Well DSL maybe but that's pushing it... Countless times I have asked someone who was complaining about speed what type of internet they had and got numerous answers of ""Dial-up"" LMFAO Here's your sign."
,jm413d,2011-03-01T07:51Z,"All this time and no comeback to my last post? LMFAO

Shut the fuck up if you say this was a cam... It's NOT
