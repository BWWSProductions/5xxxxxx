Format:Flac



Like Fat Possum label mate, R.L. Burnside, Mississippi bluesman, Junior Kimbrough found a career spike during the twilight of his life. Kimbrough picked up the guitar as a youngster and by the late â€™50s, he came into his own as a performer and songwriter.  He made his first recordings in 1966 but all but disappeared during the â€™70s and â€™80s, resurfacing occasionally to make a record or two.  In the early â€™90s, he opened his own juke joint, Juniorâ€™s Place.  The Chulahoma, Mississippi venue became a favorite diversion for members of U2 and the Rolling Stones during itâ€™s heyday.  It wasnâ€™t until 1992, that Kimbrough released his debut album, All Night Long, on Fat Possum.  The record was a critical smash and a hit with young blues and indie-rockers alike.  The Black Keys were such fans that they recorded an entire album, Culahoma, of songs written by Kimbrough.  He released two more albums before he passed away.  Junior Kimbrough suffered a fatal heart attack on January 17, 1998.  He was 67 when he died.
