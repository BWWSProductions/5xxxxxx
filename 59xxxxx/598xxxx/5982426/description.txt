It's Big Attitude Versus the Big City...

...for these two dudes on the verge of making it big in the electronic games and simulations industry, when a fateful trip to a couple of crucial meetings at the Electronic Entertainment Exposition (not to mention a couple of hot male modeling auditions) in Los Angeles changes their lives, and the course of video game history, forever.

It's not long before things GET DEADLY when our guys, Tim Rodgers (Action Buttons Dot Com) and Robert Pelosi (Bob's Games), find themselves in some real hot water with the locals! From down-town riots to run ins with the bumbling local Sheriff, GET BONUS: The Movie: @E3 2010 is a non-stop extravaganza of EPIC ACTION and a dark look into the seedy underbelly of the L.A. computer games industry.

Find out what happens when these two dudes with dreams of making it big bring their NO-NONSENSE ATTITUDE to the big city.
