Confessions of life as a Kardashian sisterâ€”stuffed with family stories, advice, beauty tips and exclusive gorgeous full color photos, personal snapshots and the inside scoop on their life growing up into the gorgeous Dash Dolls The stars of not one but two #1 reality television shows, and frequent cover girls on all the weeklymagazines, Kourtney, Kim & KhloÃ© Kardashian live large and glamorous lives. But not everything is on the screenâ€”how they really live, get along (and feud) as sisters is the subject of the Kardashiansâ€™ very first book. Kardashian Konfidential is their sisterhood autobiography, full of fun facts about their childhoods (guess who was the ugly duckling?), their beauty and style secrets, the wisdom they learned from their beloved father, and the street smarts they got from their mother that sustain them in life and in business. Kardashian Konfidential is bursting at the seams with photos, memorabilia, diary entries, datebook pages, and old Valentines the girls sent to each other, as well as many other artifacts put together just for their book. As glamorous, fun and fashionable as the girls themselves, this is the perfect buy-one-for-me-buy-three-for-friends fanâ€™s book.
