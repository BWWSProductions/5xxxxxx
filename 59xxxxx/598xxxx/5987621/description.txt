Yes, it is the only album you'll ever need, but than again, with over 
200 minutes of music, its nearly 5 times longer than the average 
Springsteen album!

The Live Box Set is an extremely impressive collection of Springsteen, 
arranged chronologically (with exception of the last track)

There is a reason this is the highest selling box-set of all time!

The First Track, Thunder Road, is the only one taken from the '75 tour 
(Born To Run), its missing its Rock and Roll feel, but stripped to the 
piano and no guitars or drums, it has a much more intimate feel to it 
that you can really appreciate.

The Next 8 Tracks are taken from the '78 Tour (Darkness On The Edge Of 
Town) and interestling enough, only 1 from the album released during that 
time. 

Here you'll find many early classics, from Its Hard To Be A Saint In The 
City, Rosalita and Growin' Up to an previously unreleased "Paradise By The 
'C.'"
 
Its also important to note that Bruce covers the song "Fire," a song he 
wrote, but was never released before, which had become a #1 hit for another 
group.
 
These are all immaculately recorded, and sound better than their original 
albums, they are taken from the Roxy, which holds only a few thousand, if 
even that (some say closer to 1000) so you get that small, intimate feeling.

The next several tracks are from the "River Tour" in '80 and '81 and are 
mostly tracks from his '78 album (Darkness On the Edge Of Town) Including 
blistering versions of Badlands, Darkness On The Edge Of Town and Candy's 
Room. 

Also included here is an electrifying previously unreleased version of 
"Because The Night" the song Springsteen co-wrote with Patti Smith. 

Also included is a cover of Woody Guthrie's "This Land Is Your Land" and
a very good cover at that, 3 of his songs from his recent album are also 
included in Cadillac Ranch, You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch) and 
Independence Day. 

These tracks are nearly all taken from Arenas.

The rest of this collection (final 5 Tracks of Disc 2 and All of Disc 3) 
are taken from Bruce's most recent tour (when this came out) and his 
record-breaking one, the Born In The USA tour. 

First, we have 3 songs from his Album "Nebraska," which, while they don't 
have the feel they have on his album, sound much better because of first 
rate recording equipment.
 
There is a thunderous organ version of Born In The USA, which, upon listen, 
doesn't measure up to the Album's version, but the more you listen to it, 
the better it sounds to you.

The highlights of this tour are a version of Born To Run that blows away the 
album's version, and it is the definitive version of the song.
 
Great recordings of "The River" and "The Promised Land", along with a great 
cover of the song "War" which makes the original look poor in comparison. 

An acoustic version of "No Surrender" and a fanstastic horn version of 
"Tenth Avenue Freezeout." 

Overall, the songs sound much better live than they do in the studio, 
particularly songs from Darkness On The Edge of Town and The River, Some of 
the songs from Born In The USA sound exactly the same (Bobby Jean, Working On 
The Highway, Darlington County) and some a little worse (Cover Me) Some great 
previously unreleased material (Fire, Because The Night, War, Raise Your Hand, 
Seeds) also helps. 

In all cases, the recordings are immaculately done, and are as clear as possible,
and considering the amount of stuff here, this is essential for anyone even 
remotely interested in Springsteen. 
 
Even though its missing a few songs that should be on it (Blinded By The Light, 
Prove It All Night, Out In The Street, I'm Goin Down, Dancing In The Dark, 
Glory Days) it doesn't suffer much from not having them. 

Get this album today, you won't regret it, and will listen to it rather than to 
the studio albums.
