I WANT CANDY!
Cut the Rope combines realistic physics with simple, yet accurate and precise touch controls. Cut the ropes by simply swiping your finger across them and collect the stars by touching them with the candy, but itâ€™s not always simple. Think before you slice and be sure to avoid the enemies and obstacles. Every level is different and getting that candy to Om Nom wonâ€™t be easy!


ITâ€™S KNOT GONNA BE A BREEZE
In Cut the Rope you donâ€™t just need to feed Om Nom, in order to get maximum points you will also need to collect three golden stars in each stage. Some are easy, some are deviously difficult; youâ€™re going to have to use your head to get them all-but be quick, some of these stars donâ€™t hang around forever! Dodge jagged spikes that smash your candy to bits, and look out for sneaky spiders intent on having Om Nomâ€™s treat all for themselves! 


STAR PLAYER
Use a variety of special tools in your effort to get Om Nom his candy. Blow candy around in bubbles using special air pumps, catapult your candy across the screen to get to those hard to reach stars, use hidden ropes and special pulleys in your effort to get every star there is! 


THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX, INSIDE THE BOX
Easy to learn and intuitive to play, Cut the Rope is hard to put down. As you progress, Om Nom will jump from one box to another, with more levels to get through. With each new box contains new and even more challenging stars and obstacles, can you make it to the end?
