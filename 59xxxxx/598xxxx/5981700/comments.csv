Some simple googling could have answered your questions, my dear suckers.

,Saki33,2010-11-25T02:38Z,"Out of curiosity I checked in to see if any fakes on a night the show doesn't air and sure enough there is, and look at all the gullible people downloading this FAKE!

I always check tv.com to see which nights tv shows are broadcast and you can see that there wasn't one this Monday.

Remove it. It's a

,icandyman,2010-11-27T06:53Z,Totally fucking fake. 
,verap,2010-11-28T16:39Z,FAKE FAKE FAKE
,CinnamonScent,2010-11-29T22:37Z,It's fake. The episode airs tonight.
,Saki33,2010-11-29T23:48Z,"Unbelievable! Don't any of those seeders read the comments? But I have answered my own question. The real question should be why is this still up? It was posted on the 24th and the show airs on the 29th, so obviously FAKE. You'd have to think the uploaders were pretty stupid to post it so far ahead of the broadcast, but they keep reeling the suckers in don't they?"
