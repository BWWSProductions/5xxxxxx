,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-01-16T09:07Z,how do u select audio 2?
,dbrot,2011-05-18T11:32Z,"@chromatic: VLC player, under audio menu should have track/channel selections

@McBoingBoing: Perhaps change to a torrent program that let's you see what type of files are contained in a torrent before downloading. Expecting a BluRay full feature film to be under 7GB is never going to happen. Please learn to spot the differences.

Cheers for the this GF, will start the download."

[V],big_dad_e,2011-07-09T07:45Z,McBoingBoing is just a Troll with nothing to offer except his ignorant comments.
,rlhq23,2011-08-25T05:31Z,"Chromatic- There is an excellent program called MKVtoolnix that allows you to drag the mkv file into the GUI, and select which audio streams, video streams, and subtitles you want. Assuming you're looking for english only- I would recommend just deselecting track #1 (Russian) and remuxing it. The program also tells you what language the audio or subtitle track is which is convenient. "
