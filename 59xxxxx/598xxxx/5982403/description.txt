The preparation for the London Olympics is a huge and very funny developing story. Eleven thousand people are now employed on the Olympic site to ensure everything is in place, on time. One and a half million tons of East End soil have been washed. Lorries, arriving on site at the rate of one per minute, are subjected to the same rigorous timetabling that applies at Heathrow Airport. Visitors undergo extensive security checks and are issued with a list of over sixty prohibited items (amongst them, animal stunners, ice picks and blowtorches).

It's an exciting race against time; the most important race of all being the one to get a memorable Olympic programme on air. This four-part "documentary" series is all fired up and ready to go. On your marks.

Introduced from the standpoint of 2014 by controversial reporter Sylvester Halloran (Kevin Eldon), What Went Wrong With The Olympics? combines contemporary news reports, archive footage, stupid "audio graphics", live interviews and fisticuffs in the studio with the key figures responsible. We sift through the cock-ups and the conspiracies in a tough and revealing probe into the reality of what makesrun - not very fast.
