Based on the song Puff, the Magic Dragon by Peter, Paul, & Mary
Jackie is a boy who is so trapped by his fears and doubts that he could not
communicate with anyone. His condition is so severe that the doctors are giving
up and the parents are losing hope for him to live as something more than a
zombie. Then, a magic dragon named Puff comes to help Jackie by taking his
soul force on a wonderous voyage to his island of Honah Lee. Along the way,
they have adventures that nurture Jackies imagination and courage in
unorthodox ways. However, their arrival at Honah Lee is marked with horror as
they see the land despoiled and desolate which leaves Puff powerless. Yet while
trapped in his despair, Puff sees to his own astonishment just how well he has
changed Jackie for the better as the boy responds to this tragedy in his own way.
