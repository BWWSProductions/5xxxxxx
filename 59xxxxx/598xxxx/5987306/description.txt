About B.U.G.S.:

Each decade has brought us new challenges - Flower Power, Punk Rock or designer underwear: We've survived and defeated them all and finally sent them back to where they belong. But now our oddest nightmares are coming true - a new enemy is sending masses of invaders to infect our computers, palmtops, dish washers and even some of the coffee-percolators!

The only way to prepare for the final battle is to live abstinent (OK, this one isn't _that_ necessary), think fast, practice hard and - of course - use the appropriate training tool.

The Ultimate Arcade Game for OS/2 Warp.

So: Fasten your seat belts and blast your way through the hordes of mutant bugs, spiders and other nasty creatures in this original fast-paced galaga style arcade game. Dazzling graphics and explosive sounds meet you as you pilot your lonely ship trying to free the galaxy from Bills Evil BUGS!
