rhythms from the orient has a fantastic side one with the intro of
rakst al fadaa[dance of space] and guitar al shark [guitar of orient]
both are personal favorites and composed by the promising young
lebanese composer nour al malah..
though side two that i feel it was rushed to complete the album
minus the great preformance of oum kalsoum song lelit hob ..
each time i view the cover i see the male model as salvador dali that
has the same mostache and almost the same face too...
if u take good look at the male model of belly dance covers , he is
probably the same one here [ minus the moustache] likely both
came from the same source...
