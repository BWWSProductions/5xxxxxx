Yep, more than capable thanks, now why won't you work?

Tried uninst and reinst, tried compatibility, tried gfx driver updates.

Game will not start."

,Vvornth,2010-11-27T17:56Z,"For me, the game starts. 
But i can't change the resolution, i change in settings from 1280 x 720 to 1680 x 1050 but when i start the game it is back to 1280 x 720. It doesn't save the changes, really weird.."
,Vvornth,2010-11-27T18:00Z,"Lol, nevermind. 
It worked when i started the MXsettings.exe with administrator :)
I'm using Windows 7 x64"

,Army_of_assholes,2010-11-28T13:22Z,the application has encountered an error and has closed. please check if your hardware is sufficient to run this application. What is the problem? Have tried everything. To poor computer or what?
,axero,2010-11-28T15:11Z,"The only solution I worked out. And this is genuinely how I got this game to work...

Fuck the run as admin, updating drivers/dxsetup, that's all bullshit, this game is just broken.

To get it to work, start the game, then before it can do anything, hit ctrl-alt-del, and then cancel that. Game should load.

That's what I have to do every time I start it. No guarantees it will work for everyone. And I know it sounds insane, but that's how batshit broken this game is.

,_Avid_,2010-12-21T22:27Z,"OKAY HERE IT IS PEOPLE LOL DURR : ITS A STEAM GAME U DONT EVEN NEED THE CRACK 
1. INSTALL STEAM 
2. DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL THE UNDEAD PATCH FOR STEAM (!!IT ISNT NECCESARY I DONT THINK!! BUT MAKES IT SO U CAN DOWNLOAD FREE GAMES AND STUFF IT ONLY WORKS FOR SMALL FILES)
3. GO TO ""ADD A NON STEAM GAME""
4. ADD BOTH THE SETTING EXE AND GAME EXE
5. GO TO YOUR GAME LIST IN STEAM AND LOOK FOR MX VS ATV, HIT PLAY, ENJOY!!

**EDIT** ONE THING I DID ADD WAS THE ""STEAMCLIENT.DLL"" FILE FROM THE CRACK TO GAME INSTALL DIR BUT IDK IF IT MATTERS"
,ciprojects,2010-12-23T05:22Z,"i am working on a xp fix crack can you upload the original executables for mxreflex.exe and mxsettings.exe so that i can work on it because i dont have the original executables, I only the cracked versionâŚ pls so we can fix this"
,dromatic,2011-02-21T07:55Z,"For those of you getting the gay ""Hardware not supported error""'s simply disable your secondary video adapter and the game launches fine. :) Worked for me!"
,braadpan,2011-04-04T00:20Z,"IF THE GAME CRASH TRY THIS:

1 Go THQ->Mx Vs Atv Reflex->Installers
2 RUN DXSETUP.exe

WORKED FOR ME!"
,raB-raB,2011-10-04T02:35Z,"game loads fine, but for some reason it is very slow and unresponsive, even on the lowest settings it has delayed movement and acts like it is glitching.
"
,Lariet1974,2012-05-15T10:02Z,"Anyone having a problem getting this game to work, go into your game folder, where u installed it to, and go to the folder named ""installers"" and in there manually click on ur Directx and VCredist. The game wasn't working for me, and I did that, and it's working great, just can't get my controller to work yet. But I will get it. Good luck everyone."
