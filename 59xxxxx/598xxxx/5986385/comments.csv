,skullfox1,2010-12-09T22:07Z,installing now will let you know how everything turns out. thanks uploader!
,brandNoobian,2010-12-12T17:24Z,"is it just me or should it take forever to install ?
also i dont feel comfortable registering online.
is this release real ?"
,barnsley-lad,2010-12-14T02:48Z,"you'll probably find that EVERY copy of nero 9 takes approx 1 hour to install. everyone i know with nero 9 complains about how long it takes to install. 

the main thing is ""IT WORKS""

"
,jdoggy,2010-12-17T03:36Z,"This works. Do everything in the ""read me first"" file EXCEPT opening the Activator application. It's a Trojan virus!! barnsley-lad you're a piece of shit for sending out a virus!!! I didn't have to disable my antivirus to be able to install Nero FYI folks. barnsley-lad only wants you to do this, so he can infect your computer!"
,map4442646,2010-12-17T23:38Z,"@Jdoggy wow dude you are dumb... You are over here calling people names and all... All keygens/activators are by default detected as a virus by every anti-virus out there unless its a shity one because they are HACKING TOOLS.. I suggest you stop acusin people before you know what you are talking about. Or go to the store and buy the software if it bothers you so much. And on top of everything its not that hard getting rid of a virus, but you would know that right? No? then perhaps go read on the net see if you learn something new"
,barnsley-lad,2010-12-19T15:52Z,"@ jdoggy, go fcuk yourself mother pucker. r u thick or what ? ALL anti virus software programmes pick up cracks/activatotrs as trojans ""FOR PIRACY REASONS"" 

thick mother pucker"
,barnsley-lad,2010-12-19T15:55Z,"@ map, thankyou my friend. there's allways one lol"
,harpo500919,2010-12-21T23:59Z,"First- thanks Barnsley Lad.  Appreciate your efforts.  Unfortunately, although I followed instructions carefully, the Activator didn't work.  It didn't actually do anything.  Resorted to trying to activate from within Nero itself, but it told me that permissible number of activations for that serial already used up....  Then tried entering the serial from the Activator into Nero and then trying to use the Activator again.  Nothing happened.  And predictably, when I tried to activate with that serial it refused and told me (shock, horror) that it was a pirated serial.  Am I doing anything wrong.  Is it worth uninstalling and reinstalling?  I suspect the Activator will still be ""inactive"".  Any ideas?"
,harpo500919,2010-12-22T02:04Z,"Got it working fine, now.  Solution was not to use the unpacked Activator.exe, but instead open the Activator using ""View"" within WinRAR, opening ""Form1"", and then clicking the Activator.exe file.  Same with Patcher.bat file.  Both apps executed, and Nero is now fully up and running.  All aspects tested OK.  Thanks heaps."
,ghost0308,2010-12-26T06:30Z,"This torrent rocks man! Everything about the installation and activation went so smooth and according to the instructions in the read me! No problems whatsoever with the activation as mentioned before...the activator works fine and it's straightforward to use!! After everything is done, if anyone wants to check for the licence you can go to the Nero Control Centre (All Programs>Nero 9 and click on NCC and once on the NCC go to the License Tab and you will see under the ""Expire"" there is ""None"" which means there is no expiry date on any of the Nero Tools!!!!! F***ing amazing!!! Yes, this is a reason to start jumping up and down in the room...download this torrent and read the ""Read Me"" and you'll see what I mean, lol.
One question to barnsley-lad: Can we do updates?????
Thanks for this mate!!!"
,ghost0308,2010-12-26T06:34Z,"...nearly forgot:
""jdoggy"" you are a twat...go and learn to appreciate other people's hard work so that you can be sat on your fat arse and enjoying this stuff FOR FREE!!!!!!"
,the_trust,2010-12-31T16:22Z,"So I didn't Config Or Disable my Anti virus because I like the warm feeling of being safe. I unzipped it, Opened it up, Put in the serial and then 20 minutes later I said register Later. All done. Thats it. All works fine. Just my Input. Don't abuse me.

~Trust~"
,ovirto,2011-01-05T21:35Z,"@barnesley-lad, fantastic upload!  Thanks for sharing.   

All, do not attempt to upgrade this version.  The upgrade version that you can currently retrieve from the Nero site is 9.4.44.0.  The Activator  will not work for that version.  I tried it out on my win7 virtualbox.  I tried both an upgrade as well as a fresh install (after I rolled back my snapshot to a clean OS) to v9.4.44.0 and both failed.  Also, I did not have to disable my anti-virus (Avast Free running the latest 1/5/2011 virus defs) to run the Activator.

The version packaged with this torrent works like a charm though!  Thank you!"
,benny01253,2011-01-11T16:21Z,"I'm quite new to this and I coudln't disable my AVG Virus scanner unless I uninstalled it. Didn't need to switch it off anyway. Nero 9 works well and wouldn't even be tempted to update it. It will work well for a couple of years as it is, many thanks barnsley-lad! Highly recommended download"
,Lasaruz,2011-01-15T06:26Z,Thank you!
,Chris8481,2011-01-27T12:15Z,"beware, it carries 3 trojans, so dont download"
,bjs001,2011-01-29T10:37Z,"Not sure why, but for me the installation stalls at around 65 % then nothing happens? Thanks anyway barnsley-lad!"
,brianehenry,2011-03-29T04:08Z,Also installs antimalware doctor virus :)  ..it is a common misconception ..a properly packed key-gen usually will not set off the anti virus..this does because it is one lol 
,urdoomd,2011-06-05T21:10Z,"@ all the ""twats"" out there bashing jdoggy. I have PLENTY of cracks and keygens that do NOT detect as viruses. brianehenry is absolutely right about this. A ""properly"" packed crack or keygen will NOT set off the antivirus and if it does i will not touch it. period. So all you twats out there, have fun with your infections :) Thank you for everyone's virus reports and saving me download time and bandwith. barnsley-lad, eat toad. And not just any toad. An infected toad."
,shesashairy,2011-08-16T04:07Z,"Cheers Barnsley-lad... I know this is pukka before even installing... I reckon nowadays the more spooks dissing a torrent = guaranteed good shit... PS incase you brain doners dint allready know AVG Avast anf Avira quarantine ANYTHING called ""blanketyblank.exe"" on first sight IE as soon as the folder its in is opened.... it used to be as the file was activated.... I expect Norton and all the paid for shit also sells your ip address to RIAA .... BTW only downloading this cos I finally switched to Win7$0 and my multi bootlegged Nero6 with every possible option wont work. Shit man if you can afford it go buy the prog, if not do what you can to survive mutees... as for the disinformationists from @-Head or microdollar please go on with the wind ups, it makes it easier to see what will work... OR you could actually just be dicks... nuff said!!"
,Dumaine,2011-10-16T18:19Z,10/16/2011..........this is still working torrent. Followed readme to the T and installed perfectly!!  Thanks!!!
