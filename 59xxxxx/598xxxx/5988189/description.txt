Allmusic Review:
While it may seem rather incongruous for the definitive voices of summertime to tackle the music of the holiday season, The Beach Boys' Christmas Album succeeds brilliantly; Brian Wilson's pop genius is well suited to classic Yuletide fare, and the group delivers lush performances of standards ranging from "Frosty the Snowman" to "White Christmas" as well as more contemporary material like "The Man With All the Toys" and "Blue Christmas." The Capitol reissue also includes four bonus tracks, including "The Lord's Prayer" and the single version of "Little Saint Nick."
