have u tried it ...is it good...
.."
,vaibhav03,2010-11-24T17:50Z,but its release date is in december...
[V],globeplus,2010-11-24T18:14Z,"To vaibjav :  it is a new adventure with the tradicional nice gameplay of the game and after Jimmys Vendetta , this is a new nice one , this game is really getting nice dlcs to the users ."
,xiIix,2010-11-24T18:50Z,"Yeah nice DLC's, but it'd be real fuckin nice if the assholes would let us mod the damn game. They're making it seriously difficult, and they also went WAY overboard with the initial DLC runs with all those bullshit vendor specials. If you have a LEGIT copy, you can't even have ALL the DLC's. This could've been one of the greatest games ever made in the history of gaming, but they had to go and ruin it by giving us the middle finger and being all uptight about modders wanting to make the game awesome.

I say fuck DLC's, open up the game, let us mod it, let us fix the fucking problems that need fixing that they refuse to fix, because right now us modders have our hands tied behind out back."
,aasif.k30,2010-11-24T19:17Z,"thnx globeplus. downloading it now. I want to ask u one question, In ur rips only movies r downgraded and everything like music files, texture files are original. Is it true."
[V],globeplus,2010-11-24T19:20Z,"To xiIix : that it is a nice suggestion and some games let that happen but this things gives lot of work and this dlcs are enjoyable , so the ideal is new nice dlcs that still make sense and probably if possible the mods stuff too ."
[V],globeplus,2010-11-24T19:25Z,"To aasif.k30 : everything is keeped and certainly all the gameplay , what can happen it is correct work with things that is possible to do correct competent work and that can happen depending on the game , in this one i worked very competently the videos and the rest is absolute normal , one thing you can have in mind about my work and i can say this without any speculation : the game or in this case the dlc is analised correct and the possible best competent work it will be what comes out to the users , no doubt !!"
,u2r1,2010-11-24T20:22Z,can you upload Tom Clancys H.A.W.X. 2 chears for all other up loads 
[V],globeplus,2010-11-25T07:57Z,"Because the nice number of polish usewrs on this file , i decide to put in a nice link the polish language with intructions toi easy include on the dlc , it is like this : if the version of the game is in polish probably the langiage can be accepted , so the user get everything in polish less the only 3 videos thatv remains in english .

,szczaqusnake,2010-11-25T16:49Z,"Thanks for the polish language globe :D I'm seeding now. But I have a problem. 
When I go to the train station to get Stan, the infinite loading appears, and it loads loads loads... Any fix? Or maybe some patch? "
[V],globeplus,2010-11-25T18:54Z,"To szczaqusnake : i donÂ´t know , maybe someone else knows something , i get the best stuff that at least worked without hanging on the load at the beginning and i made it the necessary adjustments , so i donÂ´t know , try again or get tips for that in the net ."
,wtfgamer,2010-11-26T00:43Z,     Hi Globe. I appreciate your works. Can you make a useful batch file to make one click process. Thanks.
[V],globeplus,2010-11-26T04:58Z,"To wtfgamer : it is the next thing my friendly user : a batch process not so pratical for moving complete folders to a computer installation folder that have special administarative rights , the more correct way is by installation but with that we have another points not so positive like you have to browse the install folder and if really make sense inside the game folder like you have with the installed folders and of course can happen a uninstall small program with the installation just to ununistall the added dlc , so analising this particularitys the more correct and safe to the user is to have nice coordenatination with the essencial files then the user manually move or copy the included files or folders to the installation game folder .

,hemingway60,2010-11-26T13:03Z,"Are you going to upload harry potter and the deathly hallows?
