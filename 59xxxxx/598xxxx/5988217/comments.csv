,Geminorum,2010-11-26T23:31Z,"Hur gör man för att byta Bios till ett nyare ?
NTSC - Notably not the standard durchschnittlich in Deutschland/Duitsland.
Hur får man då dessa holländre o bli lika lacka som Polacker .. se ovan.
Obs detta har inget med Polacker att göra,"

Vertaling van het Zweeds in het Nederlands
Hoe verander je de BIOS naar een nieuwere?
NTSC - met name let op de standaard durchschnittlich in Deutschland / Duitsland.
Hoe krijg je deze holländre o gelijk verf als Polen .. zie hierboven.
Let op: dit heeft niets te maken met de Polen,


Das duidelijker toch ?

Hey Jack first off hes pointing out ""piratebay"" originated in Sweden you dumbfuck.

Secondly Sweden wasn't the ""neutral"" country in WW2. America was more neutral due to the fact they did not engage until 1941. Sweden was captured by Germany in 1939 I believe or prehaps the 40's.

Switzerland was and is the neutral country you were thinking of you ignorant inbred fuck.

Please be more stereotypically American, its fucking hilarious."
,Frice,2010-12-10T18:45Z,"""During the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Sweden allowed the Wehrmacht to use Swedish railways to transport (June–July 1941) the 163rd Infantry Division along with howitzers, tanks and anti-aircraft weapons and associated ammunition, from Norway to Finland. German soldiers traveling on leave between Norway and Germany were allowed passage through Sweden""

So they weren't captured but then again they did help the Germans. Neutrality? Debatable."
