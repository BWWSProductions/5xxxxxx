,SoftWarez,2010-11-26T19:16Z,WTF? mislabeling again. not yours. its by SQ. Just put the original name.
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-11-26T19:33Z,Hanen't called it mine - ffs - look at the release name in the details dumbass!
[V],Horrorspoke,2010-11-26T19:41Z,"Did i put 'HoRrOrSpOkE' next to it? no - i just left the SQ from the title because the title itself is confusing enough!

The details of the release group are in the torrent description, and also no doubt in the .nfo file. pft!"
