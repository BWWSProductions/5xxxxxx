John Lee Hooker Jack O'Diamonds: 1949 Recordings: Released 2004.
 
The material on Jack o' Diamonds was recorded in 1949 but never 
released at the time due to John Lee Hooker's vast contractual 
problems. 

Even at this earliest point in his career, Hooker was tied up 
in contracts that would see him recording under several aliases 
in order to make some quick cash. 

These 20 cuts were recorded at a private gathering in the Detroit 
dining room of Gene Deitchat, who set up a primitive recording 
device and let Hooker play. 

During the course of the evening those present began requesting 
that he play a few spirituals and folk tunes. 

It's interesting to hear Hooker bite into such traditional fare 
as Two White Horses, Trouble in Mind, John Henry, and also 
Jack o' Diamonds.

Since these recordings have been cleaned and remastered, this 
disc is well worth picking up for Hooker fanatics.
