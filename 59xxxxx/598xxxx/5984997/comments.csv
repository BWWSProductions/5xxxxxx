,jjacobslooksee,2011-12-20T16:15Z,"I fairly recently installed a Magic Jack voice over phone & also learned that Switch Sound File Converter would enable me to play MJ voice mails from the computer (as opposed to physically picking up telephone handset and dialing voice mail).  I thought I had downloaded freeware & it turned out the Switch File was a trial that expired.  I'm hoping this one is not a trial version also, but it looks like it isn't.  Thank you so much for making life more convenient, ChattChitto! It download and installed well on my Windows 7, 64 bit and since this was smooth as silk (even the great music was), I don't anticipate any problems installing on a 32  bit Vista computer  in a little while.
