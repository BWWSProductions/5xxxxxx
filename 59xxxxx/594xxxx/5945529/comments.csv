,42ndDruid,2010-11-21T16:30Z,We need seeders for this epic DL. It looks great but I may never know unless someone seeds.
,gordogato,2010-11-22T07:35Z,"Lol I am currently the Only Seed, sorry ^^ once someone gets 100% then it will go a lot faster, i recommend downloading the ova's movies, live actions, and what not first, because those have already been seeded 100% the episodes and case closed have not"
,42ndDruid,2010-11-23T12:58Z,"Once I reach 100%, I will seed indefinitely. When are you seeding? I saw the seed number go up one around 10pm EST."
,marcus1story,2010-12-14T12:36Z,"Did he stop seeding, I was really hoping to download this too! I would seed this for as long as I can if I can download this!"
,gordogato,2011-01-13T07:17Z,"Hello again, I actually just threw this torrent on TPB. I just let the DHT and Peer Exchange seed it. However, I am updating this torrent and you can find it on Demonoid. If you will indefinitely seed I would love to have you download it. I will even give you a demonoid invite if you don't have one. "
,Jacob8185,2011-07-01T21:37Z,"Once I finish downloading, I will seed indefinitely. I just need to get the Case Closed episodes/movies and the regular episodes."
,Kietriss,2011-11-03T19:35Z,"I had to drop my pc, but I'm back and once the last bit finishes I'll be seeding till my modem explodes."
