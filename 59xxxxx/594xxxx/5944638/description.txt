HQ promo music video. "Something About You" is a single released by British Jazz funk band Level 42 in 1985, in advance of its inclusion on the album World Machine the same year. The song was written by Mark King, Mike Lindup, Phil Gould, Boon Gould and Wally Badarou. 

"Something About You" was released in several countries beyond the United Kingdom, including United States, Germany, Italy, Canada and many countries of South America and Asia. It is the only Level 42 song to be a top ten hit in the United States, where it reached #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart; and is their second top 10 in the United Kingdom, reaching #6 on the UK Singles Chart. 

This music video of Something About You is directed by Stuart Orme. Mark King is characterized as a dark magician, it represents the negative side of the relationship of Mike Lindup, Phil, and Boon Gould with their girlfriends; all played by actress Cherie Lunghi. 

Another common interpretation of the video is as follows: Mark King is in the train with his band, throughout the video he is seen observing what it would be like if his band members were in a relationship with his girlfriend, whom he meets at the end of the video.
