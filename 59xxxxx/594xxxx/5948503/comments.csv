Thanks a lot!"
,IAMH67,2010-11-11T11:44Z,"can someone who has downloaded this answer a question for me. 
The other torrents uploaded of the final episode ""Episode 31"" are 700 mb so it will be around 1 hours and 30 minutes in legnth?
 while this one is 700 mb and contains both ""episode 30"" and ""episode 31"". Can someone confirm that it contains both episodes?

Also, There was a sudden drop in seeds from 900 to (now) 300 seeds. I know Boarding does not upload fake torrents so could it be that there is a problem with the video file or something that no one is seeding it? 
Uploader or someone who has downloaded please reply ,its taking too long to download because of the bad ratio and i cant check for myself."

,DTTNWO,2010-11-13T19:48Z,Thanks for all the ups Mr. BoardinGG. I had tried to avoid finding out who won and succeded untill just before these last 2 files were uploaded when I logged onto a pokerste and the winner flashed up. Gutted. Didn't enjoy the WSOP quite as much as last year but it was still very good. Roll on WSOP 2011!
