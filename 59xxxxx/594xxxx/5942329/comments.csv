It's not 1080p though, but rather 812p to be exact.  Not that it matters to me, just thought I'd mention it in case it matters to someone else."

Downloaded an .srt off the net and even that didn't include the subs for the non English parts of the movie. Kind of weak to download for two weeks and feel like I only saw half the movie.....Unless I am missing something your info is wrong. A-10, V-10 still upset a bit but thanks for the upload."

Someone, like the uploader, needs to get the DVDr version, and copy / edit the subs over for the HD version.

Totally worth it for a movie this good and beautiful."
