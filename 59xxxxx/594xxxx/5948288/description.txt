    Wallace and Gromit explore the mysteries behind man's      
    fascination with flight, from 'homemade' space rockets    
    in Manchester to jetpacks in the UK. There is also a     
    look at some planes that unfortunately don't fly in       
    another Contraption Countdown.                             
                                                              
    On location in the USA, we explore the most advanced     
    flexible spacesuits being developed by NASA that are      
    designed to allow wearers to perform cartwheels on Mars    
    and in Germany we look at the life of Gustav Mesmer, a    
    man obsessed with flight, but whose inner inventor was   
    locked inside his own imagination for years, and who      
    finally got to realise his dreams of flying bicycles.      
                                                              
    Finally, Wallace's Science Correspondent Jem Stansfield  
    travels to California to investigate the connection       
    between David Beckham and an eerie-looking spherical       
    airship.
