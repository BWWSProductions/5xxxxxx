,Gaslighttwin31,2010-12-23T20:58Z,"Thanks for this torrent. I can confirm it does work but it took me some searching on google to find out how. I'm using the latest version of wii flow. On your SD card delete your wdm file for the sims 3 /wiiflow/codes/wdm/S3M.wdm
and use in gamesettings the alt dol method (main.dol for single player and mplr.dol for multi player) 
the wdm file for the sims 3 seems broken atm. Hope this helps some of you."
