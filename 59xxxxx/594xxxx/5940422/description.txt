Pink has come away with one more blockbuster hit, after touring for months this is one for the fans.   She sings about us not all being the same and that those in the minority are unique and should stand tall.   The video is (as we have come to expect) cutting and pulls punches at every turn, putting the Bull in charge of the Matador, cows milking humans, and Pink?  Well being just Pink.



The song drives along and I fully expect this to be in the top 10 all over Europe and North America by the time I get this online.   Widescreen.  MPEG2 from HI Def TV Logo free.   Audio 192 Kbs.  Enjoy!
