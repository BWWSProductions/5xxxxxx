,alThoran,2010-11-08T11:48Z,"Thanks.
Is there any organized error-proofing? Any way someone could participate?"
,kash79,2010-11-08T14:48Z,"@ alThoran,well,this is a pretty readable version (1.0),but it can def. be improved,there will still be some minor errors,so any monor corrections that r made by anyone,the version will go to 1.1 or 1.2...and so on,if any major errors r corrected then version can jump to 2.0 or 3.0.

a version 4.0 will look like the real book,for eg,,it will have covers,no spelling errors,will have italics, proper spacing between lines and paragraphs,a working TOC(table of contents) and of course will be proof-read against the real book.

anyone can make the corrections,update the version no. and re-upload the file."
,alThoran,2010-11-08T15:25Z,Thanks for the info.
,zarqy,2010-11-09T19:24Z,"Thanks for this.  Fuck TOR books, and fuck Harriat for their greed and environmental irresponsibility in not releasing this in e-book format.  I WOULD have bought it for the kindle for the same price as hard cover, but they made the bone headed decision to wait a year to release it!  Thanks again to kash79, you're the best!"
,Sporkybay,2010-11-09T20:54Z,"Wow, Zargy, you're a dumb piece of shit. One, without Harriet, there would have been no WoT, as she was the editor who discovered Jordan. Two, while I'm like you, and prefer e-formatted books, I understand that purchases of e-copies of books don't get counted toward the NY best seller list, and therefore a simultaneous release actually undercuts the sales figures. I actually care about Jordan's legacy, and know how important this is. If you were a real fan, you'd understand this and do what I did; buy the hardcover and download the ""e-book"" backup from here. "
,kash79,2010-11-10T03:26Z,"@ zarqy,the official e-book will now be released on Feb. 2011 instead of November 2011.

Brandon Sanderson confirmed this on his Twitter page,he requested Harriet to move the ebook release date ti Feb. 2011 and she agreed,this happened after a lot of fans put pressure on Sanderson and TOR books."
,alThoran,2010-11-10T11:54Z,"@Sporkybay I am a fan too, but I don't agree with you at all. And especially with your insults.

1. I'm pretty sure the greatest influence on the existence or non-existence of WoT was RJ himself, don't you think? No denying, Harriet was a great help, as editor as well as wife, but that doesn't mean WoT exists only because of her. Things could have been different, someone else could have discovered and married RJ, he could have made a contract with a more open-minded publisher and so on.

And 2: Don't you think WoT is well-known enough not to be affected by the NY bestseller list?

This ""no-ebook-for-you"" move is dumb in the extreme. They could have made tons of money (and sales numbers, for that matter) if they published the ebook on Day 1. Creating and ebook is cheaper that a physical book, and there are virtually no costs for multiplying it, distributing it to bookstores, storing it on a shelf in a bookstore, shipping it to the customers etc."

,johnnywiz,2010-11-13T01:11Z,"Better than the first version released, but still pretty rough with some formatting problems in the epub version that make it hard to read. And Thom still appears as ""Thorn"" more often than not. Thanks for the time put into this though. "
,Furazela,2010-11-23T05:56Z,"Thanks for the upload.

Unfortunately not quite up to my standards, so I improved it a bit, and uploaded at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5977602"
