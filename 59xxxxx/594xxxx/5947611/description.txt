Yes: Songs From Tsongas - Yes 35th Anniversary Concert H.264 .m4v/.mp4

Judging from the number of downloads of shows that I've packaged into  H.264 MP4's, there appears to be a large demand for these shows in a modern video container.  To support these and future downloads I ask YOU KEEP SEEDING after your download is complete.   THANKS!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I took VIDEO TS files of each of the two DVD's and ripped H.264 MP4 files of each movie.  The files have a suffix of .m4v as they were ripped using HandBrake 0.9.4 so they can be played on any current iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or in iTunes.  They can also be played on any compliant player but you may need to change the suffix from .m4v to .mp4.

A note about the audio:

It was a BITCH.  HandBrake wanted to only give a 2 ch. stereo mix.  After experimenting, I think I now have alternative Dolby Digital 5.1 mix
The videos indicate a separate channel with Dolby Digital 5.1 when you "Get Info" using iTunes. 

A note about the video:  

It looks great on my computer, but I see some chunk blocks in dark backgrounds when playing on my Apple TV.  I've re-ripped but I have a feeling it is my TV or Apple TV screwing up.  LEAVE COMMENTS if you have problems.  I hope you don't.

Yes: Songs From Tsongas - Yes 35th Anniversary Concert

It's not everyday that music lovers get the opportunity to witness one of rock's most enduring acts take the stage to celebrate its 35th reunion, but now viewers who weren't able to make the show in person can witness the magic firsthand as the classic Yes lineup of Jon Anderson, Steve Howe, Chrish Squire, Rick Wakeman, and Alan White celebrate over three decades of music and memories. In addition to a full set that includes such classic Yes tunes as "Going for the One," "Turn of the Century,""Owner of a Lonely Heart," and many more, viewers will feel the full impact of the classic live performance set against the backdrop of a new stage design by none other than Roger Dean himself.
