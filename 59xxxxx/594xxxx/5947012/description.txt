I took the best quality YouTube video. Then I normalized audio, converted to 48 kHz and encoded to .ac3. For the video, I converted to uncompressed .avi and then I used de-blocking and slight noise reduction filters in VirtualDub. Then re-encoded to .264.

Overall, the quality is very excellent but not perfect. Any collector will definitely enjoy this and think it's great.

It is 100% PS3 and X-Box compatible.

video = 29.97 .264 1080p

audio = 224 kbps .ac3 @ 48 Khz

Here's a link to What's My Name that I've made with the same process, from the same SNL show:
