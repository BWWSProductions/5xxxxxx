"A Humiliating Business"

Susan begrudgingly accepts Lynette's offer to be 
baby Paige's nanny; Bree is embarrassed to tell 
Keith that she's beginning to go through menopause; 
Renee makes a tempting job proposition to Lynette; 
Gabrielle fears that Bob is trying to seduce Carlos 
after the two strike up a friendship; and Beth 
begins to question Paul's motives on the lane.

Enjoy :)
