
This heist story is one of the series' best episodes.

Although the end theme is speeded up, at 49 minutes 
the story itself is complete...unlike the 45 minute 
edited Sci-Fi Channel copies that have been circulating.

This aired on the lesser-known RTV channel and is remastered.
The alternate "Crisis" title is in place of "Suspense Theatre".

Guest Stars:  Henry Jones, Edd Byrnes, 
Larry Storch, Pat O' Brien, and Harry Bellaver.
