,OrpheusDude,2011-03-07T22:00Z,Truly one of the worst movies ever made.  Don't bother!  It's not even so bad that it's funny: just abysmally pathetic.  Download the soundtrack album: that's the only saving grace.

,Arch3bald,2011-09-30T10:15Z,Ditto what Alli Kat said to Orpheus dude;  you are a moron with your head up your ass. This is one of the best movies ever made.   
,ihtoit,2012-06-30T16:11Z,"OrpheusDude: try watching the movie. It's not a serious take on Bond (though it is faithful to the Fleming novel), it's not even an Eon production. "
