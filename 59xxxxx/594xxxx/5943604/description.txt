Ben Hull joins the team this week and is tasked with getting a business card from a car dealership and then passes to Paul in front of the marks so he can pretend to be him and tell the marks about cars that are about to be scrapped and therefore cannot be sold in the country so they give the marks four thousand pounds to buy scrapped car but Ben has switched the bags so they only get money. Jess and Paul are giving away free diamond cut shredders to shred their credit card bills and other such items unfortunately for the mark there's a scanner inside the shredder and therefore all the information goes straight to the hustlers.
