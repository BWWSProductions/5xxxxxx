,Nerd4ever,2011-02-01T14:30Z,"@Samqran, if you have the other expansion ( Majesty 2 Monster Kingdom ), just re-install it after installing this ( Majesty 2 Battles Of Arcania ) it should work by then. that's what I did, and it's working now."

It's ArDania nor ArCania"

Kingmaker
Battle of Ardania
Monster Kingdom
(which is the releases order)
worked for me, Windows 7 SP 1"
