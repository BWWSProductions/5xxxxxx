Plot:

When there is peace in the kingdom, and nothing has happened in a month, any good King would itch for war. And even if not a full scale war, then at least for a skirmish and if there is no skirmish, then at least itâ€™s time to go hunting. And if the game is a werewolf, then well â€“ thatâ€™s a sure cure for boredom

But what started as a hunt may grow into a skirmish and a skirmish may yet develop into a fullscale war. Or maybe the Adviser is exaggerating as always and all youâ€™ll have to face is a few minor problemsâ€¦ But no, deep in the darkness there prowls a mysterious mage-werewolf, who unites hordes of monsters to pose a hairy, scary threat to Ardania. Could it be that some ancient enemy, or his heirs, has returned to reclaim his domain? To overcome this menace, the Great King must draw upon all his skills, all the wisdom of his advisor, as well as the powers of an unexpected ally
