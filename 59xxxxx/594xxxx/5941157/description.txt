Here is World Of Goo for MacOSX and Debian/Ubuntu

I have personally tried both of these and they work fine.


Files Inlcluded:


WorldOfGoo.1.30.dmg
WorldOfGooSetup.1.41.deb


I chose the .deb because there is already the tar.gz and that can be hard for new users to linux to install.

Enjoy :)
