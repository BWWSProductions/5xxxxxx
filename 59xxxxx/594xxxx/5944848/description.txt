 Ghulam means a slave. Sidharth is an amateur         
 boxer who does not work, preferring to loaf          
 about with friends. His older brother Jai works      
 with a gangster who rules the neighborhood,          
 terrorizing merchants and demanding protection money.
 As a child Sidharth idolized his father, an          
 ex-freedomfighter, whom he saw committing suicide    
 in guilt after a visit from an old acquaintance.
 Sidharth meets a girl, Alisha who rides         
 a motorcycle gang, and Hari, a social worker.   
 The film tells the story of Sidharth's romance  
 with Alisha and his reformation.
