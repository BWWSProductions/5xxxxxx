"It's the Great Pancake, Cleveland Brown"

Cleveland crushes Cleveland Jr.'s spirit when he 
forbids him from trick-or-treating because he 
thinks he is too old. Junior reinvents himself as 
a "cool kid" and is invited to attend a Halloween 
party with Roberta. When Junior gets picked on and 
is unhappy with his new persona, Cleveland and the 
gang come to his rescue and encourage his 
enthusiasm for the holiday.

Now this is how Cleveland is SUPPOSED to look. 
Absolutely no background artifacting, vibrant
lively colors, perfect edge definition, and 
banding ONLY where it exists on the source. If
you can't do it like this, why do it all? Why
not jsut stick to your E-Z Bake Oven and leave
that crappy automated encoding tool in the
closet?

Enjoy :)
