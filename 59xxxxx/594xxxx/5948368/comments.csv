,Bean-Bandit,2010-11-16T17:08Z,Hey TvTeam have you changed the encoding on this one? For some reason now and it's only happen a few times with a few shows from you that my A.C. Ryan PlayON!HD tells me that the file is invalid. I can play it on my desktop using VLC player but not on my HD Media Player. Most of the time it's fine.
