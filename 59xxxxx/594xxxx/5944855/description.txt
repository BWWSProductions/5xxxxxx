SOURCES:

VIDEO:Russian cam and Spanish cam ......Thanks both
AUDIO:LU's ........Thanks bro ;-)

NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Due Date

Right......here we go with a FULL version on due date no missing 7mins now
For this we took the spanish release which was full and cut the scenes we needed and added them
to the russian video.
Now the spanish video looks a little clear,sharper ..however had bad angles and cropped way more so we
opted to stick with the russian video as the main body for this.
For the parts we added we had to resize the spanish video to match the res of the russian release so we could mux
it together so there is some slight AR issue when this happens.
Both videos have been filtered .......the main issues was the glares and way too much colour,so made a script to tone the
glares down and lowered the colour alot and also slightly corrected them aswell.
The audio .....well thanks to LU for sending us the full audio file so we could get this synced ;-)

Anyway Enjoy folks
