Runner Runner is an American pop rock band founded in Huntington Beach, California in 2008. They were the first band signed to ajoint venture between Capitol Records, MRV and C.E. Music a subsidiary of David Letterman's Worldwide Pants, Inc. The band's television debut was hosted by Jimmy Kimmel Live! on July 20, 2010.

Runner Runner was founded in Huntington, California by its current members, Ryan Ogren, Peter Munters, Jon Berry, Nick Bailey, and James Ulrich. The five friends came together after their previous projects, Over It, Rufio and Don't Look Down had dissolved. Their name originated from Ryan Ogren and Jon Berry's love of poker. The term, 'runner runner', loosely means to beat the odds and pull off a winning hand in the last possible moment.

They began touring with Secondhand Serenade, The White Tie Affair and split opening acts Go Radio, and Camera Can't Lie in June 2010. In August they began their first headlining tour, and will close out the year touring briefly with 2AM Club, and later, Forever The Sickest Kids. Their national television performance was hosted by Jimmy Kimmel Live! on July 20, 2010. They were also featured on The Late Show with David Letterman on September 27, 2010.

Runner Runnerâ€™s debut single, "So Obvious", has received moderate radio airplay, and appeared as a bonus "What's Next New Music Preview" on Now That's What I Call Music! 34.

Runner Runner is the upcoming debut studio album by American pop punk band Runner Runner. It is scheduled to be released on December 7, 2010, through David Letterman's record label, Clear Entertainment/C.E. Music of Capital Records.
