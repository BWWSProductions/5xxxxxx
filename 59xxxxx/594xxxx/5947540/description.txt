Plot: 
NYPD Detectives Christopher Danson and P.K. Highsmith (Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson) are the baddest and most beloved cops in New York City. They donâ€™t get tattoos â€“ other men get tattoos of them. Two desks over and one back, sit Detectives Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg). Youâ€™ve seen them in the background of photos of Danson and Highsmith, out of focus and eyes closed. Theyâ€™re not heroes â€“ theyâ€™re â€œthe Other Guys.â€ But every cop has his or her day and soon Gamble and Hoitz stumble into a seemingly innocuous case no other detective wants to touch that could turn into New York Cityâ€™s biggest crime. Itâ€™s the opportunity of their lives, but do these guys have the right stuff?
