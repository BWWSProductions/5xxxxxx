,hedwerk,2010-11-11T14:37Z,Game installed and activated via keygen ok. You cant access chapter 1 though as it asks for the serial again. Re-entering the original serial I used from the keygen (or any other serial from it) comes up as invalid and you cannot continue. Bad keygen? Needs a fix? In my case I would say this release this is nuked...

Run the game and select DEMO - DO NOT ENTER A SERIAL FROM THE KEYGEN YET!

it will give you a code. Enter that code in the keygen to gain an activation code.

And you may want to learn how to entirely unload the AV garbage. It will not protect you from viruses. They only catch OLD viruses that they have already found. Take any old virus and add a single character in between two malicious commands and it is suddenly invisible to ALL ANTIVIRAL GARBAGE.

You need to learn how to spot the bad stuff. There is NO AV program that will protect you from a determined bastard coding viruses or from yourself.

,OmniNegro,2010-11-12T20:10Z,"@hicks1992

Most here are loath to answer such questions because they are the EXACT same questions that feds would ask to build a case against people here.

I suggest you look into a program called ""Daemon Tools Lite"". And perhaps read some comments on older popular torrents like this. You will learn, and we aim to help you. But we must be cautious.

Good luck, and once you have it running, you should pay close attention to the comments left above. They may make more sense to you after you do a bit of troublesome reading. :)

AV must be unloaded entirely to avoid the lag and general slowdown that most cause. Disabling it does not always change anything other than what things it will actually tell you. It may well still be monitoring and causing problems.

I use Clamwin AV. It is freeware and open source. Once you scan something, why would you need it running in the tray?

As a general rule, do not try to be one of the first to play a game. Impatience on your part is a strong ally to anyone coding malicious stuff. Wait a few days and continue monitoring the comments. This way if anyone really runs into malware you will know about it and never run it.

This release is clean, (No virii) but it does have some issues for some people. I would give it a few more days before messing with it. 

And always support good game developers. If they do not make money making good games, they may have to go get a job asking someone if they want fries (Chips in UK I think) with that order, or much much worse, they will start making crappy games that sell well. WoW, GTA4, Two Worlds (The first one), that terrible Gothic 3/4 mess. (Gothic 3 was a great game once you use the community patch) and others are good examples of greed overriding common sense.. Buy the game if it works and you like it.

This is already too long. I will shut up now. Be well and enjoy!"

Perhaps I am simply misunderstanding, but how could you try the ""post demo keygen thing even though it worked without having to""?

Why the fuck can you not do it like hedwerks says? Oh, because trolls can not follow simple instructions?

Fucking uninstall it and THEN delete your profile directory. (Google will tell you how if you are retarded)

Then install and follow what hedwerks said to the letter.

If you really can not manage this then you should uninstall the game, repackage your computer in the original box, take it back to whereever you bought the system and tell them you are too dumb to use a computer.

IF for some reason you are really unable to do this, then do not be upset at my rude comments. Be upset at yourself for telling us NOTHING that can allow us to help you.

Let me be clear. We MUST know what OS you are using. Not just ""Windows"". We need to know WHAT VERSION of Windows.

We need to know what hardware you have.

We need to know EXACTLY what you have tried and EXACTLY what the results are. 

Tell us this first. Then and only then will I apologize for being a jerk and try to help you. (Help you more)

,OmniNegro,2010-11-13T07:42Z,"@sharmila123

Sorry. I somehow missed your post while I was being a jerk to others. 

No. It will simply not work. I guess I presumed you would have learned that yourself by the fact that the system requirements say it requires a ""128 MB VRAM Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â£ NVIDIA GeForce FX 5600 / ATI Radeon 9500
"".....

That means it will NOT work without a video card. And it will not work well with the cheaper video cards too. 

Despite the system requirements, if you want it to look good and play well, you really need a modern graphics card. Something with Shader Model 3 at least.

I am sorry I disregarded your question. Does this answer all your questions?

(And I am sorry that you feel that your country is the reason we disrespect you. I have nothing against the so-called third world. I wish the best for you and wish I could make this work out too. But I can not.)

Without a real video card you are very very limited in what games you can play. I advise you look into Rougelikes. They have all the depth and detail and story that you could ever desire, but simple character graphics.

Google will tell you about them. Search Google for Angband and Furyband. They are great games and you CAN play them.

I wish the best for you."

,OmniNegro,2010-11-13T19:18Z,"@sharmila123

No-one here will use your e-mail. That is why these comments exist. We all benefit from the discussion. That is a bad practice too. Do not give out your e-mail address. You will get loads of spam by doing that.

Also, I tend to ignore where people get this from. My concern is helping people to make it work. There are guilds that will tell you how to configure utorrent. You just have to search to find them.

I know I am being somewhat evasive, but that is required. If I told you direct answers to some of your questions I could later find that comment being used against me in a court of law.

Also, to possibly give a different answer on a previous question, what Nvidia chipset? I must have misunderstood your earlier comment. I am glad to hear you do have a GPU, although in a laptop you will likely have to play on low graphical settings anyway.

But it IS possible that you can play this. And we are all glad to help.

Be patient. Sometimes I take a nap during the day. If I seem to be ignoring you, that may also mean I have to spend some time researching something to give you a good answer.

(I sometimes have to research the laws to find out what I can and can not tell you. I sometimes have t research the hardware and software you have to find out if it will work and if it will even be playable with that. The system requirements seem a bit low, I suspect they are plainly lying about what it will run on.)

Like most Indians, you seem an intelligent and reasonable person. (As a general rule, never tell anyone your ISP or where you live. That is nearly as bad for you as giving out your e-mail address) 

You will manage to get it working. (If possible) We will help you!"

,OmniNegro,2010-11-13T20:57Z,"@Igliu

What firewall are you using? If none, or the joke that is called the Windows firewall, then get Comodo. It is free and works wonders. 

Set the Firewall Security level to ""Custom Policy Mode"" and set Defense+ Security level to Disabled and set the Sandbox Security level to Disabled.

Now to actually block the executable... I can not tell you how verbosely due to legal issues. Google will tell you how to do this in general, and if you have a mind you will easily figure it out. 

If you actually manage to run into problems with that, try asking Google first and then come here. We will help, but you simply MUST learn how to do this for future applications that need to be blocked. (There are many)

Good luck and be well."

,visaporr69,2010-11-13T21:50Z,RELOADED. Please release a real executable crack and not a keygen crap that doesn't work... couldn't get past chapter I. 
,OmniNegro,2010-11-14T02:11Z,"Now for a general comment. This may hep all of you still having problems with the keygen.

A keygen does exactly that. It does not crack the executable for the game. Even using the cracked executable does not make it magically work if you have internet access and are dumb enough to allow it access.

YOU MUST BLOCK THE EXECUTABLE!!!!

This is the case for ALL cracked games.

If your game can access the internet then it will quickly check the serial you enter and find that it is not valid.

If firewalls and access rights and such things are too much for you to figure out how to learn then UNPLUG your computer from the router/modem. This will entirely remove internet access from the ENTIRE computer. 

If at any time you start the game with internet access allowed for the system and game then it WILL NOT WORK!

Anyone still having issues, please verify that you do not have iexplorer.exe running in the background. It can sometimes be used by applications like this to bypass firewall restrictions.

To spell it out: If Internet explorer can access the internet, then some programs can simply ask IE to do the serial check for them. I do not know if this is one of them yet."
,OmniNegro,2010-11-14T02:14Z,"And one more thing. If you have EVER allowed it to access the internet, it likely will NEVER work until you uninstall and delete your entire profile directory for the game.

Do you have a supported GPU? Do you bother to read the system requirements? Bother to tell us your hardware and what OS and read through the comments first. THEN we may have some chance of helping you.

Good luck though."
,OmniNegro,2010-11-16T19:19Z,"@sharmila123

I will only ever answer this ONE more time. This time.

You must block the game via a firewall.

If you do not, then it will use the internet to connect to the game maker's site and report what serial you tried to use and report your IP address as well.

This is the case in ALL cracked games. Sometimes the crack itself is a scam to get internet access for a virus. This is not the case here though. This game does not require internet access. Therefore you should NEVER let it have internet access.

I am unable of thinking of another way to say the same damned thing with different words.

@Everyone

Follow the instructions given by sOuLrEapER13.

Clearly he is capable of reading. And since he laid it all out for you there should be no issues.

,OmniNegro,2010-11-17T02:47Z,"@Phantom1412
You say you have read the comments. Yet you can not follow the simple instructions given multiple times in the comments?

You use the Phone Activation without ever touching a phone. Does that clarify it a bit? How about this.... USE THE KEYGEN! It Does Work. Sometimes it generates a key that will not work. When it does, generate another! You can change the entire key to whatever the new key is.

If this does not help you to figure it out, ask a friend who knows computers well to take a look at it. Sometimes another pair of eyes will see something that we miss.

Do not feel bad. We all miss things from time to time. And others rarely if ever understand how we manage to miss simple things.

You will get it. Hang in there."

@rpgboyuk

you have to allow the keygen through your antivirus or it will automatically quarantine the file not allowing you to have ""permission."" I'm not exactly sure how to do it through AVG. I use the microsoft security essentials and I was able to allow it through and open it.

Also anyone that is worried if they're firewall/antivirus is spotting a virus/trojan in this torrent is because some keygens are flagged that way because its technically what they are, just not malicious to your computer."

1)  Open the keygen from the ISO.
2) Click ""generate"".
3) copy full serial with ctrl-c on my keyboard
4) alt tab back into the game and paste with ctrl-v.

The first few serials did not work. I did this about 4-5 times and it finally accepted and asked me to register by phone. You know what to do next.

First you don't actually ring up, you use a serial from the keygen, then choose to activate via phone then type the phone code into the keygen and it will give you another number which you enter and it will activate."

A lot of keygens use the same type of algorithms as trojans so they tend to get mixed up.  You can disable your antivirus programs or if you are paranoid about running keygens that get flagged as trojans (like I am) you can download sandboxie ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5668749/Sandboxie_3.46_Final___serial_-TrT )  and run it under a sandbox.  Sandboxie runs the program in its own memory compartment so it won't effect your computer.  You may still need to disable your antiviruses even if you run sandboxie.

,chowp,2010-11-25T18:42Z,"remedy2, if you are talking about the blackscreen then i encountered it also. It's a known problem. I got around it by saving before i talk to someone important and restarting which usually clears it up. I also encountered it at the end of the game and had to play through 2 times before the cutscenes would play.

There is also a hotfix out that suppose to fix it so you should try that."

When did you enter it the first time? You should start playing the demo up until chapter 1 when it will ask you for serial, then you use the generator included and copy paste the serial, then you chose phone activation and copy paste the code you get from the game into the middle field in the generator and press the second generate button. That should give you the activation code to copy paste into the game.

If you do that from the start, instead of play through the demo part first it wont work. Didn't for me. But the way I described seems to work so far."

Please do not read any of the other comments..
This file is fine it has everything you need, no need to be downloading other cracks and following stupid long winded instructions.

1. Download Torrent
2. Mount or burn ISO File (I Use MagicISO)
3. Install Game
4. Play Game until it askes you for a serial, Open keygen application located in the crack folder of your ISO file,
5. Hit Generate Serial Number (top box only)
6. Enter Serial Number that has generated and leave this program OPEN
7. Play the game some more until it askes for registration click ""Phone Registration""
8. The GAME will offer you an ""activation code"" on screen, copy this code into the SECOND box including the dashes between every 4 letters of your Keygen program that is still open and click the Generate Button on the BOTTOM this time.
9. Enter the code given into the game and your done.
10. If ever pompted again in any other sections of the game simply do steps 8 - 10 again using watever activation code the game gives you.

,woowahweewah,2011-02-14T07:29Z,"I was playing game for quite a while. Simultaneously updated drivers to 11.1a, and applied the 1.2 patch. One day it randomly asks for the key and starts crashing.
I have uninstalled, deleted registry files, save files, any game files, re-installed drivers, latest physx, and directx from cd.
Soon as it starts up it asks for the key, after entering access code it crashes big time, have to restart. If I apply the patches and then run the game, it crashes after going to the enter serial screen within seconds. 
I have the .exe blocked in my firewall and allowed in my a/v. I have tried with internet unplugged.

,Saerain,2011-02-17T17:02Z,"For those concerned about the false positive on the crack, as well as those whose security software deleted the crack or blocked its download, give this a shot:

Serial Number: Y8TE-CH4G-RN4P-XUSH
Activation Request: 3232-3189-9300-3256
Activation Code: 1853-7493-7233-2193"
,Saerain,2011-02-17T17:05Z,"Also, it is very important that you block the game using Windows Firewall with Advanced Security.

1. In Windows 7, type ‘firewall’ into your start menu search and choose ‘Windows Firewall with Advanced Security’.

2. Set inbound and outbound rules to block TwoWorlds2.exe"
,Whobuysgames,2011-02-19T04:03Z,anything on a 1.4 crack?
,desertlizard,2011-02-20T18:38Z,"TIP: To reset the serial, you don't have to uninstall the whole game. Instead, you can do this:

XP users:
1. open regedit
2. browse to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Reality Pump\TwoWorlds2\SerialKey
3. delete that entire key and its subkeys
4. done, the game will ask a serial next time you launch it

When is this useful? When the chapter changes and it doesn't accept your old key. Just create a new serial and ""activate"" the game again with a new key. If you chose to ""Save and quit"" when the chapter changed, you won't be prompted for a key when you load that save, assuming you've just activated the game. Sadly you'll probably have to do this between every chapter but it's no big deal IMO."

For those experiencing a problem with the cut-scenes not playing, try disabling the game's HD Video setting. if that doesn't work, then install the Klite Codec pack (32 or 64 bit, whatever one you're using) and then install the Klite Mega Codec Pack.

1) generate code from KEygenerator
2)Paste in game and do Phone activation
3) Take new code given from phone activation in game and paste it in ""Activation key"" in the middle slot in keygenerator program(Use dashes)
4) CLick verify in keygen and code will popup in bottom
5)Paste new that code in the final area to complete phone registration without any hassle. Do in this order while not clicking ""generate"" more than once or else you have to redo it.

This file contains the crack and the keygen and got a clean bill of health when scanned and when run.

Activation failed the first few times around for me, so here's what I tried, in case anyone else has trouble:

*Disabled game in firewall
*Tried the first two codes, failed.
*Disabled my lan port went to activate later, then went back into product activation (perhaps my success was based on the difference between the game start activation screen and the revisit activation button that the crack was built for, dunno)
*Clicked through 10-15 times to generate a later key in the keygen
*Clicked validate before typing anything (not sure if that was a factor, but throwing it in there, in case it was something screwy with the keygen)
*Hit the phone activation button after entering the generated key
*Entered code in keygen
*Hit validate again
*Entered validated code
*Success

1) If the keygen is not working for you, download this keygen""http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5955798/Two_Worlds_2_Keygen_Fix-RELOADED"" and REMEMBER to put down the exact Phone Activate number include ""-"" into the keygen for example (2222-1111 ...etc)..without the ""-"" the activate code doesn't work.
2) Use this method if the game ask for the key again till chapter 3 something: 
You Go Into The Registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Reality Pump\TwoWorlds2\SerialKey
& Change The Registered To 0, When You Load The Save Before It Alerts You To Re-enter The Key, You Can Use The Normal Keygen Method

Please comment if this works :D thank you all

,morbec,2011-05-31T21:58Z,"Hello Guys

This torrent is working great but it took me arround 2 hours to fix it to make it work,
so here it is I hop it will save you time:

1. First the game is missing 3 dll so download them here:
physxloader.dll -> http://www.down-dll.com/index.php?file-download=physxloader.dll
x3daudio1_7.dll -> http://www.down-dll.com/index.php?file-download=x3daudio1_7.dll
xaudio2soundengine.dll -> http://www.down-dll.com/index.php?file-download=xaudio2soundengine.dll
2. Once you download them extract them in your c:\windows\system32 folder
3. Start the game as ""admin"" otherwise it will not start.

After all that it should work fine."

,newmouse,2011-06-26T03:45Z,"I have had the problem with Two Worlds II repeatedly asking for the serial nearly every time its run.
Its disabled in the Firewall.
This DOESN'T happen if my Internet Connection is switched off.

I've decided that the game looks for a active Internet connection  & try's to verify the Serial.
If it doesn't find an active connection then it excepts the Serial as OK.
That is, it rejects the Serial just because it can' t verify it when the Game thinks it should be able to.
The only solution I have found that works & completely stops the activation requests is 
to edit Windows HOSTS file adding the entry 
""127.0.0.1       secure.zuxxez.com"" 
Just disabling TWII in the Firewall isn't enough.

You will have to Google around about working with that HOSTS file ...to complicated to detail here. @@@@  "

You must learn to BLOCK the program in the firewall. I tried just unchecking the program in the list of firewall programs, and that did NOT work.

Here is how you manually block a file in Windows 7:

1. Go to control panel (full view).
2. Click on Windows Firewall.
3. Click on Advanced Settings.
4. Click on Outbound Rules.
5. Click on New Rule to the right.
6. Select Program and click next.
7. Browse for the exe (in this case TwoWorlds2.exe in the install folder) and click open.
8. Click next, and make sure ""Block the connection"" is chosen. Click Next twice, and enter a name (e.g. Two Worlds). Finish.

9. If you want to be extra sure repeat steps 5-8 in the Inbound Rules tab as well.

10. Play. If you last quit the game after being prompted to put in a new serial and do the phone activation, you will probably have to do it one last time, but after that it will stick."

Activating the game seems to work fine, and I'm allowed to play past chapter one. Then it suddenly keeps asking for the serial again. Again and again and again...

Just run the game instead.

Minimize your game and generate a serial form rld-tw2k.exe.
Then register via phone.
A code will be shown, just insert the code into the keygen and hit Generate.
Copy the code and type in game.
And you're done.
