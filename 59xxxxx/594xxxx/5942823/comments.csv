,Imastonedmuslim,2011-08-04T12:56Z,"If it doesn't run it means your computer isn't good enough, The example of it proving your computer isn't good enough is when it opens up for around 2 seconds and closes instantly. :)"
,korobug,2011-08-18T20:51Z,"Love how you just jump to that conclusion Ima.
No, you may be able to run it, it could mean you need a better computer, but it could also be a crash.  Try to find the log for game in its folder and grab your system specs at the same time."

Well you can try one of this, a bit older then shank but still epic games. 
Zombie Smashers X
Zombie Smashers X2: Punx and Skins

And there is one other, Surviving Crisis Z. Mostly from Ska studios. 


have fun playing "

,Ears14U,2012-02-07T20:13Z,"Strange, but I've downloaded many many torrents with a successful result as this: Go into your UTorrent options/setup guide, and reset your location. I'm d/ling about 1.2 megs a second due to the reset. Sometimes Utorrent doesn't save your settings like it says it does. Just FYI. Thanks for the torrent me_blindly!"
,Gore_Juice,2012-02-14T01:03Z,Can't get it to save progress = have to start back to the beginning everytime i close the prog... Anyone has an idea??
