- Big Business & Arms Deals, Not Poverty, Top Obama's Agenda in India

President Obama rounded off his 3-day visit to India today by addressing a special joint session of both houses of India's Parliament. Accompanied by some 250 business executives, the President's visit to India is part of a 10-day tour of Asia to boost U.S. exports. Meanwhile a number of groups are protesting Obama's visit to India, including some Left political parties, survivors of the 1984 deadly Bhopal disaster, and the families of cotton farmers who committed suicide, partly as a result of U.S. agricultural subsidies.


- Hundreds of Survivors of Bhopal Disaster Protest Obama India Visit

A group of 400 survivors of the Bhopal disaster have been protesting Obama's visit to India. The 1984 Bhopal industrial gas disaster left an estimated 15,000 people dead. The company, Union Carbide, is now a subsidiary of Dow Chemical. Dow has faced calls to clean up the contaminated site, increase compensation for victims, and fund studies to assess damages to the environment and public health. India has also demanded the extradition of former Union Carbide CEO Warren Anderson, who fled India shortly after his arrest in the disaster's aftermath.

Indian authorities have raised questions about why the United States overlooked repeated warnings about Headley's terrorist activities and point to his connections to both American law enforcement as well as Pakistani intelligence officials.
