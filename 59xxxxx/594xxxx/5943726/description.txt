"I Know Who You Are"

President Martinez (Blair Underwood) orders 
Director of National Intelligence, Blake 
Sterling (eljko Ivanek), to root out the 
mole from their staff, which causes 
Sterling to question his judgment of people 
close to him. Sophia (Laura Innes) 
reasserts her power over Thomas (Clifton 
Collins, Jr.) and the other detainees, and 
she prepares them for the next leg of their 
mission. Elsewhere, with the aid of 
Madeline (guest star Paula Malcomson), Sean 
(Jason Ritter) continues his hunt for 
answers, all the while trying to stay one 
step ahead of the covert agents who trail 
him.

Enjoy :)
