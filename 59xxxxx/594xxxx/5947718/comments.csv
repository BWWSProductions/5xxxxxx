I love the way they showed Jack's passing.
It is the way we would like to see ourselves go when the time comes.
It was also good how they showed  how people react when someone goes.
So tastefully done.
I hope this is as tasteful. and not morbid."
,smartchick_95,2010-11-14T01:44Z,"this was really good. good to see the old cast members too. and to know why Jack has left.
It is better that they choose to leave rather then just being killed off to increase ratings.
we did enjoy this and will be keeping this to watch again in the future."
