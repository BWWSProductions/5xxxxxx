Full length videos on various scientific aspects of nature, physics, biology, chemistry, and quantum physics, portrayed in a way to a suggest a strong argument for creation. 

Although the videos are muslim based, any audience should appreciate the science in these. 
If you are not a muslim, or religious, 99.9% of the footage is still extremely intriguing (so long as you are not an avid atheist or darwin fan). The only religious connotation is a brief .. 'And this is thanks to God / Allah ' ... but the videos themselves are presented mainly in the form of modern science, which should be just as amazing if you donâ€™t have any religious beliefs. 

These videos are taken from the Harun Yahya website. 

Although you can download all these videos from the site, they total to approx. 34 GB, and have various issues, which i feel i have fixed, which makes for a better viewing experience, whilst halving the amount of storage area required (under 18GB total). 

I have cropped, and chopped the unnecessary various black borders that appear during each video, as footage sources change. 
There were many, which had crazy unnecessary high bitrates (higher than HD), which was certainly not appropriate for the quality and resolution of the video. I have reduced the bitrates accordingly. 
I have de-interlaced the video. 

My upload is not the fastest, so i ask you please be patient, as I suspect there will never be lots of seeders at any one time. 

VLC Player WILL play all of the videos contained here. 


Enjoy.
