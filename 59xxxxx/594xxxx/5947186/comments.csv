i use AVG how would i do that?"
,masterfaster2,2010-11-10T18:48Z,Just remove the cable from the phone line outlet to disable internet. After activation you can plug in again the cable in phone line outlet.
,Angelo85,2010-11-10T18:58Z,"Thanks for the upload!
Can somebody post a couple of genereated serials for the paranoid of us who won't execute the keygen?"
,Pk__,2010-11-10T19:26Z,Is this also for OSX?
,VeteranD13,2010-11-10T19:36Z,Thanks!
,nymac11,2010-11-11T19:44Z,dont dload keygen only works for first level then you have to burchase a new one!
,hedwerk,2010-11-11T20:14Z,"Nymac 11 - It DOES work.

Heres the deal to get into chapter 1 and beyond.
Uninstall the game deleting all your save profiles and settings. (you can back these up and paste them in after if you wish)
Install the game as usual.
Block in firewall access to two worlds two.
Run the game and select DEMO - DO NOT ENTER A SERIAL FROM THE KEYGEN YET!
Play the game as usual until it asks for a serial.
ALT TAB out and open the keygen and get a serial
Tab back into the game and enter it.
Choose Phone activation
it will give you a code. Enter that code in the keygen to gain an activation code.
Enter that activation code and voila!

if you wish to use your old saves then paste them back in.

have fun!

shame the nfo didnt state the correct instructions. "

,dgkresge,2010-12-19T06:57Z,"worked fine for me.
whenever it askes for a serial just go to the keygen (not a trojan, same coding as a trojan for all the noobs) do the whole phone activation thing and type in the code they give you into the keygen to get the validation code then enter it and viola"
