A reference for the beverage, fuel and industrial alcohol industries.

This book has been written to fill a void in the scientific literature available for distillers. For twenty three years a short course has been held, in Kentucky, each year, for alcohol distillery managers and chemists. This course has been directed towards the fermentation and distillation of ethyl alcohol (ethanol) for all sectors concerned with this product, including fuel, beverage and industrial alcohol producers.

Over the years, the course has established a core group of lecturers with international reputations. This has led students from all over the world to congregate annually in Kentucky for this course, and there has been an ever-increasing demand for a textbook for the course, covering all aspects of the production of alcohol by fermentation and distillation.

With this aim in mind, the lecturers at the Alcohol School and other world-renowned experts, have produced a textbook that can be used for course participants and members of the alcohol-distilling community in general.

The book has been integrated with a common overall theme and is intended to meet the needs of all levels in the industry, thus making useful and vital information generally accessible, and to make the technical language understandable.
