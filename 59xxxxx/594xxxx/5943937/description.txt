Here 's the Monday night game PGH Steelers v. Cincy Bengals. The recording is from analog cable with a crappy res, some snow in the picture and commercials left in. 

If you wish to complain about the quality, commercials or anything else, here's a suggestion: save yourself the aggravation and don't DL it. 

The rest of you, enjoy!
