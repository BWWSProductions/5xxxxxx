,SirReno8,2010-11-09T07:10Z,"Thanks very much for this..  And no, I'm NOT going to complain about the quality of it..  I'm just really GRATEFUL for it..  I'm from Pittsburgh, but currently in Detroit, on some work-related business..  JUST got off work, around 12:30AM, and saw that this was ALREADY POSTED (about 14 minutes before I got on this website)..  I don't get to see many Steelers games on the local networks while I'm in Detroit, and I don't have ESPN..  So I'm REALLY STOKED that you posted this so fast..  This game JUST ended (like, literally MINUTES AGO, at the time of my typing this)..  I purposely AVOIDED any score updates on the radio while I was at work, so the results would not be spoiled for me.  Now I'm about to watch it, as soon as my download is complete (except there aren't many seeds yet, because this is still NEW, but I WILL seed it for OTHERS, when it finishes).  I'm very HAPPY to get a chance to see my team play -- even WITH commercials, and fuzz..  I thank you VERY MUCH."

My husband and I are Steelers fans living abroad, so our only chance to see games comes from the kindness of uploaders like yourself.  Thanks so much for hooking us up!!  (And we're actually glad to have commercials in the broadcast...we've been away from the US for almost 4 years....I MISS the commercials!!)  =)"
