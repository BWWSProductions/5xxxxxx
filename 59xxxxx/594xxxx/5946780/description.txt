Jim (Brendan Cowell) is a thirty-something, emotionally stunted man who works at a miniature railway, and refuses to grow up. He is unable to make a commitment to his girlfriend of three years, Alice (Yvonne Strahovski), who is very disappointed that Jim can't tell her that he loves her. Hoping to drive her boyfriend into saying those magical words, she considers taking a job in England, but to no avail.
After a drunken night on the town with his mate Blake (writer Peter Helliar), Jim attempts to steal a car, where he meets the vertically challenged Charlie (Peter Dinklage), who is obsessed with supermodel Francesca Moretti (Megan Gale). In order to get Charlie to help him with Alice, he agrees to get Charlie in touch with Moretti. Meanwhile, Jim's pregnant sister Marie (Bridie Carter) struggles with her oafish brute of a husband, Owen (Travis McMahon).
