Pittsburgh, PA 1996
Date: 96-07-22
Venue: Civic Arena

Recording: AUD
Quality: 8(-)
Menu: NO
Extras: None
Comments: Single cam on the balcony stage right. Fairly well-shot with a steady cam (and what almost looks like digital zooms after the fact). Picture quality has suffered a bit from one too many VHS generations so it's saturated and lacking in detail. Audio is good although it's a bit distant and lacking in bass.
