Philadelphia
Date: 96-10-08
Venue: CoreStates Center

Recording: AUD
Quality: 9(+)
Menu: NO
Extras: None
Comments: Single cam high on the balcony stage right. Well-shot and with excellent picture quality (straight from the master). Audio is a little uneven in quality (muffled at first, then with better highs) and has the big venue sound so it's a little unfocused. A very good bootleg.
