CBT Nuggets - CCNA Certification Videos + Material [2010][GuruFuel]


Here is a 2 disk interactive study guide that will help you ace the CCNA Certification test. This is one I have personally used and recommended multiple times in the past. CBT Nuggets are very long, but in depth videos that cover EVERYTHING in the Certification test. If you are serious, and ready for this certification, this is the torrent for you. 

No body has time to download eBooks and read for 5 months, watch videos and examples in front of you so you know you understand whats going on.
