Midwesterner Ike Reilly attacks like a cross between Loudon Wainwright III, Dan Bern, and Bare Jr. on this debut disc. A wiseass singer-songwriter with an agenda--the title comes from the CD\'s opener, \"Last Time,\" and damns racist jokes while playing with a handful of epithets fast and loose like Lenny Bruce would--Reilly spits and howls like a less-focused Bern. Sometimes scattershot to the point of incomprehensibility, begging the question of whether anyone still finds the word commie funny--that\'s Ike, brother. With a fairly hard-hitting band behind him, though, he can convince you that he truly believes that \"no limey ever made nothin\' like \'I Walk the Line.\'\" You could call the best songs here shock value with a heart; when Reilly tips the balance for a rare feel-good moment (\"Put a Little Love in It\"), it\'s hardly as affecting as when he mourns the death of a relationship as a \"God Damn Shame.\" Reilly\'s artistry is still developing, but the best moments here arouse curiosity about just how good he might turn out to be.
