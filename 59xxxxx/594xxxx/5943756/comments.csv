,scottsasse,2010-11-18T03:07Z,Is it just the psychotic ingrate's who watch this show that don't say THANK YOU or are people who download your other torrents equally ungrateful?? I don't mean to sound self-rightous by any means. I just hope people realize that most torrents are uploaded by people who get nothing in return except for an occasional THANK YOU!!
