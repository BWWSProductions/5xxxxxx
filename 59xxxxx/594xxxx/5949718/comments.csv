[T],[D],2010-12-18T10:22Z,"VLC doesn't support  ordered chapters. Use media player classic with haali splitter and coreflac. 100% tested and working perfectly. Another solution is mplayer, but special builds with ordered chapters support."
,MaximilianK1,2010-12-31T06:10Z,Can more people please seed? Thank you. 
,koudepinda,2011-01-20T21:21Z,could u upload the second season in the same quality too??
,kithylin,2011-03-04T18:10Z,"All files in this torrent come up as ""Unable to render file"" in media player classic (both 32-bit and 64-bit) VLC Player will not open them, either, it tries and then comes up with ""Unable to play file"".

Don't bother downloading these, they don't work."
,koudepinda,2011-03-08T12:49Z,"bullshit, they work just fine. even with mpc 64bit."
,plofky,2011-03-13T20:41Z,"Thanks D!  I had copies of MSG 00 I couldn't watch on VLC for months because of it's ""ordered chapters"".  MPC was the perfect fix : )"
,supportkiller,2011-04-16T17:10Z,can you give a step by step explenation how you get this to work with subtitles?
,Zetack,2011-04-30T03:51Z,"You can also play this with VLC by running

""C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe"" --no-mkv-use ordered-chapters

in cmd (WITH quotes(important!!) and if you have installed your vlc somewhere else you have to use that path then)."
,joben62,2011-07-23T02:23Z,"I am having trouble working with these files.  I wanted to convert them as I usually do to MPEG4 format for use in tablet/smartphone.  Crashes handbrake every time.  No sure why, as no other 264 encoded videos I have do that.

I tried to demux the files and TSMuxer only recognizes the video stream, but not the audio or the subtitles.  MKVExtract doesn't see anything.  Ripbot264 hangs when trying to load it in.  I've pretty much tried everything and can't do anything with these videos.

I also wanted to remux these onto a BD-25 disc, but no go on that, since all of my tools seem to not like this.

Can the uploaded/encoder comment on anything different going on with these MKVs?  It'd be a shame for me to have downloaded these massive files that I can't do much with! :)"
,Evilution,2011-09-02T06:13Z,"DonÂ´t know how to put them on a BD-25, but the reason ""normal"" programs donÂ´t like these must be because all episodes use the 2 smaller .mkv-files for intro and outro.
My MPC skips playing the intro and outro completely, but with ZoomPlayer they work flawlessly, you can pause, and skip and jump in them. The file only restarts if you switch between ""Holo preview voice/Craft preview voice"""
,Telegraphon,2011-09-03T10:43Z,"Thanks [D], your Awesome! 

Will you upload season 2 also? 
If so, please let me know =)"
[T],[D],2012-01-20T10:13Z,No season 2 from me.
