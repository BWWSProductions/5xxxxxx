,Shoobox,2010-11-24T22:17Z,"@mgcg88
imma dissagree with you,
globes work has turn to sh!t,
his rips don't play his crappy converted down video's half the time, and he uses skidrows original files in his rips, which most of the owrk was done, all he does is convert down the video size with a arc file, nothing more,
globe is not a true ripper."
