This game is a nice rpg game and now with a new story included , i leave it really complete game with voices for not getting any user disappointed with that and it is the next thing : one thing that the executable of this game have and it was like that on the first edition is the curiosity that it is an executable without any icon what gives to the executable a kind of strange look beside the fact that works really fine , so i decided put my hands on this executable and search a safe way to include an icon on the executable like it happens with any normal executable , to give to him a more common and normal look and i did it with success in a light way very soft and working normal with the game too beside the incorporation of the icon , i am telling this because many times after the incorporation of an icon in a non-icon executable , the executable can really not work , you can say : but i donÂ´t understand this , why an included icon can cause trouble on the executable ? i canÂ´t see how an icon can interfere with the normal work of the executable , i mean , it is just an icon for god sake ... but the true is that is needed some carefull and appropriate tools to include the icon in a safe way in a non-icon executable , i have to say that because i tried a few times without success before getting the executable running ok with an icon but this is only talk between me and the general possible users , ok enough talk , copy or write the next link in succession to the address bar (17 mb) , this is an OPTIONAL file , to get the executable with an icon , after getting him just substitute on the game folder :

note : this comment happen in sequence of getting 3 negative votes that don´t make sense because i have only a couple of users for the moment with the game , this is from guys with no scrupples trying to perturbate my work no matter what because they don´t do nothing useful for himselfs and they know that is a perfect work for this game that i have in here and they are trying to dissimulate the file like not really good or something , GO FOUL YOUR MAMAS , MORRONS !!! AND LEAVE THE USERS OF MY FILES ALONE WITH A REALLY VALID OPTION FOR THIS GAME ."

,RockDeviI,2012-02-11T12:58Z,Does this download either have the crash after first cutscene or the crash when entering a door error? because both versions i downloaded from other uploaders had either of those 
,RockDeviI,2012-03-08T22:33Z,Seed please !! I have trouble finding a working version of this game and uploads by Globe usually work fine for me xP 
,RockDeviI,2012-03-10T19:12Z,"Ugh!! this doesnt work either, it crashes right after the first cutscene, right before character creation :( like it does with every version i downloaded"
