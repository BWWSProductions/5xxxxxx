Many thanks - and impressive collection of kit you have!"
[T],insinuendo,2010-11-10T21:18Z,Did you rip this?
[T],rjordan21,2010-11-10T21:31Z,"Angri1... your welcome, my pleasure.  It's been years of slow upgrades.

insinuendo.... if it was someone else's rip I would have given them the credit as that seems to be the respectful/honest thing to do.  It's mine."
[T],insinuendo,2010-11-10T22:08Z,"Just checkin'. 

Asides the continuous, yet tolerable surface noise, I must say I am pleasantly surprised. 

Nice work!"
