Length:13 hrs and 36 mins
------------------

\\\\\\\"The Western cultures esteem analytical skills measured by IQ tests: but there is clearly more to success and happiness, even in technological societies, than IQ alone. Goleman has written one of the best books on the nature and importance of other kinds of intelligence besides our perhaps overly beloved IQ. Recommended.\\\\\\\" -Amazon.com Review
