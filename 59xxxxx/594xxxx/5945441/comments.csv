,tester1ng,2011-04-28T02:24Z,The Serial doesn't work
[V],Slickinator,2011-04-29T08:41Z,"first off the serial is built in meaning you don't need to worry about that all you have to do is the patch like 3 times takes like 10 seconds after you are done installing and again DON""T have internet on or hooked too it when installing,
and second this is not a Heet release i made this so don't give me any false crap about that i slip streamed the sp3 in to it and i added the nfo file too it as some needed a serial number but don't upgrade with this its way better if you don't,
and third since the patch is a anti WPA some anitvirus sill try and catch it as a virus trust me its safe and is a false positive thanx "
[V],Slickinator,2011-04-29T08:43Z,i have been using this for years and is on the computer i am using right now .......gives full updates and all is good just do the patch 3 times till it says restore and don't restore just close off thanx and enjoy
,Fidel999,2011-08-28T14:26Z,"I have installed it on one PC that I rebuilt and worked like a charm. All MS update worked without any problem. Thanks.

I am having some problems with another PC that I am trying to rebuilt as well.  This PC has a RAID controller, and when I do the installation, I have to press the F6 key to install some special IDE controller (RAID capable). Then I have to supply a Floppy with the drivers for this IDE controller. Up to this point everything works fine, but when the installation program start to copy some files on the disk, it's telling me that it cannot find the file ""iaStor.sys"" which is my IDE driver that was taken from my floppy and should be used to access the HD. If I skip this file, the installation fails.

Any idea how I could fix this problem? Could I add this file somewhere on the CD before I burn it?"
[V],matimike,2011-09-04T04:50Z,thanks
,donkeydick121,2011-09-09T11:00Z,"Fidel999 - I have a similar situation 2 urs.

You will have to find the missing file(s) on the net and put them onto floppy. They won't work if u put them onto the installer cd as XP expects to find them on floppy.

Nice 2 know floppies are not totally redundant these daze!!!"
