Ripped from another site.

Chapter 24 in this version is missing 4 pages worth of content, but supposedly Audible has fixed this now.
I might upload the fixed copy when i get my hands on it,
it is said it will be out this week.

Same readers as in the last book, one male, one female, both good imo.

These last 3 books are, so far, much more fun to "read" then alot of the other 11 books, warmly recommended.
