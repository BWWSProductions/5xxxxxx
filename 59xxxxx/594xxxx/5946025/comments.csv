,Just_Ask,2010-11-14T00:10Z,Just download this package Rex2.0 is inside and updates
,pointlessaskingreally,2010-12-07T17:17Z,"Hmmm, but, this isn't the full package is it, as that is over 4GB. What do you get in this 244mb pack then ?? 
Just curious before I spend 2 days downloading something that I may not require."

,hubbabubba544,2011-09-11T18:01Z,pointless it can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4562732/FSX_-_Real_Environment_Xtreme
,guidez,2011-11-02T02:40Z,"The Rex V.1 is available at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4562732/FSX_-_Real_Environment_Xtreme.

Then, open the program and make sure all items on the page are marked as ""complete"" (fsx.cfg, fsx folder location and backup) You'll understand once you see it for yourself.

When you're done you can explore a little then close the program. And run the 4 updates/patches in this torrent in order."
