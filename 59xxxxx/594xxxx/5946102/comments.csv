,wetmouse,2010-11-21T18:13Z,O'Rourke is a right-wing nutcase & it is about as funny as Glenn Beck and accurate as Sarah Palin. About 90% of what you post is worthwhile. And then there's this.
[V],rambam1776,2010-11-23T18:42Z,"For those who both DONâ€™T have their heads up their ass and who also donâ€™t lurk about waiting for me to post a new torrent just so they can dump all over it as wetmouse does, P.J. Oâ€™Rourke is a center-right humorist whose writing style is similar to Mencken or Twain. He has published 15 books, 3 of which were NY Times Bestsellers. Wikipedia lists him as most quoted living man in The Penguin Dictionary of Modern Humorous Quotations. Such quotes include â€¦â€The problem with Democrats is that they canâ€™t learn from the past, and the problem with Republicans is that they canâ€™t stop living in it.â€ He is a frequent guest on the Bill Mahar program. Apparently, to wetmouse (judging from the many comments he has left) anything that isnâ€™t screamingly left-wing is to be dismissed as insane and of no quality. Download the book and judge for yourself."

I'm a bunny hugger liberal, and PJ is hysterical.

Wetmouse - PJ strike a nerve there?
hmm. 100% of what you post is...
oh, yeah, you haven't posted anything.

,mrandrewv,2010-12-28T17:12Z,"I actually read the first part of this book, and I'm sorry guys but PJ is an idiot.

""The free market is the greatest repository of human rights that we have.""

""Healthcare reform will kill us.""

""Turks get up at 4AM so that they have more time to be lazy in.""

What the fuck man?
(not made up, read the book)

And that bullshit is in addition to the massive amount of American cock-sucking that the guy does.

Yes, some of it is quite funny, but I wanted to read it for the social commentary and that part is sorely lacking.

Now, I'm not going to say something stupid like ""you shouldn't be hosting it"". I really do support freedom of speech and I'm glad that you are exercising yours by promoting spokespeople you believe in.

But I'm gonna exercise mine by saying: this book is dildos.

And the more knoweledgeable you are about the issues PJ raises the less funny he is, because his bullshit becomes more and more obvious, and that detracts from the jokes.

See quotes above.

Anyway, carry on."
