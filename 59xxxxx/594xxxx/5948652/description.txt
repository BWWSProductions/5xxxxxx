Stable release 4.1 (April 2010) 
Operating system Windows 
Type 3D computer graphics 
License Proprietary Website www.reallusion.com/ iClone is a 3D rendering and animation software program that enables users to make 3D animated films. It is notable for being one of the very few animation softwares (the other two being Muvizu and Autodesk MotionBuilder) that use a real-time "WYSIWYG" view to let animators see the results of their work immediately. This real-time feature is enabled by using a 3D videogame engine for instant on-screen rendering.
 Other functionality includes: full facial and skeletal animation of human and animal figures; lip-syncing[2]; import of standard 3D file types including FBX; a 
timeline for editing and merging motions; a scripting language for character interaction; application of standard motion-capture files; the ability to control an 
animated scene in the same manner as playing a videogame; and the import of models from Google 3D Warehouse, among many other features. iClone is also notable for offering users royalty-free usage of all content that they create with the software, even when using Reallusion's own assets library.
 iClone is developed by Reallusion, a company that has a software development base in Taiwan and offices and training centres in the U.S. and Germany. At May 2010, the iClone software is in version 4.1.
