Do me a favor and write a comment so others know it worked for you. GalenMyra did a great job with this.

Just thought it needed to be on the psp and not just to be burnt and played on a PS1.

Spread the word to your friends that like Final Fantasy 7 this one should be a bit more challenging and a lot more fun. I will be seeding at full speed for a few months.

,judge732,2010-11-10T00:53Z,M33-6 Not working
,JIHUIN,2010-11-10T02:55Z,"Downloading it right now....after I downloaded this game I will test this on 5.50 GEN-C, 5.50 GEN-B and 5.50 GEN-D3 and feedback the result.

@TwisTtheTwitTcH : please correct me if I'm wrong...all I have to do is copy the Eboot file to the PSP memory stick under the m0:\PSP\GAME folder and there is no need to enable plugins, that's all?"
,JIHUIN,2010-11-10T05:42Z,"I already test the Disk 1 on 5.50 GEN-B and it's working good without popsloader...great job.

@judge732:
Follow this instruction to run the game.
1. Copy the folder Final Fantasy VII Hard Type Disk 1 to your memory stick.

2. Be sure to put the folder on m0:\PSP\GAME directory.

3. Now, rename the folder to FFVIID1 and this will solve your problem regarding corrupted data.

4. Do the same on folder Disk 2 and Disk 3 but be sure that you don't have the same folder name on your memory stick.

Good luck and have a nice gaming day...peace. "
,judge732,2010-11-10T08:11Z,"The problem was the old FF7 save data, deleted the old save folder now it's working fine on M33-6, Thanks :)"
,TwisTtheTwiTcH,2010-11-14T03:29Z,"To Varilion:..

Sorry about that, I don't know what happened. Each file has it's own background that shows the disk number in the top right hand corner. You'll be able to tell which disk is which once it's on your PSP. Sorry for any and all confusion.

Nice work with the PSP conversion but...

You removed the info.txt file that came with the original release and you changed the version number from ""5"" to ""Complete"". I don't know why you did that but this is not at all a complete or final version. It actually contains a pretty nasty bug relating to yuffies hp/mp.

And savegames from this version is not compatible with savegames in the latest version which means that the sooner people realize that this is not a ""complete version"" the less they have to waste their time with this version.

I appreciate your effort to bring this release to the psp, but if you do it again with the latest version please do not remove or change information. Of course you can add whatever information you want...

The latest version can be found here (PSX):

,violin7,2010-11-15T15:50Z,sorry for double post
,violin7,2010-11-18T14:41Z,"I see you've changed the version number from ""complete"" to ""6"", but it's still incorrect, this torrent is based on version 5, the one with probelms releated to clouds xp and yuffies hp/mp."
,TwisTtheTwiTcH,2010-11-20T08:35Z,"Correction made. I've enjoyed the game, sorry for the confusion I've got 5,6 & 7. I'll be uploading 7 early this week for PSP. "
