This is the definitive biography of Harvey Milk: an emotionally compelling story of the life and death of the first openly gay man to be elected to US political office. 'If a bullet should enter my brain, let it destroy every closet door'. This is the definitive biography of Harvey Milk, the man whose personal life, public career, and cold-blooded assassination mirrored the dramatic emergence of the gay community as a political power in 1970s America. It is an emotionally-charged story of personal tragedy and political intrigue, murder at City Hall and massive riots in the streets, the miscarriage of justice and the affirmation of human rights and gay hope.
