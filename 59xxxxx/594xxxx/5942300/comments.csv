,VechoWhiskey,2011-01-15T01:08Z,"seems to be working fine, and no viruses 
after reading comments before me people having trouble with this software, it's something the user is doing. it does clock up the page file in win XP 32 bit, and may on some systems give the CPU a hard time. if you have concerns start learning about your own computer you can find more Ebooks here on TPB than you can poke a stick at!
