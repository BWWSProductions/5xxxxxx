,godernst,2010-11-10T03:00Z,"Is this the full-length version?  The runtime indicated is only 165 minutes, but the link to blu-ray.com referenced states ""Note: This Blu-ray release contains the complete five-and-a-half hour version of Carlos. """
[V],-jonny-,2010-11-10T12:39Z,"I gave you the runtime, and also stated that it is the movie version. Also, if you check the blu-ray cover it clearly says ""the movie and the trilogy"". Also, the trilogy is 5.5hrs long and this file is only 6.5GB at a bitrate of 5.5mbps.

I'm impatient, but I get a lot of stupid questions. The evidence is before you."
,tbone3181,2010-11-10T14:34Z,"lol hahaha jonny you make me laugh, chopping down all these noobs and their dumb questions. will you be uploading the trilogy? im waitng for a 720p of the whole shebang. thanks in advance if you do!!!"
[V],-jonny-,2010-11-10T14:39Z,"If not me, then someone else."
[T],Robston,2010-11-11T09:33Z,"Thanks.
Jonny can you complete the initial seed please. I've seeded 200gb already and the torrent is holding at around 80% complete. :)"

I'm curious to see this theatrical cut. I've seen the longer cut and thinks its quite superb. Would love the longer cut in HD."

[V],-jonny-,2010-11-14T12:03Z,There is no predicting if a release might be available before its retail date. It could be tomorrow; it could be next month.
,Dr.Skaug,2010-11-15T02:14Z,"Hi jonny love your work. But I get a problem some of the older torrents, for days now I havent had any seeds, it like the torrent its dead, but when I look it up on piratebay it says it as 5-12 seeders.
it has been like this for 4 days now. Any ide what is worng? heared of any else with this problem?"
[V],-jonny-,2010-11-15T11:02Z,"If an older torrent seems dead, add some active trackers to it. Also, it would help if you told me which one it it."
,sev_on_tpb,2010-12-06T23:35Z,"just curious: the main file says it's 7.03 GB, instead of 6.55.  Also, there were other misc. files with Chinese characters in the name.  Any insight?  Thx."
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-12T12:35Z,"It is 6.55GB, and there's nothing wrong with Chinese filenames."
