It's The Wednesday Play: Alice in Wonderland (1966) directed by Jonathan Miller in black-and-white."
,gonflement,2010-11-10T22:01Z,Merci nemo999 pour ce partage.
,lilwoodenboy,2010-11-11T09:04Z,"Ironicus is correct:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland_(1966_TV_play)
also with Peter Sellers as the King of Hearts

dvd may be missing menu, but it plays fine and is excellent quality!

NTSC 720x480
audio AC3 192CBR 
language english, with 2nd track Dir. Commentary. 

only complaint would be it needs deinterlacing"
,lilwoodenboy,2010-11-13T02:15Z,"I've made a deinterlaced, audio-boosted XVID of this if anyone wants it?  

it looks great"
,nemo999,2010-12-12T19:24Z,"Sorry for misunderstanding. It is Alice in Wonderland from 1966. 
See rewiews at http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/40635/alice-in-wonderland/
