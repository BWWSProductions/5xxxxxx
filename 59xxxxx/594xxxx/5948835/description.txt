    Archaeologist and historian Richard Miles explores the     
    roots of one of the most profound innovations in the      
    human story - civilisation - in the first episode of an  
    epic series that runs from the creation of the first      
    cities in Mesopotamia some 6,000 years ago, to the         
    decline and fall of the Roman Empire.                     
                                                             
    Starting in Uruk, the 'mother of all cities', in          
    southern Iraq, Richard travels to Syria, Egypt,            
    Anatolia and Greece, tracing the birth and development    
    of technology and culture.
