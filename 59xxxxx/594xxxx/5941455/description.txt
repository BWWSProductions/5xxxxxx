"Resolved"

Justin suddenly takes a much more keen interest in 
Holly's recovery after a nurse (guest starring 
Odette Yustman as Annie) at the hospital catches his 
eye; Nora's fellow radio host, psychiatrist Dr. 
Karl, finds his way into Nora's heart when he helps 
Sarah and Kitty resolve some old sisterly squabbles; 
and Paige helps Kevin and Scotty find forgiveness.

Enjoy :)
