        In Italy 1994, an Italian  Journalist, Enza Massa, was at  the
        Italian National  Library in  Rome. While  she was researching
        old  texts,  Enza   discovered  a  book   titled  "NOSTRADAMUS
        VATINICIA CODE", Which dates back  to 1629. And the author  of
        the book, as  written inside of  it is said  to be "Michel  de
        Notredame".  The  book  contained  many  vivid  paintings  and
        cryptic messages.

        This TV Documentary will  follow the investigation of  how the
        manuscript came to be found  in the archives, and exactly  how
        it got there. And will also give new insight into the life  of
        Nostradamus, his relationship  with his family,  Political and
        Religious figures of his time.
