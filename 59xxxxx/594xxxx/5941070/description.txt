Set in the near future, the story centers around a family of vicious gangsters who live within an area of Japan not governed by laws called Bangaichi. Kikunosuke Abashiri (Erica Tonooka) is now attending Paradise Academy, but has lost all memory of her past other than occasional dreams of happy times with her father Daemon (Shun Sugata) and three brothers. But are they all just a figment of her imagination?

One day a new transfer student named Yuki (Maria Yoshikawa) starts getting picked on by bullies, but when Kikunosuke tries to defend her with violence she gets incapacitated by extreme headaches. It turns out Kikunosuke had been brainwashed by Principal Danjuro Namakubi (Jiro Sato) after the Abashiri family clashed with Danjuroâ€™s family a year earlier. In fact, Bangaichi had been created to jail the rest of the family while Danjuroâ€™s daughter Mademoiselle Honey (Miwa) experimented on Kikunosuke and implanted her with a mind-control chip to cancel out her violent impulses. Now that sheâ€™s essentially been tamed, will Kikunosuke ever be able to escape Danjuroâ€™s school and be reunited with her family?
