"The Sniffles"

When Hope catches a cold, Virginia goes into 
panic mode because the family doesn't have 
health insurance, so she locks Maw Maw in 
her bedroom to avoid getting sick. However, 
when Jimmy realizes that he can't afford to 
take Hope to a doctor without insurance, he 
figures out a way to secure a second job at 
the grocery store where Sabrina works.

Enjoy :)
