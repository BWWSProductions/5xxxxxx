I HATE when bands do that, it annoys the fuck out of me because I have to listen to 5-8mins of silence while im commuting on the bus or trains. I hate that so fucking much - im going to give this album 4stars out of 5 - because of the 5-8min silence. I dont buy albums to listen to fuck all for 8mins - I can just buy a cheap set of ear plugs."
