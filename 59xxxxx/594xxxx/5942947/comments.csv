,monkey2010,2010-12-05T05:40Z,"Please ""penandpike"", Alien (1979), Aliens (1986), Alien 3 (1992), Alien Resurrection (1997), in Theatrical Cut Release."
,sgleder,2010-12-28T05:57Z,"penandpike: All the subtitles included in the  Alien.vs.Predator.02.Requiem.2007.Unrated.1080p.Bluray.x264.AC3-5.1-PeN.mkv are unfortunately not in sync with the audio. 

Can you perhaps provide a fix for this please? Thanks!"
,dlectro,2011-01-03T17:20Z,"Good quality, reasonable size. IMO, more worth it than this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5878559."
,penandpike,2011-01-12T07:38Z,"Unfortunatly there is nothing I can do to fix this subtitle isue. Have no idea why they all shift in time.
you can find another sub file and mux it with mkvmerge GUI. it's easy and fast
or you can just download and rename the sub file and add it to your movie folder.

,dlectro,2012-01-01T09:03Z,"I think this is a nice torrent, a good idea, i don't know why it's so unpopular.
I have seeded more than 130GB and want to continue until it has a better seed-to-peer ratio.

As for my previous comment, i got Alien (8.5GB) and Aliens (17GB) from WiKi's torrent, 'cause it's near Blu-Ray quality and i'm an alien fanatic. :)"
,kimcaine74,2012-02-24T11:36Z,seeeed please:)
,kimcaine74,2012-02-27T00:51Z,seed please:)
,malcolmjb,2012-03-22T20:17Z,I am stuck on 95.6% would someone please seed so I can get the remaining 4.4%. I am going to seed this great torrent only if I can finish downloading it. So Please please seed. Thnx.
,penandpike,2012-04-13T00:07Z,I'll help with the seed for awhile. When trying to reseed I nearly destroyed my own copy of this colection using this new magnet links. I lost 10 % data.
