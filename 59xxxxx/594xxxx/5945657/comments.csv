As with the other films in your Bill Douglas Trilogy, the file name makes no mention of it being a blu-ray rip and it is listed under 'Movies'.  Unless I'm missing something, surely it should be listed under 'Highres-Movies'?  

I'd strongly recommend that you rename the files as blu-ray rips and re-list them as highres movies.  If I had not checked your release information, I would not have known that and would not have downloaded the movie.  

As a proud Scotsman myself, I love to watch the old Scottish movies and I've now downloaded all of the Trilogy from you.  Many thanks sadbawang, your efforts are much appreciated. :-)"
