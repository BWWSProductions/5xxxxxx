REVIEW:

Slime City is a movie about Robert Sabin eating yogurt or something and he starts to go insane as his body melts. So, he he decides to kill people. I saw this at a local mom and pop shop a few years ago, and the line on the front that proclaimed the movie was a \"Jarring gore epic\" really made me interested. It is jarring, it is kinda gory, but it\'s not really epic -- it\'s just really, really good. For those who like films like Body Melt and Basket Case, this is the perfect film for you. Weird gore scenes that don\'t really make any sense, one actress playing two different lead characters, and a script loading with strange events. 

There\'s a gang member fight where one gang member gets his arm stuck inside a guy\'s body, there\'s some hilarious lines (a friends witnesses Robert\'s bodies melting and says, \"And I thought my acne was bad!),
and the finalÃ© is silly but gooey and gory enough to be entertaining. The whole thing is a little directionless in some parts but is extremely compelling throughout and worth a watch for even people that aren\'t into campy gore movies.
