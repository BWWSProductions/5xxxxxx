 Aashayein is the story of Rahul Singh, how he  
 goes from living an insignificant life to      
 really living it. It is the story of Rahul's   
 journey from darkness to the light.            
 Aashayein is an inspiring, bittersweet fable   
 that reminds the viewer that life is short     
 and to make the best of it. Aashayein is       
 just as the title suggests a film which focuses
 on hopes. It teaches us to live life today     
 and not tomorrow. The philosophy of the        
 film, if truly followed, is liberating.
