they are a compressiopn format and you need winrar to extract them search for it it.
you then select all of the files and right click and select extract here then hopefully you should be left whit the game"
,xrayd123,2011-01-02T10:53Z,where shall i put the cracked content?
,xrayd123,2011-01-02T11:03Z,"When i open the game this pop up: The program can't start because steam_api.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.

,HipKat,2011-01-22T01:15Z,"First, you CAN play hacked MP games. I play MW2 and MW4 online. Just do a google search and you'll find the patched files you need.

Second, I'm installing this now and I'll post if and how I got it all to work."

OK, here's the prblem I'm having. Using the cracked .exe, I get an error that I must have Steam running to play, which I don't have on my computer. Running the original .exe wants me to start n safe mode, but nothing happens when I try it."

,Bluwaffle,2011-03-31T02:52Z,"you don't even need to mount the fucking iso people, just extract the damn iso with winrar and run the setup, that easy, then copy over the files from skidrow folder into the specified directory and you're finished. no need to download extra programs and shit and waste money on buying dvds to burn the shit to that you're only going to use few times."
,Tiramungoyum,2011-04-17T07:36Z,"Downloaded. Extracted. Installed. Moved cracks.

,barnbarn122,2011-05-16T03:59Z,My vid card doesnot support...how to i bypass that...i dont care if its choppy!
,whippy6,2011-08-03T06:07Z,"Thanks .. It works..Initially I installed into a different drive/directory with directx and it gave a ton of problems primarily steam related errors (steam_api not found , exit info in steam api .. bl bla ). Tried a lot of things but no luck.
So i uninstalled and reinstalled into the DEFAULT DIRECTORY that comes during setup then copied the Skidrow crack mentioned earlier. That did the trick.. pc config, core 2 duo 1.8Ghz,2 Gb RAm, Nvidia 7300 Gt card, WIndows XP +Sp3. So not even a gaming rig. I play at 1024x768. Laggy but managed to complete the first mission without any problems.(crash , black screen, etc)
For some reason I think its tied into the DEFAULT DIRECTORY that pops up during setup.. Hopefully the updates would solve the lag..BTW a folder PLAYERS is created in the once any mission is completed.. A backup of that before running the update may help "
