Episode Synopsis: The players compete as duos, which are 

arranged by the winner of a dinner temptation, but the pairings 

don't please everyone. Elsewhere, Bob and Jillian address the 

issues that are holding some contestants back. Then, the pairs 

stack sugar cubes for a challenge before a particularly tense 

weigh-in.
