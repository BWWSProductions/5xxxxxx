We are most happy to bring to you Norman Jewison's "Fiddler on the roof"
a movie celebrated not only by Jewish folk, but by all lovers of a great musical
experience.

We got a great conversion using the industry standard DivX Converter (Plus) from
the Divx corporations own website. Its a 1280 X 720 video with 192k audio - enough
for your own theatre experience at home or even at the community hall I would add
as a suggestion for this scope of quality. Its converted from a 6.55GB MKV file source.

This is a movie that looks at the clash f cultures and at the oppression that 
is often vented in bigoted form against those you dont consider your own.
The families in this movie suffer much from what is the diaspora that is inflicted
on their community in what is hard to understand for those who are the victims of
it all.

That all said, there is great music to enjoy, and a fun look at some cultural
mores that have been part of the landscape in Europe for many centuries certainly.

We have included the soundtrack and found a musical score to include too, from
a quick search on the net for you.


I personally often include "Sunsrise Sunset" in the list of songs I sing at
Karaoke bars locally, including a great Hava nagila rendition I perform, in a manner to do you proud and that you would be thrilled with equally, if you
like this cultural experience too!
