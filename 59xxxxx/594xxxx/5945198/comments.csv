[T],moviesbyrizzo,2010-11-10T13:46Z,Make certain your software is opening the correct torrent file from the torrent download page. We have a whole bunch of seeders already at the starting gate with some peers seeing 1mb speeds on their downloads. cheers! Michael Chessman
[T],moviesbyrizzo,2010-11-10T14:14Z,"I beg your pardon, I see there is a problem with the piratebaysite in trying to download - this is the only place in the world to seed a torrent, however you will find the torrent file in a million other places on the net if you want to look for it there while they get their problems fixed here. Right now we have ten seeds, they are showing two - we are getting fed up i have to tell you with this marginalization of our better torrents in favour of those sporting a skull and crossbones image or something or other perhaps - I dunno what the problem is and I just wish we had alternatives for our folks."
[T],moviesbyrizzo,2010-11-10T14:24Z,"I tried to give you a link for it here but I get a ""database error"" when posting it as a comment. These folks have not much sensitivty in their dealings from the sort f language I see used on this board it doesnt surprise me one bit that they have this style all too often. Anyone know of a better place to post?"
