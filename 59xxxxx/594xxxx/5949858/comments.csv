,dragonballz,2010-11-12T06:10Z,"Why does your videos stutter heavily after few minutes? I have tried VLC, smplayer, media playyer classic but to no avail. I use latest k-lite codecs. 

It only works unstuttered in windows media player. Why is that?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-12T09:51Z,@dragonballz: It's explained above. It seems as you doing playback against any recommendation I gave.
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-12T10:02Z,"@dragonballz: Oh, I remembered problems I have. Short and simple: WMP is only player which can use on proper way DirectX and therefore connect to video overlay and audio drivers on most efficient way.

If I USE something - it must be good, right? Unless someone thinks that he knows better.

If you are ""allergic"" to WMP, use DivX. It's a must anyway. Read."
