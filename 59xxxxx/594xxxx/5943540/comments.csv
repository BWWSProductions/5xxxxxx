[V],catflap,2010-11-09T14:33Z,"is anyone having this problem?
i copied the crack in the right place.

after i get through all of the registation of name, password, secret question, uncheck (i have previously purchased...) i get an error during submission (error 10013), this is still only the first step and i can't get any further.

i have windows 7 64bit.

anyone have a tip for me?

thanks."
[V],catflap,2010-11-09T14:46Z,"forget it. i'm a dope.
i was still running peerblocker while trying to register.

now it works great! thanks a lot."

haha

yea i just finished installing it on a windows 7 computer instead of on my xp and it worked fine so i didnt know the cause of your problem.

I'm glad you could figure it out"
,s3nr1,2010-11-09T16:11Z,Thanks downloading. I wonder how this compares with digsby.
[V],catflap,2010-11-09T16:16Z,"the only thing i don't like about it
is that the fonts on the program are very small.

i don't mean the chat windows, i haven't chatted with anyone yet. but i mean the typeface on the program itself is very small and i haven't found a way to increase the size."

detected in file 'C:\Program Files\Trillian\trillian.exe.

This popped up right after install/crack.  Scanned the torrent, and found the same thing  in the cracked exe.

Just a heads up."

What virus scanner did you use.
I'm using AVG 20011. Dit not detect anything."
,Oddobject,2010-12-09T20:58Z,"@DAMskill

I'm using Avira, and my roommate is using Avast.  Scanned the file on both computers with the same result."
[V],alexisthebest,2010-12-10T04:13Z,"It's a crack, so some antiviruses will say it's infected."
,Damien74,2010-12-11T18:48Z,"Peerblocker? Does that even work nowadays?
as alexisthebest said. Its not infected. It just happens with cracks."
,Oddobject,2010-12-11T20:54Z,"I've been using cracked programs for a long time.  Very few things on my comp aren't from this site.  I know cracks will sometimes show false positives.

But (as of now) three different AV programs on three computers?  That somehow makes me doubt it's a false positive."
,JuggaloLash,2010-12-15T04:57Z,Thanks A Milli. This Program Works Fine. My Anti Virus (Avast) Didn't Pick Up Any Viruses Or Anything
,SAS9211,2010-12-27T13:58Z,"working thanks..so how can i remove my trillian account and the other msn,yahoo accounts which i set up using it because i can't find any account removal process on the website or the client..:-S"
,Green-Banana,2011-01-22T02:57Z,"We have to know, is this immune from those awful forced updates that Cerulean Studios likes to pull on people?  It trips things out every time, requiring yet ANOTHER new crack.  "
,Green-Banana,2011-01-26T17:17Z,"Virus.  Not a false positive.  Actual side-effects witnessed.  Probably keylogging, account hijacking.  "
