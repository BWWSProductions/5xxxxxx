,yosoyusuario,2010-11-14T00:01Z,"To Promosdsharma: Nobody is saying there is something wrong with photoshop. You are missing two tips: 1) Not anyone can use photoshop, and 2) Photoshop is a really ""heavy"" program which means many people can't use it in their pc's. This program on the contrary, is very small (almost 3 MIB) and is uploaded for anyone to freely download it and use it. You don't like it? don't donwload it. Muchas gracias Chusca por todos tus buenos aportes "
