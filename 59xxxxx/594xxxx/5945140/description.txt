    In this extreme sexploitation horror shocker, a psychotic priest         
    travels through a seemingly idyllic suburban landscape and uses his      
    collar to secure the trust of a series of beautiful young women          
    before subjecting these poor beauties to increasingly sadistic bouts     
    of sexual assault. Director Bill Zebub has trimmed all of the filler     
    from the standard serial killer movie and replaced it with a near        
    constant barrage of depraved sexual horror.                              
                                                                             
    "Most serial killer films favor soap opera dialogue and                  
    speculation-depictions of the killer doing anything but the vile         
    deeds for which he became famous. This movie shows ONLY the deranged     
    part of the serial killer's story." - Bill Zebub                         
                                                                             
    WARNING: This film contains graphic nudity and sexual assault and in     
    intended only for mature audiences.                                      
                                                                             
    RAPE IS A CIRCLE director Bill Zebub merges horror with sexploitation    
    in this lurid shocker about a depraved priest who lures innocent         
    suburban girls into sexual slavery. Unlike other directors who opt a     
    more restrained approach to the topic of serial killers, Zebub's aims    
    to rile viewers by emphasizing only on the most blasphemous and          
    horrifying aspects of his twisted tale.
