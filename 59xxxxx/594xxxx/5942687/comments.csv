DO NOT update - no need to is there ? 

RUN NERO CLEAN TOOL before instal IF you had previous nero on computer - 

Refuse internet out  then all wil lwork smoothly .

So as above : go to nero and download remove tool.clean tool then run youruninstaller or advanced system cleaner (see my torrents here : http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=62794 ) to CLEAN ALL your computer then start again .

Let us know"
