,Crowly42,2010-11-11T06:15Z,oh and once you have downloaded all 35gb of this please seed for awhile. it takes a long time for me to upload crap this big :-) to bail out after its done is kinda shitty 
,Crowly42,2010-11-11T11:24Z,This torrent is healthy... torrent statistics are kinda screwy at the moment on TPB because the openbittorrent tracker is down.

,EmBoLa.be,2011-02-19T16:14Z,"@ Crwoly, why are you sticking with the old 3.41fw, really ???, there are plenty of easy to use cfw out there, just copy 1 file to  usb start ps3 in recovery mode and install cfw 3.55, i prefer Kmeaw, has the most support for homebrew+ online gaming with cfw 3.55, yeah"
