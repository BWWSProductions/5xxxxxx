Here it is again, a full site rip of http://bstj.bell-labs.com. All files present and accounted for. If you place the folder "BSTJ" in the root of a drive the index file inside the folder will work. 

This rip has been created by members of Hackerspace Brisbane (http://hsbne.org) and The Geek Group (http://www.thegeekgroup.org).
