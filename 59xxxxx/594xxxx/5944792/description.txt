    A woman's haunting visions reveal a Catholic priest's sinister plot      
    to silence her mother from speaking the truth about the atrocities       
    that took place at her Native American boarding school. A                
    contemporary drama of suspense, Older Than America delves into the       
    lasting impact of the cultural genocide and loss of identity that        
    occurred at these institutions across the United States and Canada.
