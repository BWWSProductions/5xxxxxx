,InvisibleLibrary,2010-11-11T17:45Z,"They are ePub & mobi eBooks.  Both Barnes & Noble and Amazon have free software readers you can download for your PC or other device (iPhone, Android, etc) that will open the epub or mobi files.  Or, you can download calibre, which is a free third-party reader/library program that handles many, many formats and can convert between them."
,InvisibleLibrary,2010-11-11T17:50Z,"Just to clarify - the ePub format is for Barnes & Noble, the mobi format is for Amazon.  The content is identical, I included both for convenience.  You don't need both."
