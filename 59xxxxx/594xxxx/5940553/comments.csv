I use The old Internet Explorer 7 and till this afternoon have had no problem uploading my torrents. I upload around 10 a day. About 21 30 hrs uk time i tried several times to upload 4 different torrents to the bay and each time i get a complete white screen with the words ""could not open socket in top left hand corner. I have checked recent torrents and nobody else seems to be having a problem uploading. So i tried to log in to this forum and it would not accept my pirate bay username and password. I tried to reg and it said my email is being used by somone else. Can sombody help me with this coz its driving me mad. Thanks."

[V],sonilem,2010-11-09T04:00Z,"No offence to you my friend but my name is not sonilem. My name is Melvinos. I was a VIP on the bay last year when the 4 who owned it was going through court under my name Melvinos. I had over 1500 uploads and when the change over took place my account was trashed. I have since re registered under a new user name, coz they would not except Melvinos. I attempted to write Melvinos backwards but like an idiot i missed out the v. I have since uploaded over 300 hundred torrents with no probs or viruses. The bay useualy make you a trusted member when you reach around 250 unvirused uploads. (could be wrong as their is no rule about it written in stone so to speak). Thats why i am a trusted member. I guess i am a sad kind of guy as i download and upload around 10 - 14 hours a day. I suffer with a few problems of which one is being afraid of going out so this is all i have. I like to share as my great grandad was ripped of his redundency and life by the great Disney corperation. The only reason i dont upload their stuff is my grandad would turn in his grave if i was promoting their stuff no matter how its done. Sorry if i or this situation has offended you my friend. I would gladly give you my trusted skull if i could as it means nothing to me. I did not ask for it. I was given it."
