,riahc3,2010-11-10T14:39Z,Damn it...........2 CDs............Why?!?!?!? Anyone with a Xvid capable player should have one with DVDs so CDs are a thing of the past.
,robpip79,2010-11-11T01:29Z,yeah but if you put them both on one dvd it goes right into the second one without you even noticing
,nittany,2010-11-12T03:18Z,"Meh, I'll wait for a non-split copy.  Why break it into 2 CD's, do people even burn movies still?

Just get an external hard drive and put all your movies on that and pick up a WD TV Live off ebay for $70 and bam, you can play everything on your TV."
,gustavo8448,2010-11-14T22:04Z,useless comments..... no audio/vid comments... will download and rate... feedback soon!!
,gustavo8448,2010-11-16T03:01Z,"definitely the best version out there even though its split.. but who cares???!?!? 

A:10
V:9 (10 would be if it was bluray/High Def rip)
M:? havent watched yet but looks promising

oh and people complaining its 2 cds/split... get over it... at least u didnt have to pay to watch this movie... and if u care so much into making this one file.. use this tool called GOOGLE and search for a program that put the 2 pieces together.. its out there ive done it before just cant remember the name of it...

anyways THANKS raymondhome  for this awesome post!!!"

However it is a decent copy, Download at you own risk!!!"
,LunarHigh,2011-01-06T04:15Z,"Don't bash me, but I'm here to provide on honest opinion on this torrent. For a so called DVD-Rip the quality is abysmal.....not only is the file split which is just gay, but the picture/resolution is just fuzzy as shit. It looks like a crappy VCR Screener to me. If you haven't watched this movie yet, then the quality is more than watchable if that's what you're worried about; but if you're like me and looking to add this to your movie collection, skip it. Thanks anyway Raymond.

,chewster,2011-01-17T13:32Z,who the hell is still burning files on to cd to watch them? I stopped doing that 8 years ago! buy a media box already!! jesus!!
,greylion,2011-03-21T17:15Z,"A/V: 8/8
Splitting it in two is just silly, nobody burns CD's with half a movie on each anymore.
M: 6, and that's being generous.
Lots of wierd dialogue and gay acting thrown in, in odd spots, which is probably supposed to be funny, but isn't. This was pretty much a waste of time to watch."
