Thanks a ton =)
I know we've all heard this before, but if you download something this big, please seed... Once I get this I will seed as long as possible."
,shatman,2011-02-24T10:42Z,"Dude thanks! But I'm not downloading this, at least not yet. The ratio of seeders to leechers is .25, something this big would take BLOODY AGES to DL. :("
,Imaloser2,2011-03-01T02:23Z,"@Shatman
Yeah, it takes forever to download, but it's worth it. Start the download please, I have 100% and I'll seed until I've seeded 4 times as much as I downloaded (and SEED!!!)"
,Imaloser2,2011-03-01T02:25Z,"Sorry about the double post, but I'll seed it AT LEAST until I've reached 4x. I'll try to seed it longer than that (10x sounds good...)"
