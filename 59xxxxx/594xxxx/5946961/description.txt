        Life's A Beach!

        The sequel to the highly successful Australian comedy The  Wog
        Boy - will again star Nick Giannopoulos and Vince Colosimo  as
        best mates Steve and Frank.

        The Kings Of Mykonos: Wog Boy 2 picks up a few years after the
        original and things  aren't going so  well for the  'Wog Boy';
        he's lost  his true  love (a  '67 Valiant  Pacer) and  all his
        assets because he trusted Tony the Yugoslav. Steve's best mate
        Frank  has  lost  his  touch with  the  ladies  after  a messy
        divorce. But fortune,  as ever, favours  the 'Wog' when  Steve
        discovers that he has inherited  a beach on the resort  island
        of Mykonos from an uncle he never met...
