Plot

More dreams are shattered as Dermot O'Leary announces the results of another public vote, revealing who will be leaving the competition and which acts will make it one step closer to a recording contract with Simon Cowell's label. The judges also welcome Dannii Minogue's sister Kylie to the stage for a performance of her new single Get Outta My Way, and 2005 X Factor winner Shayne Ward returns to perform his latest track.
