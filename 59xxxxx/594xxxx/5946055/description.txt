Imagine Jeff Buckley covering the Nick Drake songbook, or Ron Sexsmith taking on Paul McCartney's first couple of solo albums, and you'll get the idea. The breezy, gorgeous "Air Guitar" is worth the price of admission, sounding like the best song Macca himself never wrote. "Cartoon Heart" and "Emoticons" are almost as good, with Jason's understated arrangements and string quartet backing, but there are also more upbeat tunes like the biting Elliott Smith-styled pop of "Dear Sally" and the musical melodrama of "Romeo and Juliet Are Drowning" to even things out. While Ben's Jeff Buckley-esque croon can overwhelm a couple of the weaker tunes, and the strings-only "What I Meant To Say" is almost TOO precious, this is a great album. These Londoners are pop classicists who are not ashamed of the Carole King and Joni Mitchell records in their collections.
