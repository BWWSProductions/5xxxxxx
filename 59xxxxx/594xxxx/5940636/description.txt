2010 Twice Reflected Sun [Digipak]    CD  Navigator NAVIGATOR41 

Twice Reflected Sun forms a significant departure from previous releases in that instead of presenting a mix of traditional and contemporary writing, songs and tunes drawn from English and Australian sources, it consists entirely of self-penned material. 
Twice Reflected Sun both well encapsulates Nancy and James' appeal and moves their creative endeavours to a higher plane of invention.
