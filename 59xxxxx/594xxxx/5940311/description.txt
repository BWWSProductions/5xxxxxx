Col. William Guile leads an army of soldiers into the country of Shadaloo to find
traces to lead him to General M. Bison, who has captured many people including three
missing soldiers. Among them is Carlos "Charlie" Blanka, in which Bison decides to
turn into a hideous mutant. On the other hand, Chun Li is a reporter who seeks revenge
against Bison for the death of her father years ago. Then two small time hustlers
Ryu and Ken, are arrested along with Sagat, a powerful arms dealer and Vega for
dealing of illegal weapons. Guile recruits them in order to find Bison's base.
Now Guile, T. Hawk, Cammy, Ryu, Ken, Chun Li, Balrog and E. Honda have three
days before Bison murders the hostages and takes over the world.
