                    Queen's Gambit.                          
                    Medical drama series. Jac is in fighting mode  
                    to secure Ric's old job. But whilst trying to  
                    make amends for a row with Chrissie, she fails  
                    to do pre-op checks on a high-risk patient, and  
                    they nearly lose him on the table. With her  
                    chance of promotion in jeopardy, she pins the  
                    blame on Chrissie. Jospeh swallows his concerns  
                    about Faye's mental wellbeing; for fear that  
                    she'll shut him out altogether. When she has a  
                    very public meltdown on the ward, he realises  
                    she's become a risk to herself and their unborn  
                    son. But can he accept the awful truth and get  
                    her formally sectioned? Donna has to bring her  
                    daughter Mia into work and hide her from  
                    Hanssen while getting AAU through a ward  
                    inspection. When Mary-Claire and Elizabeth come  
                    to the rescue she thinks she's survived a  
                    nightmare day, but then Mia springs one last  
                    surprise on her.
