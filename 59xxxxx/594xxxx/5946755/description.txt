Top reasons to buy Acrobat 9 Pro:

â€¢ Unify a wide range of content in a PDF Portfolio

Combine documents, drawings, e-mail, and spreadsheets in a 
single compressed PDF Portfolio. Use professionally designed
 templates that can be branded with your logo and include 
 descriptions to guide recipients through the contents.

â€¢ Help protect your documents
Use passwords to help control access to PDF documents. 
Use permissions to restrict printing, copying, or altering. 
Save passwords and permissions as security policies that 
can be easily applied to new PDF files.

â€¢ Easily create and manage electronic forms
Convert Microsoft Word and Excel documents or scanned paper
 to PDF forms with automatic recognition of fillable fields. 
 Use AdobeÂ® LiveCycleÂ® Designer software â€” a professional 
 form design tool â€” to create, customize, and automate dynamic
  XML forms. Use the Form Tracker to see when forms have been
   completed and who has completed them. Easily export data 
   to a spreadsheet for analysis and reporting.

â€¢ Manage and track electronic document reviews
Gain the input you need through interactive document reviews
 that enable participants to see and build on other reviewers' 
 comments, which can be sorted by author, date, or page. 
 Use the Form Tracker to monitor progress and participation.

â€¢ Include Adobe Reader users
Enable users of free Adobe ReaderÂ® software (version 8 or later)
 to digitally sign documents, participate in shared document
  reviews, and save forms locally. By extending Adobe AcrobatÂ® 
  functionality to Reader users, you can enable virtually 
  anyone to participate in the workflows you initiate.

â€¢ Synchronize document views
Help colleagues, clients, and partners get on the same page 
at the same time with the ability to co-navigate documents. 
To provide clarity and enhance discussion, use Acrobat.com 
services to enable collaboration on a PDF file. Then distribute
 the PDF file and walk recipients through it in real 
 time by controlling the page view they see.

â€¢ Permanently remove sensitive information
Use redaction tools to black out sensitive text, illustrations,
 or other information, permanently deleting the content from
  the PDF document. Inspect PDF documents for metadata, 
  hidden layers, and other concealed information 
  to remove before distributing the files to others.
  
â€¢ Compare PDF documents
Automatically highlight the differences between two 
versions of a PDF document, including text and images, 
so you can quickly and easily identify what has changed.

â€¢ Improve print processes
Help control costs and reduce errors with automated
 output controls to preview, preflight, correct, and 
 prepare PDF files for high-end print production and digital publishing.

â€¢ Create and validate accessible PDF documents
Ensure your PDF documents are optimized for people
 with disabilities. Create accessible PDF documents
  from almost any source to help comply with standards.
   Quickly evaluate, correct, and automatically tag PDF
    documents for optimized accessibility and reflow.
