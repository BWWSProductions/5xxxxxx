thinkingParticlesâ„¢ 4.0 is the next generation rule based particle system for 3ds Max and 3ds Max Design, offering unparalleled power to the user. thinkingParticles in its latest incarnation, Release 4, (R4) redefines Fluid, Rigid Body and Particle F/X simulation in a whole new way.
The advantage thinkingParticles delivers over event-based particle systems, (which works on triggers and time dependent events) made it the #1 choice of Unchartered Territory for creating Fluid, Rigid Body Dynamics and Particle Effects for their movie production of "2012." thinkingParticles was the key production tool responsible for driving the most prominent special effects in the movie "2012". Our latest additions to the software made it so powerful, it actually rendered the need for practical effects to zero!! We trust, that you will find, by using thinkingParticles 4.0, that you will be able to create all the incredible effects that you have always wanted to create, but until now, have not been able to, due to the limitation of existing technologies.

Sam Khorshid a professional Digital Artist, who worked at Uncharted Territory in the making of Roland Emerich's latest movie, "2012" says:
Due to the sheer number of dynamic, interacting systems, we needed a procedural solution. This show was too complex for each artist to work on a shot level. Thinking particles R4 was the right fit for this task. The basis for our destruction pipeline was TP4's integrated dynamics (shape collision) and rule based workflow, coupled with finalRender's fantastic instancing ability. volumeBreaker too, was specifically developed for "2012" along with a new robust joint system, layered caching with retiming functionality and new mesh handling tools for ingesting complex buildings into particle systems. What these new innovations enabled, was the creation of a world that dynamicly interacts with all of its elements: buildings reacting to earth upheavel, cars reacting to falling debris, everything interconnected.

Key Features of thinkingParticles R4

This release of thinkingParticles is not only about adding complete new nodes, it is also about enhancing existing nodes, which offer extended benefits, as completely new nodes are expected to do. Major improvements and upgrades have been done to the proprietary Physics Solver which now takes full advantage of Multiple Core systems. Many new ground breaking concepts have been developed for thinkingParticles R4, like true hierarchical object demolition functions that integrate perfectly with the new Physics Solver engine and that allow the user to create complex demolition sequences, in an easy and fully procedural way.

volumeBreakerâ„¢ Technology has been fully integrated into thinkingParticles R4, allowing for real procedural volume breaking.
