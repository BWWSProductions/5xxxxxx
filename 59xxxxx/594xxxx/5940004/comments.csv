[T],trialNerror,2010-11-09T13:15Z,"As for a fair A/V rating, don't know what any previous viewers would say, but to me it's about an 8/8.  

The right-hand side of the frame was cropped too much, but like the info above reads; this is not mine originally - found it elsewhere and brought it over here - and it's not a remake of the webrip, this is a tvrip.  "
,Nickyboy7,2010-11-11T15:53Z,"Yes it's better than the web rip I put up. Another thing with this guys uploads is they all work on PS3 without having to convert them, which is also a big plus.

Thank you for your work, it was getting very hard to find quality uploads of this show. Very happy you've stepped up to fill the gap."
