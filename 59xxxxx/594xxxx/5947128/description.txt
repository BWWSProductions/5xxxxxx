Good quality scan, no missing pages seems.

From authors: 
@Inside this book are full histories and dispositions of the nine Space Marine Chapters who played the most significant part in the Badab WarÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s early stages. The Astral Claws, Fire Hawks, Marines Errant, Red Scorpions, Raptors, Novamarines, Fire Angels, Howling Griffons and Lamenters are each illustrated with extensive colour profiles.
 
This volume also contains a complete army list, The TyrantÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s Legion, representing those forces that defended HuronÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s conquered realms from the ImperiumÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s wrath, and a purpose-designed campaign system for you to re-fight your own Badab War. Also included are five unique campaign missions and a special Boarding Assault mini-expansion for Warhammer 40,000 that allows you to fight brutal ship-to-ship combats on the tabletop. 

The full-colour, 208-page book contains 15 colour pictures, 120 full colour Space Marine infantry and vehicle profiles and 10 detailed colour star maps, as well as three new Apocalypse formations and twelve new special characters representing mighty warriors from the Space Marine Chapters featured in this book.
