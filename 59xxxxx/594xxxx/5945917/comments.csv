Just wish the episode was a bit smaller (60-100mb), takes me 20 hours to download the 350's."

One quick question though. How come piratebay says there are 0 seeds, while utorrent shows ~7000 seeds and 10000 peers?"

Cable? I still have cable (for like 5 for minutes), and will not, repeat, WILL NOT(!) sit through the commercials anymore.

Not only will they make you dumber for watching, or even subliminally listening to them... but the cable companies have decided to up the decibels of commercials so much so, that when listening to a show at normal volume, as soon as a commercial comes on, cover your ears. Sorta like at the theaters during the previews. They figure, ""assault their senses, and we'll get loads of consumers...""

Today, I am calling Rogers Cable, and telling them to fuck off. Im sick of paying out the ass to have to sit through commercials. And those specialty channels, the ones you pay extra for, like AMC... those douchebags will turn an 1.5 hr movie in to a 3+ hour ad fest. 8 mins of movie, 5 mins of commercials every 13 minutes. 

Oh well, the good thing is we'll be taking the 60 we spent on cable monthly, to up our internet connection. Currently I can upload ONLY at 512kbps, that will change to 2Mbps and I can finally start to give back to this awesome community."
