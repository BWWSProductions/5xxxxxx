Victor Victoria is a most favorite of my movies personally in that I find
it does wonders for the spirit to have Julie Andrews and Robert Preston
repartee as they do in situations that certainly do serve as inspiration
to loftier attempts to articulate with clever wit, and with intelligence
that is as I say, in great sprit!

The "dinner at the Ritz on an empty wallet scene" is unforgettable and 
a "tour de force" around the Hollywood sets when you consider their 
more recent exploits at the box office, by comparison. Ms. Andrews deserves
not only a dinner on the house, but the best dinner we can muster, even
if we have to blame the cockroaches for having to forgive her bill.

We will soon have an HD DivX widescreen 2GB version for all to share

we ask for your seeding support for Franch language constituents!! 

with thanks!
