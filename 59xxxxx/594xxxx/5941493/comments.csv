Delocated is also showing zero seeders.


You guys post faster than eztv, but at least eztv has seeders.

I often start a download with you guys, reach a ratio of 14.000 and download about 25 to 30% by the time eztv posts the same show, and then download eztv's in 6 or 7 minutes."
,PhilLesh12,2010-11-08T08:38Z,"...and I'm only saying this because you guys were and should be better!

You guys used to kick eztv's ass.  Not that it's about that, but you know what I mean, you guys were quick to up, and had fast downloads.

Now you are quick to up, but your downloads are frustratingly slow.

I've got 25/25 FiOS on the east coast.  Is there some way I  can help?"
