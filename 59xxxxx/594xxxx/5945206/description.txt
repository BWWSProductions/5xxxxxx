Release notes:

Kid Rock will release his 8th studio album, 'Born Free,' on November 15th via
Atlantic Records. The record was produced by Rick Rubin and mixed by Greg
Fidelman. The first single from the album will be, appropriately, 'Born Free'
which hits radio September 14th. 'Born Free' is in many ways a transformational
album for Kid Rock. While there is still the edge, wit, and swagger of previous
albums, he doesn't rap, there's no metal - there isn't even a parental warning
sticker.

Says Kid Rock, 'The catalyst for this record was Detroit, and my thoughts on the
world through the lens of Detroit. Watching everything go downhill over the past
few years, the economy, the loss of jobs everywhere, I wanted to make a record
that reflected the times but that still had soul.'

The bulk of the album was recorded live in a two week span in Los Angeles with a
stellar cast of musicians including Heartbreaker Benmont Tench, Red Hot Chili
Pepper Chad Smith, David Hidalgo from Los Lobos and Chavez guitarist Matt
Sweeney. Studios in Detroit, Nashville and Atlanta were used to incorporate
collaborations with Bob Seger, Sheryl Crow, Zac Brown, Trace Adkins, and in a
pairing surely never to be replicated - T.I. and Martina McBride on the track
'Care.' Kid Rock and Rick Rubin, as friends, have spent many hours talking about
their respective histories - starting in hip-hop, crossing into and creating new
territories - as well as the need for a great new American classic rock record
that challenges the field. 'Born Free' is in part the result of those
conversations - an album that is meant to be played from start to finish.

Enjoy!
