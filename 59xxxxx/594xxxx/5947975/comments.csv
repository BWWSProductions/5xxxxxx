Can some of you folks that have seeded, increase your upload rate for 10 or 12 hours?  I genuinely would appreciate it.  Thanks!"

,SLIKFUK,2010-11-22T15:30Z,Can't somebody seed this game?  Eight days later and I'm still at only 30%.  It would be nice if somebody could afford at least 10 kB/s.  Maybe I'm asking too much.
,SLIKFUK,2010-11-29T09:33Z,I'm stuck at 47.8% and its day 16.  How about a little help guys.  I'm an American stationed in Afghanistan and I would like to watch the game.  Any help (extra bandwidth for downloading) will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!
