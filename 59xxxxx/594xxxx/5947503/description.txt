                    Losing My Religion.                      
                    Contemporary drama series. When Joanne's son  
                    Jamie gets bullied, she assumes that his  
                    Catholic school will do everything they can to  
                    help. She is shocked to discover, though, that  
                    he is being attacked because the other children  
                    think he's gay. Headteacher Mr Georgeson runs a  
                    tight ship, but although he says he abhors  
                    bullying, he can't condone homosexuality.  
                    Joanne's husband Dave tells her to keep her  
                    nose out, as she'll make it worse, and that  
                    Jamie'll grow out of it. But things are much  
                    worse for Jamie than anyone realises, and if  
                    the school and his parents don't support him,  
                    will Jamie be pushed to desperate measures?
