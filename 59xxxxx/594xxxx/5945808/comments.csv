,prius4845,2011-03-11T00:39Z,"@mikekolesar sorry I couldn't get back to you quickly, but first of all if you have double sided dvd's or dual layer dvd's you can just burn the files with any burning software (i like Nero the best)and just watch it. or if you just have standard dvd's you would split the three discs into six by using any spitting software(i think the best is dvd Fab). if you have trouble with this or you don't have dvd's you can just take the files and convert it to .ISO format so you can watch on your computer(to do this the best is power iso(you can use it to mount the iso files too.))(it is also faster to just watch it on your computer) if you have any more specific questions just ask. And of course all of the programs i have listed above are completely free on thepiratebay.org if you are new to the site! cheers!"
