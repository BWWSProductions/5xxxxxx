,Vasheal,2010-11-10T17:59Z,awesome! another quick upload. thanks a lot man!
,kooper35,2010-11-10T18:41Z,"Uploaded ""17:48"" somebody downloaded and commented ""17:59""? dude please..."
,kooper35,2010-11-10T18:47Z,comment deleted?
,Senshi112,2010-11-10T22:58Z,I unzipped and moved all content to appdata\roaming\.minecraft (running Win7) and it still says I need to play online before playing offline? Any ideas whats wrong?
,kutu111,2010-11-10T23:01Z,Am i able to use online? asap
,epwnzor,2010-11-10T23:23Z,"@senshi: try deleteing all the old stuff in the .minecraft folder (except your saves folder) and then replacing everything. that seemed to work for me. 

A name changer thing like in the other releases would be useful.."
,epwnzor,2010-11-10T23:33Z,"just kidding, the old minecraft_name.jar works fine with it."
,narfdude,2010-11-11T00:18Z,"@Senshi112  I tested this without anything else in the .minecraft folder. move everything to a backup folder and try it with just the bin and resources folders and minecraft.jar.

@kutu111 yeah it plays online with a name changing launcher as long as the server isnt set to verify names. i didnt include one with this though. to get one just download an older minecraft torrent and take it from there.

@epwnzor  if notch updates the minecraft launcher then we will need a new name changer."
,Senshi112,2010-11-11T02:42Z,Got it working. Thanks for the upload!
,Digital55,2010-11-11T03:01Z,"Thanks narfdude, really appreciate you uploading this so fast. Awesome sauce."
,Lowhunter,2010-11-11T14:31Z,"Very nice and fast! Great job.
Singleplayer working as it should, but the only problem is multiplayer. I did have NanoEntity's 1.1.3 before with a namespoofer, but after the 1.2.1 update, I couldnt connect to my own server as it did before. It only says: ""Connection refused: Connect"" Port is forwarded and open, so I don't know what is wrong. Any advice is appreciated ^^ "
,Lowhunter,2010-11-11T14:38Z,"Ah problem solved, my server didn't have the original port (25565) but it had 25566 as port so I had to type my ip-address+port to connect. "
,eXoflow,2010-11-11T20:14Z,thx keep em coming :)
,Polpo-,2010-11-14T12:12Z,Thanks ! It works wonderfully !
,MajinCry,2010-11-16T17:54Z,"Eh...Multiplayer just gives me a timeout.

""Failed to connect to server

Connection timed out""

Bleh."
,TrexiZ,2010-11-17T05:12Z,"Thanks dude! Worked great, just follow the instructions then start minecraft.jar"
,ddrag,2010-11-17T05:52Z,"Many thanks, man!

You're the guy."

Theres a Direct upload incase anyone needs it."
,hungryman521,2010-11-20T01:10Z,"i cant find appdata where is it, i found AppData, but it didnt have a roaming folder in it so i was not sure,so i just created a file called roaming but it wont let me create a file called .minecraft only minecraft, and that just tells me i need to play once online to play offline."
,BigCrunchy,2010-11-20T05:21Z,"Nice quick download. But where is this appdata crap where i have to save this to. can someone please tell me how to do it, thanks"
,2316816,2010-11-20T22:40Z,"I keep getting ""User is not Premium"" or, on occasion, ""Launcher is Outdated"".
I have yet to been able to play online, any help?"
,narfdude,2010-11-20T23:37Z,"an easy way to put the files where they need to go is to: right click minecraft.rar and click ""extract files..."" under 7zip or winrar in the context menu. 
then for the destination type: %appdata%\.minecraft. 
to get to the files you just extracted, paste %appdata%\.minecraft into your address bar in an explorer window."
,do0m86,2010-11-22T00:40Z,"This might seem like a noob question, but what do I double-click to play Minecraft?  I put all the files in .minecraft in appdata roaming (to those who don't know how to do it for vista, you have to go to control panel> folder options> view> show hidden folders--the folder will be located under ""administrator"" or ""user"") but I don't know what to double-click to start the game.  There's a minecraft.jar file and it just opens up files to extract."
,narfdude,2010-11-24T03:32Z,"@do0m86 it sounds like you dont have java installed. install java and try double-clicking it again.
if you know it is installed then it might mean windows is using something else to open the .jar instead. if this is the problem, right-click minecraft.jar, go to ""open with"" and click java. let me know if that doesnt fix it."
,OWNTthunder,2010-11-25T08:45Z,ok i did everything i was told to now im in the .minecraft folder how to i get the game to come up what do i click on?

,jmadams85,2010-11-26T23:08Z,"i did nothing wrong.  I put it in the appdata/roaming/.minecraft folder just like you said.  i tried it both zipped and unzipped.
still saying i need to play online.
so whats going on?"
,jmadams85,2010-11-26T23:13Z,"nvm I got it.  I just did what narfdude suggested and it worked.
thanks man"
,blackwolf23,2010-11-27T20:49Z,"it tells me not premium play online first to play ofline 
pls help"
,narfdude,2010-11-28T01:22Z,"@blackwolf23 the files arent in the right places. you are going to have to learn how to show hidden folders first. then you will have to get to your appdata (application data in windows xp) folder which is in your ""username"" folder. if you have xp just put all the files in a folder named .minecraft in there. if you have vista or 7, go into the ""roaming"" folder first then do the same.

use minecraft.jar inside of .minecraft to start it when you are done."
,Decreased,2010-11-28T11:51Z,"To me this shows up to be ver. 1.1.2, not 1.2.2...

,AlleOpsO,2010-12-18T23:16Z,"Those that dont know how to make the program open, or sees it like a rar file, first make sure you have java installed
when its installed do this
right click on minecraft (rar file, or what file it now is, the file that is inside the .minecraft folder) press open with and then browse, and open with javaw.exe or just javaw"

Write 'C:Users#USER#AppDataRoaming.minecraft' and change 'C' to your driver letter and '#USER#' to a youser on your computer. This way a map '.minecraft' will be created."
