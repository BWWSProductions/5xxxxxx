Well, here it is.

I used winrar this time.

Put this stuff in appdata\roaming\.minecraft for vista and 7. Put it in application data\.minecraft under xp.

I don't have a mac but I'm pretty sure you put this in library/application support/minecraft

If you get an error that says you must play online to enable offline then you did it wrong.
