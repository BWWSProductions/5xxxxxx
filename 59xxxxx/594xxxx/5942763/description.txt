\"Laila\'s Birthday\" portrays a day in the life of a Palestine taxi driver, \"Abu Laila\". The twist here is that Laila previously served as a judge under Arafat but has been unable to get reinstated due to the multiple changes in government. His day starts simply enough with a request from his wife to be home by 8pm to celebrate their daughter Laila\'s birthday. And, he does indeed make it home on time. But his journey presents numerous hurdles that nearly derail his objective. Those obstacles include a car bombing, the kidnapping of his taxi, and an unusual assortment of passengers who test his patience.
