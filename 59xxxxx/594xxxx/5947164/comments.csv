,ohflip,2010-11-11T06:32Z,"mindgrind 

install game

use keygen in crack folder to generate a key (the top line)do not exit the keygen..leave it on the desk top for now

then enter that key in game when it asks..you then have a choice of activating over the internet or phone,,,,choose phone......it will then give you a number which you write down (and tells you to phone them and tell them that number, but you dont phone them)
put that number in the key gen where your original code is ..i think its the second line down you put your new number and click generate again and it will give you your validation number to enter ...just enter that validation number in the game and off you go

all done"
,MrMustachio,2010-11-11T07:01Z,"I also can't continue after finishing the prologue. The game wants a new serial, but there's no option to get it via phone. I've blocked the game exe in windows firewall but I guess it didn't work... oh well, seems like a fun game."
,Poganin,2010-11-11T11:44Z,I also got asked for the key after the prologue. Methinks this game requires a crack after all.
,hedwerk,2010-11-11T15:43Z,"Ok Ive actually managed to get it working past chapter 1!! Hereâ€˜s the deal.
Uninstall the game deleting all your save profiles and settings. (you can back these up and paste them in after if you wish)
Install the game as usual.
Block in firewall access to two worlds two.
Run the game and select DEMO - DO NOT ENTER A SERIAL FROM THE KEYGEN YET!
Play the game as usual until it asks for a serial.
ALT TAB out and open the keygen and get a serial
Tab back into the game and enter it.
Choose Phone activation
it will give you a code. Enter that code in the keygen to gain an activation code.
Enter that activation code and voila!

if you wish to use your old saves then paste them back in.

have fun!

have fun ppl :) shame the nfo didnt state the correct instructions."
,mindgrind,2010-11-11T19:07Z,"wow hedwerk, thanks alot man. i hope that works for me as well because it JUST reverted to demo mode on me too. thanks again."
,nymac11,2010-11-11T19:42Z,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME DOWNLOADING THIS THE KEYGEN GENERATES A KEY FOR CHAPTER ZERO WHEN YOU BEAT THIS CHAPTER AND ARE ASKED TO TO TO FIRST CHAPTER IT ASKS YOU FOR A NEW KEY THE OLD ONE DOESNT WORK ANYMORE!!!!!!!!!

,Cederoo,2010-11-11T21:24Z,"Thanks, Hedwerk.

It works past the demo content after I followed your instructions. Too bad I did lost my first save, but that is because I forgot to back it up :)

Thanks again."

,cryfreedom66,2010-11-12T00:00Z,.
,chowp,2010-11-12T00:26Z,cryfreedom66: Your antivirus is probably blocking the file from executing. Either disable your antivirus or add the keygen to the exception rules. BTW if you get an alert from your antivirus it is a false positive. The keygen works.
,DevlinXIII,2010-11-12T00:42Z,"Thx for the upload but I can't seem to get past the ""DEMO"".
here's what I did :
1st - I followed the instructions here, blocked the executable with windows firewall,started the game, used the keygen, bla bla, didn't work...
2nd - I followed Hedwerk's directions, uninstall, delete everything, settings, save, etc...I installed again, played and reached the part where i was asked the serial, so I alt tabbed out and opened the keygen, copy the serial, alt tabbed again to the game, type the serial, but it said ""you cannot move to chapter 1 bla bla"".
I guess I'm one of those with bad luck and will need to wait for a decent crack T_T bye bye Two Worlds II"
,chowp,2010-11-12T00:50Z,Make sure to include the dashes in the activation code peeps. The keygen works.
,crissys,2010-11-12T07:57Z,"i confirm... the game works great if you folow ""hedwerk"" instructions, THANKS ALOT MAN! xD"

,LJ505,2010-11-14T13:57Z,"i just finished the game....the only thing that was annoying is that you after each chapter had to put  new cd key into it....the first two island were great but the last one sucked tottaly, you have only the main quest and one or two side quest but it was anyway a good game... :D"

u can just click the crack folder as a file exception and the keygen will work"

I'd advise you to do this from now on before flaming on a download."

To fix it - Go to Nvidia control panel. Disable all anti-analiasing settings or set it Application Controlled (IN MANAGE 3D SETTINGS) for Twoworlds2.exe in the programs settings  and it'll get to normal. THIS will work. If you are having any other graphics problems, there are patches that fix many of them, EXCEPT for this one. enjoy the game! bad publisher for not teliing how to fix this! "
,ArtOfBeingAwsome,2011-03-13T19:38Z,"Okay, everythings fine so far. Amazing fast download (im gonna seed it for a while) and Game works perfect.

Now i finished the Chapter II and ofc it asks me for a new serial. The old doesnt works anymore as ofc but thats what i expected. So i saved some more keys when i startet the game first by using the KeyGen. But they all doesnt work aswell.

Okay so i uninstalled the game, deleted all Userdatas while having a Savegame Backup ofc. Installed it as usual and started the game in Demo mode. I played as usual until it asked for Serial to pass the Demo Mode. Usually i would use the KeyGen now but it doesnt gives me the choice for phone activation anymore oO. Even on main screen if i click on the Option to activate the game it just shows me the Button to buy it. If i click there the game closes, leading me to the Zuzzex website. Theres no option activate by phone.

Im a bit lost guys, anyone has an idea?"
,ArtOfBeingAwsome,2011-03-13T19:48Z,"Kk problem solved :)

Btw...sometimes it doesnt work if u enter the serials while using Shift. I recommend to enter all Codes without using Shift for the letters. :)"

,l3fg8snj,2011-08-23T21:51Z,"For those having trobule with serial resetting/going invalid after chapter 1 or after a few minutes of play:

You must learn to BLOCK the program in the firewall. I tried just unchecking the program in the list of firewall programs, and that did NOT work.

Here is how you manually block a file in Windows 7:

1. Go to control panel (full view).
2. Click on Windows Firewall.
3. Click on Advanced Settings.
4. Click on Outbound Rules.
5. Click on New Rule to the right.
6. Select Program and click next.
7. Browse for the exe (in this case TwoWorlds2.exe in the install folder) and click open.
8. Click next, and make sure ""Block the connection"" is chosen. Click Next twice, and enter a name (e.g. Two Worlds). Finish.

9. If you want to be extra sure repeat steps 5-8 in the Inbound Rules tab as well.

10. Play. If you last quit the game after being prompted to put in a new serial and do the phone activation, you will probably have to do it one last time, but after that it will stick."

- Create a directory “Two world 2” on your hard disk
- Copy the entire content of a game in Explorer / Win Commander /
- After copying, you’ll see a two file “autorun.exe” and “AUTORUN.INF”, delete it
- Now, run a setup SETUP.EXE. after installing a game restart your computer and then play the game."
