Release Notes - You may or may not get some sound repeating errors its not from a 
                bad rip its the game itself. This has been reported with this game
                even the original will do it. But it might not happen so don't 
                worry.



You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.

If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first
remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

And here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. 

Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

Then you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the
trick.


Game Description:

In the future, on the planet Hillys, the population suffers from constant attacks from the alien DomZ. The situation is gradually getting worse, as the rate of DomZ kidnapings increase. The Alpha Section forces, who are in charge of protecting citizens, seem to be completely ineffective, not even fighting the DomZ. In the midst of this situation, the secretive organization IRIS alleges that the Alpha Section is involved in a massive government conspiracy, and seeks to expose the truth through journalism.

You control the young reporter/photographer Jade, with her companions Pey'j and Double H. After experiencing first-hand a DomZ attack, she is contacted by IRIS, who recruit her as an action reporter. Jade is now tasked with infiltrating the Alpha Section, exposing the government conspiracy, and ultimately finding the truth for herself.

Beyond Good & Evil is an action-adventure game with diverse game play. Most of the game is based on stealth and puzzles, but there are sequences of racing, shooting, combat, and platform action. There are several mini-games and even an online ranking system (used by entering codes online after they are assigned in-game when the game is saved). As the game progresses, a large story unfolds, even dealing with some social issues on the way.


Features:

* Immerse yourself in the living, thriving futuristic world of Hyllis; a planet
  under alien attack for the past 100 years.

* Take control of Jade, a rebel action-reporter, with the fate of the world in her 
  hands.

* Delve into a deep story of deception - gather evidence, expose twisted 
  propaganda and incover the conspiracy.
