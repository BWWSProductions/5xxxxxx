[V],twentyforty,2010-11-11T16:12Z,@alibou91: BN would be upped every week and Room in Rome I cannot encode. Sorry.
,muthineni,2010-11-11T17:07Z,can u rip armageddon in 720p if possible..
,alibou91,2010-11-11T17:50Z,thanks 20-40 will be waiting 4 BN :)
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-11T19:05Z,@muthineni: Armageddon is 150 minutes long (153 Dir.Cut) and as 720p must be minimum 1.34 GB to achieve wanted (my own) standards. Therefore - I cannot do 720p. Sorry.
,milayaa,2010-11-11T20:27Z,oh good one.... the sea horse in the beach shot...awesome! thanks once again!
,ks85,2010-11-12T00:05Z,Thank you :)
,DMVIN,2010-11-12T02:33Z,Thanks for planning to do burn notice.
,muthineni,2010-11-12T03:46Z,"thank you sir for the fast reply. 
And i think ur latest pack had 480p family guy instead of 272 p one. there was a leap in the quality.the size was just 10 mb more.
i hope u get ur hands on more 480p sources n up them each time. keep up the good work"
,believenu,2010-11-12T05:16Z,I usually don't request but thank for your quality and timing while seeding as long as I can. Have you seen or tried the tv show called the defenders? Is it worth your time it seems not bad compared to some of the shows that are out there.I just finished watching lord of the rings . my humble thanks for all that you do and the quality and taste that you do it.always remember everyone seeding is sharing.
,madtown4,2010-11-12T05:58Z,"hi my friend , hope all is well. i was just wondering if you were going to do The Sorcerers Apprentice bluray.MY wife and i just love all your uploads.thank you for what you do......."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-12T08:39Z,"@muthineni: Yeah, I KNOW what 480p brings - I ""invented"" it... Therefore, for two weeks now, once a day, I add following to my long Header:
""NEW RULE: Show that gets ""-"" (negative) rating is on the way out. 
          Let me be clear: 480p is BETTER than XviD - but LESS than half in size. 
          480p has BIGGER frame-size (""picture"" size) than 272p MORE THAN TWICE 
          (2.16 times) - but file-size is bigger just by silly 10% (15 MB approx.).
          Also, 480p has by ONE THIRD BIGGER frame-size than XviD.
          So - new rule: any complaints came from your head only.
          IF you are frustrated with your life or mentally incapacitated - 
          vent someplace else out. My files are perfect - in given category.
          IF you do not think so - here's the deal: Turn around and go away. Forever.
          SUB-RULE: Normal people! Do not let be overrunned by idiots! Not again-
          Do not allow to be over-voiced. Again.
          IF you like my encodings, you CAN say so - by Rating and by Thanking.""

But - I have other things to worry about, like my limited capacity regarding space on server and low upload speed from home. I must do some ""trade-ofs"". 

Beside that, some shows would retain frame format for reasons of requests or continuity too.

@believenu: Don't get me wrong - but some shows I cannot do. I can't stand the guy in that show, not the Belushi guy, but other one. Sorry.

@madtown4: Sure my friend. But, I probably cannot have free slot till late Saturday (AU Sunday). Be here."
