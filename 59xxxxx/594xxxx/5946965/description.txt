This is day two of ESPN3's complete broadcast of the final table of the 2010 World Series of Poker Main Event.  In this broadcast, the final two players in the tournament play heads up to determind the 2010 WSOP Champion.  This is ripped at the optimum bitrate of 1200kbps and is in FLV format because that is ESPN3's native video format.  There are no holecards because it was a live broadcast.  Enjoy!
