Thanks anyways."

english subs are the ones for deaf people (which is really annoying to see on your screen) but you can get the normal ones here :

,BikerzUsa,2010-11-30T20:35Z,Downloaded twice and this BR Rip sucks. it skips all through the movie. Don't download this.
,.Leto.,2011-01-03T01:02Z,"I only saw the previous now, I didn't have that skipping problem when I watched this release. It's your computer dude, not this rip..."
,.Leto.,2011-01-03T01:02Z,*I only saw the previous comment now
,Saki33,2011-01-25T18:33Z,"Thanks.

For those who don't care for HI subs, get a program that removes the deaf text. I use Subtitle Edit 3.0 (free). Drag the sub in, then Tools>Remove text for HI, OK, ctrl-S, and you're done. "
,Saki33,2011-01-25T21:58Z,"Or you could just get these subs:

,midnightjester,2011-02-24T04:59Z,"Looked and sounded good,  but everything was totally off track. Don't know if anyone else had a sync issue with this, but I definitely did and I know it isn't my computer. Good luck!"
,.Leto.,2012-06-17T17:02Z,"Actually I prefered this one:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6837579/The_Kids_Are_All_Right_2010_720p_dts_TESA_multisub_%5Bmkvonly%5D_
about the same size but picture looks more natural. Excessive smoothing with the HDLITE rip. It's like they're all wearing masks, you can't even see the wrinkles of their faces."
