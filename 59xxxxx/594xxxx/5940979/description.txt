                    Rafael Marquez V Juan Manuel Lopez                     
                                                                           
   This is a fight no boxing fan will want to miss.                        
                                                                           
   Future "Hall of Famer", and Two Time World champ, Rafael Marquez is a   
   brutal and devastating warrior. He puts his reputation on the line      
   against the powerful and undefeated, Juan Manuel Lopez.                 
                                                                           
   One of boxing's fastest rising stars, Lopez will attempt to make the    
   third defense of his World crown. The 27-year-old champion has          
   registered an astounding 26 knockouts in 29 professional fights.        
                                                                           
   But in Marquez he faces the toughest and most important test of his     
   career.                                                                 
                                                                           
   A former IBF bantamweight champion, Marquez cemented himself in boxing  
   lore when he moved up to Super Bantamweight to take on Israel Vazquez in
   what became an unforgettable four-fight series that saw each warrior win
   a pair of battles.                                                      
                                                                           
   The 35-year-old is coming off a third-round knockout of his nemesis     
   Vazquez in the final instalment . Now, he'll take on the younger Lopez  
   in a quest for a world title in his third division.
