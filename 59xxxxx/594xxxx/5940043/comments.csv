,Tapndatass,2010-11-08T07:23Z,Hey mod i have a question. Does it take like alot longer to upload movies in 1080p blueray or just 1080p. Because no one has ripped a 1080 Inception. Only dvdrip. Any help?
[M],Ubehage,2010-11-08T08:31Z,Yes. A blu-ray disc will take approx. 3-5 times longer than a normal dvd.

So, It may not burn to dual layer disks. 
But, Its great quality, an a great movie too. 
Thanks for the upload Mod."
