When leechers be greater than seeds,
are slow download speeds.
In time more seeds will come,
and you'll get your episode of gLee!"

,gambino90,2010-11-10T14:10Z,"great video. I watched it the night before you sent it in. oh, by the way, I need people to do something for me. I just made a facebook application and I urge people to come play the game with me and hundreds of members. 

The game is called Mayor of a state, and it is published.

Thanks."
