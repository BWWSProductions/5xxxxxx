Either mount it, or just extract the ISO to a folder, then install from the extracted folder to whatever programfiles/folder you want. After its installed, copy over the crack, make sure you back up the originals for later, incase you want to update.

Multiplayer doesn't work? Then I would need an explanation for why there is a ""BlackOpsMP.exe"" file in the Skidrow folder?

For zombies, I only used SP. Offcourse. It just worked :P. First I finished SP completely, untill the final mission

***SPOILER ALERT***
Then when you are kenedy, I did 1 round to test.
After that, just go to main, and click zombies :P"

,P0pe0nD0pe,2011-09-17T13:22Z,"Okay, guys, to those who are having problems with dlls; Go Google them. Google the error and download from any site that looks legitimate. 

To those who want to play zombies but can't; Download the patch by visiting the ""Call.of.Duty.Black.Ops.Update.1.Read.Nfo-SKIDROW"" folder. It's in the ""bo"" folder that you downloaded, run the patch, let it finish, the go into the ""SKIDROW"" folder, and copy and paste the files to where you installed your game when you ran the FIRST installer. 

To those who want to play MP, go but it, or find a magical torrent. There won't be any. Play with your friends via LAN or Hamachi or some shit. You figure it out. If you have any more questions, PM me."
