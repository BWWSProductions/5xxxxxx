Its some kind of make pretend english."
,ambiotic,2011-04-06T19:34Z,"1.  Thank you for uploading this.  You've done more than me to get this movie to us.

2. For those who speak only English, the translation is very poor (I even looked up some of the words in the subtitles and they don't even exist).  I think the French dialogue was first translated into language other than English, then the same again, then English."
