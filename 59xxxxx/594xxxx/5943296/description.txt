                    Conclusion of the drama based on the novel by  
                    Philippa Gregory. Ruth regains her confidence  
                    at the clinic and returns home - to the barely  
                    disguised resentment of her mother-in-law  
                    Elizabeth. As Ruth finally bonds with her baby  
                    son Thomas, she begs to return to the Little  
                    House but the family insist she is not ready.  
                    Later, Ruth is accused of putting Thomas in  
                    danger, and Elizabeth uses the incident to  
                    reassert her authority. But Ruth retaliates and  
                    seduces Patrick, getting him to agree to relax  
                    the level of control. As Ruth's confidence  
                    grows Elizabeth's grip starts to slip and their  
                    conflict results in a fateful confrontation.
