This CD is by far my favorite Chick Corea recording. When I first heard this in 1978 I immediatly fell in love with it. I have worn out several albums over the last 20+ years and couldn't wait until it was available on CD. The interplay between Chick and this band is flawless. They mix very well together and it's a shame they didn't do a follow up recording together. My favorites are The One Step and Friends. If you buy only 1 Chick Corea in your life this one should be it. ~ "peguesdl"

Between his 1970's Return to Forever albums and his late  80's Elektric band albums, Chick released a number of good small  ensemble jazz albums full of original compositions    albums which have, for whatever reason, languished in obscurity. Here he teams up with Joe Farrell on flute and reeds, Eddie Gomez on bass and Steve Gadd on drums: how can you miss with that kind of line  up? 
Each member of this quartet really contributes to the whole: Eddie Gomez's sound on the bass is rich and full, and Steve Gadd supplies a constant creative energy. The tracks have a great balance between composed structure(including intricate passages with Chick and Joe in unison) and improvisation that lets the individual players shine. Only the slightly hokey sound and lack of energy of the first track, and maybe the Smurfs on the cover, keep this from being five stars. For ten bucks, it's a steal for any Chick fan. ~ Thomas Hastings
