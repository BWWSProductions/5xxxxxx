,halfoff,2010-11-11T00:36Z,"Small question, are the updates cumulative or not? 
ie Does update 3 take care of previous updates, or should I get the original ISO, and the 3 updates?"
,Klimt_Westwood,2010-11-11T00:41Z,This update should have all previous updated content.
,skreemer,2010-11-11T01:03Z,"afaik, update 2 included update 1. so my suggestion is download update 3 and check the "".nfo"" file.
but if you donÂ´t wanna wait, install update 2 and start playing, because it seems itÂ´ll take some time till we get enough seeders here."
,SubGum,2010-11-11T01:28Z,The installer tells you to install the previous updates before this one.
,carterd.net,2010-11-11T01:59Z,"wrong, this doesn't require updates 1 or 2. It includes everything you need. You only need this update!"
,Dark-Por,2010-11-11T02:46Z,"i read was another patch imediatly following the last one (Dunno time frame exactly from the first patch just released to the patch that fixed the first patch)
apperntly made some mobs invincible or something

anyway stuck at 10% so they repacking a new patch or what BTW

I LOVE YOU GUYS SKIDROW and RAZOR1911

keep up the good/great work :)"
,SubGum,2010-11-11T05:43Z,"My mistake.  The setup says:

-------------
[ ] This update require previous updates installed to function properly

[x] This update don't require previous updates installed to function properly
-------------

Could have just said ""This update doesn't require previous updates installed to function properly""
I read the first line and moved ahead since I'd already installed the last updates anyways.

Anyways, forget what I said earlier.  Enjoy."

,diosisback,2010-11-11T10:38Z,"232323: You are not the only one, it happens to me too. The problem lies in the cracked exes: you need to copy and overwrite them with the ones from update 2.

Bad crack from SKIDROW :("
,Separaattori,2010-11-11T11:23Z,"haha, idiots! you should check google sometimes. this update screws archivevalidation. so you need to edit ini files to make it work.

""Quote
To summarize the fixes though, in no particular order (and I have tested both) -
1) Rename your the fake BSA to - ""Fallout - ArchiveInvalidation.bsa"". Update the ini files to reflect this change. This will allow the fake .bsa to be the first on the SArchiveList entry.
2) Change the order of the .bsa files in the SArchiveList. I put ""Fallout - Voices1.bsa"" as the first entry, then the fake .bsa, then the rest of the line.""


...I can confirm the first tactic is working, with NVSE enabled, and I recommend using that incase the next patch messes up archiveinvalidation again, so you only have to rename it. "

It worked 100% for me after installing it. It actually fixed the game from stuttering and everything so that its actually playable! It pretty much runs smooth as fallout 3 now which is quite amazing"

For the record, I didn't need to do anything extra to get the game to work afterwards besides copying over the exe files. So people should just try it first before messing around with the bsa's, may not be necessary for you. "

,OmniNegro,2010-11-12T02:18Z,"If you have a decent modern system and you have terrible FPS then something is very wrong. Shut down all the background crap that is running. Especially the retarded and useless antiviral garbage. If you are not running risky software and you have already scanned the stuff you intend to run, what difference will the antiviral garbage manage besides making your system behave like it is several years older? The answer is nothing at all.

Shut the fuck up if you are unable to figure out how to not only disable, but also UNLOAD that crap. Go to school and learn, or just be patient. Even a retard will learn with time.

How much did the game and this update cost you? You were given a nice new game on a silver platter.

Awwwww. Is your silver platter not polished enough for your tastes? Too fucking bad. You paid nothing. You pay with respect and by learning to pull your head out of your arse. 

Google will tell you anything if you ask it right. If you need help, find a nice forum to troll like a bitch.

Damn. I am going a bit far here. Most here understand my prospective though. And those who do not have my sympathies, but they will learn and in time will probably agree 100%. If not, then I am really interested in learning what to call the sub-animal retard."
,yuwuxie,2010-11-12T06:16Z,"Wow, this update really helps the graphics, the game runs much smoother now.

I read that I should use my cracked exe from the Update.2...I noticed that when I go into my options the game says I am running version 1.1.1.271 (which is the old Update.2).

,deepandhard,2010-11-12T21:24Z,"fwiw, i got the same update off usenet and I did not have any problems with executables.

after some googling on the new update, it would seem it causes conflicts with those good people who are using mods in additon to the cracked game.

I would expect not to have any issues since I've only updated the game with the Skidrow cracked updates.  So far, I have had no problems with the update or the new executables."
,poketama,2010-11-13T03:35Z,Jesus christ what the fuck is wrong with you OmniNegro?
,OmniNegro,2010-11-13T04:40Z,"@poketama

You do not always want a direct answer to what you ask. May I suggest you do do not want to hear my issues. They exist. I acknowledge them.

What has gotten me so very upset is that I have been trying to help people in these threads for months now and at first I was tired of giving the same damned answer that someone else gave a dozen times in a row.

Then I was starting to get pissed and noticed that if I am a total arse, people ACTUALLY read my posts. 

That is all I want. If you have problems and you actually read the advice you are given, you will find the solution in most cases. If not, then Google will probably tell you in a minute flat.

I have want to see even more such *Fun* threads, check out the Two Worlds II torrent by extremezone. Again, it is a good post and the solution to most issues is already in the comments. And again, I am a total arse. :)

Good day to everyone. Have fun. :) :) :) :)"

That's a bizarre fix. I was having the crashing issue as well, and have been using NVArchiveInvalidation. Turned it off and then back on, still crashing. But then I tried moving Fallout - Voices1.bsa to the front of the list and all better.

That doesn't make a lick of sense, but I'll take it. Thanks for the tip."

,OmniNegro,2010-11-14T19:52Z,"@Arse_Done_69

The problem is almost always the fact that you have integrated sound. Really. I am not joking.

Buy a *Real* soundcard and you will almost certainly not have that problem. I would almost bet my own computer that you have an integrated Realtek audio chipset.

Certain integrated chipsets work alright for gaming, and some do not. Try checking your motherboard manufacturer's website for driver updates for that chipset. That sometimes fixes the issue for some people.

Also, remember that despite what the manufacturer implies and in some cases actually tells you, *ALL* integrated audio chipsets put the load onto the CPU."

Lol. You suggest ""I"" am over-reacting? I am rude. Certainly. But find a post that I do not try to help. I will wait. :)

I will say it one more time. Somewhat paraphrased.

I am an arse to people because it makes them pay attention to my advice. I am trying to help. But it has been my experience that no-one ever listens to good advice unless you are a total and complete arsehole as well.

You make wild presumptions about me. I must be unemployed. Why? Because you say so. And you call me a fucking dickhead too. How productive. You show great promise as an aspiring troll. Be well nonetheless.

Now, a suggestion. Read the comments before you reply. I have never flamed anyone without reason. And I always try to help if I know of something that may help.

Sometimes I DO go too far. I know this. But there is no way to edit posts here.

Sorry. I do get carried away at times.

,deadspaced,2010-11-22T05:59Z,"The crack works fine. You won't be able to use NVSE if you use the crack from update 2. Here's how to get it working with the crack from update 3: 

Download Archiveinvalidation Invalidated from http://newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=37004

Copy over ArchiveInvalidationInvalidated!.bsa to your \Fallout New Vegas\Data\ directory and rename it to Fallout - ArchiveInvalidation.bsa.

Find your Fallout_default.ini and open it. In the SKIDROW version it is located in your \Fallout New Vegas\ directory. Inside, change ""bInvalidateOlderFiles=0"" to ""bInvalidateOlderFiles=1"". 

Once that is done, find the line starting with ""SArchiveList="" and add ""Fallout - ArchiveInvalidation.bsa"" after the equals sign (no space between) and IN FRONT of the other .bsa's. Placement IS important.

The line should look like this: ""SArchiveList=Fallout - ArchiveInvalidation.bsa, Fallout - Textures.bsa, Fallout - Textures2.bsa, Fallout - Meshes.bsa, Fallout - Voices1.bsa, Fallout - Sound.bsa,  Fallout - Misc.bsa""

Save your changes and load up NVSE. This should result in no more application load errors.

Calm down there, buddy. I can get you back up on your feet in no time! Download a program called 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org/). Got it installed? Good.

Navigate yourself to the folder with all those mysterious .rxx files. Find a file named ""sr-fnvu3.rar"". It should be the second from the bottom.

Right click > 7-Zip > Open Archive

Make sure you see three files: SKIDROW (folder), Fallout.New.Vegas.Update.3.exe and skidrow.nfo

Click ""Extract"", it should be a blue subtraction mark.

Go to where you extracted the files. Find the .exe. Run it.

Take ""FalloutNV"" and ""FalloutNVLauncher"" and replace them with the files that are in Fallout New Vegas directory.

Click either of them to start the game."
