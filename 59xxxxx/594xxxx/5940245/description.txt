iPartition 3.3.1 for 10.5+ released November 2, 2010

Fixed clone menu item.
Fixed a crash that you could get if you tried to view audio CDs
 (or virtual audio CDs).
 Note that iPartition cannot manipulate audio CDs;
 it just wonâ€™t crash now if you look at them.
Added the ability to specify cluster size when formatting FAT volumes.
Fixed the "Free space" property for FAT16 volumes.


iPartition 3.2.0 for 10.4.11+ released November 25, 2009

3.2.0 was the last official version to be tested and support 10.4.11+
Later versions no longer support Tiger; not tested on Tiger; may or may not work.

I have very slow Internet upload speed, so please be patient.
Please help continue seeding, cause I don't know how long and can keep this up by my own.
