Thanks for the encode(s)/upload.

@ ALL - STOP asking for REQUESTS. No matter how 'nicely' you put it - IT is a fucking request!

When 20-40 is accepting REQUESTS the notice will be REMOVED from his comment! Then and ONLY then ask nicely and he will do his best to please you. As he always does.

Basically, show some fucking respect!!!"

,killeurkilleur,2010-11-09T11:27Z,"i have to be honest with you... first off thanks for all your efforts to provide us quality vids. we really appreciate it. 

uhm...now i have to say, putting out 10 or 10 vids in one torrent was not really a great idea...now it's taking forever to download.... 

20 seeders 
150 leechers....seriously ???

i'm only downloading desperate housewives and it's still really really slow..."

..thank u"
,redriding,2010-11-09T18:59Z,"@killeurkilleur - seriously..... where do u get off... if you not happy, piss off and get your stuff elsewhere. Oh and if you are a guy I really worry that you are downloading desperate housewives.  Generally I dont judge but you are being a douche.

@Twentyforty, Thank you and know that Some of us actually appreciate what you do."
,cindal,2010-11-11T17:40Z,"Thanks so much, The Walking Dead and Dexter are so great! Also thanks for Lost Girl!
