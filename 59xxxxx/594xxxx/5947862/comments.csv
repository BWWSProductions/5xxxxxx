,ze.aralho,2010-11-12T20:10Z,"Thanks FXG. You rules!
I really want to see this one, but I have a doubt about the present torrent.
Is it just my file or in this version the audio is out of sync after 01:31:00?
Does anyone have the same problem with the file?

Again... thanks for the torrent, but, could you correct the file and upload a fixed one?"

Just a quick qs for anyone:

Im new to the whole downloading thing and im trying to create a dvd. Ive tried ConvertX which creates the DVD as a file but what can i use to create a proper film with menus, chapters, subtitles etc? Ive downloaded different types of films but can only create dvds as a file.

Help me please anyone? Thanks

,nocode99,2010-12-13T01:43Z,"Not sure why this is encoded to 42 khz, but convert it to 48 with Handbrake and all is good on the ps3"
,Beach_Ape,2010-12-18T04:52Z,"Lot of sycophants on the first page of comments, looking for real evaluations. Too many give 10's like dweebs getting laid in one of their rare moments. So far, sync is out on some comments, would like to know more."
,MrDc5,2010-12-19T02:27Z,Funny movie! Thanks FXG...the only issue with this movie is that the audio becomes out of sync about halfway through the movie. Other than that the quality is great. 
,coderX,2010-12-22T16:19Z,"Owch Curry44 that sucks! Make sure you limit your downloads. No more than 2 movies/ programs a week. And once you get done watching a movie and seeding it, back it up on a disc and delete it and remove the torrent, clear your recycling bin. They only crack down on excessive down loaders. "
