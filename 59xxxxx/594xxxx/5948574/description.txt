Manufacturer's Description
Enter a full-on crisis situation as you embark on a mission to locate and rescue a president's daughter who is being held by a bunch of trigger happy arms dealers. Packed with new games, cut scenes and a high-pressure two-player mode, Time Crisis 2 is a superb shooter that's more than double the size of the original coin-op. For added dramatics get the G-con 2 lightgun and feel the power of gunfire in every muscle of your hand.
