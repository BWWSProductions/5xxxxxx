,jindabyne,2010-11-10T20:56Z,Hey HR So glad to see that you are back! Your torrents are always guarenteed to be 10/10!
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-10T21:00Z,slight change in encoder profile for this release based on normal.  I watched the entire thing on Apple TV over wifi G.  It does skip a little here and there but it was watchable.  Over wire its perfect.  Should sync content to Apple TV 1 to watch it.  You can disable syncing if you want to try streaming only.  ATV 1 is rather wonk with streaming.  Apple I think in general is wonk with streaming.  Never works 100% perfect in my opinion.
,johnnyapplec,2010-11-10T23:06Z,Curious on the change in profile?  
,jake_samuals,2010-11-11T15:49Z,"HR, just a FYI, I have no issues on ATV1 over wifi when your encodes are re-ripped with Handbrake. ATV2, however, has a known problem of frame skipping when the buffer fills. Anticipating a firmware/OS update this month."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-11T18:03Z,that doesn't mean much to me.  hb settings are most likely wildly different.
