This is complete live coverage of the 2010 World Series of Poker Main Event Final Table from ESPN3.com.  There are NO holecards.  The entire first day of play at the Final Table is included here except for a period of 30 minutes towards the end of the evening when ESPN3 had to go off the air for Daylight Savings Time in the United States.  On Day One, the table played down to the final two players, at which time the action broke for the night, to be resumed Monday night.  On Monday night, the final two players will play heads up until the 2010 Champion is decided.

Day Two will be uploaded later.  Enjoy!
