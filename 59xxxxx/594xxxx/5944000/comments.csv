,jkitty,2010-11-09T19:59Z,"I stopped seeding the file this morning because I was showing over 40 seeders.  I'll start it again now.  It's a real file, assure you."
,deg666,2010-11-10T01:13Z,"FAKE!! FAKE!! FAKE!! FAKE!!
IT'S 2009 FINAL TABLE!!!"
,lwr0722003,2010-11-10T01:15Z,"Part 2 is the same as part 1, only its encoded at a very low resolution.

Please update so we can see the 2nd part.

Thanks!"
,jptwosix,2010-11-10T03:12Z,why are the files in .flv format?
,jkitty,2010-11-10T03:20Z,"These are ripped directly from ESPN3.com.  If Part 2 is incorrect, I apologise.  I'll fix it this evening when I return home."
,athosland,2010-11-10T11:17Z,"I can't preview the file, can someone confirm it's real or fake, thanks. "
,dhavhid,2010-11-10T16:23Z,"It´s FAKE it´s 2009 final table, and not 2010 as the name says

where can i find this year´s final table????"
,ka8iki,2010-11-10T16:51Z,"This is the real thing. In the beggining it shows a review of the 2009 table but then it shows the 2010 table. However, the part 2 video is the same with part 1, encoded in low resolution. (For me, part 1 video is damaged, it stops playing at 48% but part 2 works fine)
If possible, update the part 2 so we can watch it"
,snakeser,2010-11-10T18:52Z,the first part the 2010 coverage stars at minute 9:38 
,zurbur,2010-11-10T19:19Z,"As 'ka8iki' said, it is real, but part 1 stops working some time after 4 hours :( "
,Evil0n3,2010-11-11T14:37Z,"is every think OK with this file ???
+ download is very slow...can some one pls seed :("
,Trench000,2010-11-12T02:08Z,"
Whenever someone confirms that the second file is fixed, let us know and maybe we'll get some more seeders.  

Might be interesting to see ""the raw event"", but this download seems like it jumped the gun before having a quality download ready.
