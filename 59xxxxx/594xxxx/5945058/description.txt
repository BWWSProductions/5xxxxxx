President Obama arrived in Indonesia today on the second stop of a ten-day trip to Asia. It's Obama's first state visit to Indonesia after having lived there for four years as a child. We go to Jakarta to speak with investigative journalist and activist Allan Nairn, who has just released secret documents from Kopassus-the feared Indonesian special forces to which Obama has just restored funding.

- Widow of Poisoned Indonesian Human Rights Activist Munir Calls on Indonesia To Hold His Killers Responsible

We look at the case of Munir Thalib, an Indonesian human rights activist and a prominent critic of the Indonesian government and military. He was poisoned to death aboard a flight to Holland in September 2004. An off-duty pilot was found guilty for his death, but prosecutors ignored the findings of an independent investigation that pointed to the involvement of Indonesia's State Intelligence Agency. We speak with his widow, Suciwati Munir, who has led the struggle for justice in her husband's murder.
