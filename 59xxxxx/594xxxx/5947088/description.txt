Product Description
INXS formed in their native Australia in the late seventies and quickly established themselves as a great live band. It wasn t until the early
eighties that they began to break through as a recording act, first in Australia and then globally. Through the rest of the eighties and nineties
they filled stadiums around the world and released a constant stream of classic hit singles and best-selling albums. This INXS concert from
the Loreley Festival in Germany was filmed for the famous German TV series Rockpalast on June 21st 1997, just five months before the
tragic early death of lead singer Michael Hutchence on November 22nd. The DVD captures INXS on top form with a set list packed with
