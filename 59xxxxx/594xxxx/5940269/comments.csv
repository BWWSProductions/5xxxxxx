,greenteagod,2010-11-13T04:15Z,Does this one actually have proper subs or is it another screwed up copy?
,solanus,2011-02-08T06:58Z,Subs are great; quality is superb. Especially audio...wow.
,solanus,2011-02-08T06:59Z,I suppose I should note that a couple subs come up only for a split second - but you can probably fix that in the file. It's not a big issue.
,spunkedunken,2011-02-28T01:01Z,some screens would be good to back up quality control
