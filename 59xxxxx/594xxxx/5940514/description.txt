This is a conversion from a 10GB 1080p bluray HD of the actual German version
of Der Pianist 2002

It has a truly excellent picture for just 1GB fle size, noting it was converted
as well using DivX converter plus from the DivX website. Great bluray source
quality went into this offering!

The movie is dubbed for the most part of course as it was produced in English
in most of the speaking parts. 

We used 192k audio for booming sound quality and the video came in at 720 X 392
Although this means little compared to standard DVD cnversions to DivX as bluray
source yields a superior picture that will make you feel like you do in fact have
an HD movie worthy of bluray even! That said, this movie is formatted to play on even standard disc players.

We hope for no objections to our production of this movie file from the studios
as we think its only a sample of the 40GB on the bluray disc - on the other hand
you only need the huge file sizes if you plan to open your own movie theatre
underground perhaps - or a private club even better. Nonetheless, it gives
a good enough reason to seed free of not having a great excuse - this is not 
the same thing as on the disc as it is only meant for home sized viewing etc.
Seriously - its nice to have some excuses to offer as to why our versions are 
reasonable enough for all to have without the studios getting mad - we are sharing
a bit of history and culture artifacts for sober reflection as to the best way
forward in our existance as the best Christianly spirited folk we can be.

We have included the German srt contained in the mkv orginal file we obtained
and in addition we have an English SRT of the bluray versions of Der Pianist.

Cheers and good luck with the seed! (Danke)
