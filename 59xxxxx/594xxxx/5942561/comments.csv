[V],neon,2010-11-08T17:49Z,Good to see you back verifire :)
[T],verifire,2010-11-09T11:19Z,"Right on.. Thanks, mate. Love this place.. Geek enough to having bought pirate-ship T-shirt and two badges; piratbyran and ship..

Just had to..

Good to be back. Now all I've gotta do is try to find some decent stuff to upload.. It's like digging for gold in a laced mine.. There might be, ought to be a ore down there, branching out here and there, but first I've got to skim away all that crappy gold-dust and what have you..

Oh well.. Life..

Peace on you, Neo[n].. ;)"

I'm starting migrating to another site shortly, if God wants me to.
He may not. I'll know when I know.
Loads of work, though, but I'll try my best.

Still online, but how long? No idea.

@EVERYONE: If you want to have some of my uploads, or any other's uploads that makes sense and helps in some way on this journey toward eternity's dead-line;
MAKE HARDCOPIES!
Time is ticking by the nano-second, and it'll soon be up. WWW2 is here already, just try going to a online bank or something. Google WWW2. It's just a matter of TIME before it replaces WWW. Believe it.
Take to heart these words. You might be very glad one day if you did, and regret if you don't.

In love,
V.

PS: I blog occasionally, at: 'blog'- ending with 'spot'; 'Verifire's blog'. You might want to check it out. Or not. "
