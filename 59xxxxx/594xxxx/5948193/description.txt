1/6 - Nature Knows Best
Wallace and Gromit explore the wonders of the natural world and
look at inventions inspired by Mother Nature. We visit some
incredible flying penguins and other elegant Manta Ray-inspired
robots at Festo in Germany and visit Malawi, where scientists are
studying the intricate structures of termite mounds to create
self-cooling houses of the future.

In Holland we meet the brilliant sculptor Theo Jansen as he shows
us his latest amazing contraption, the Animaris Siamesis - a huge
insect-like structure that moves independently and gracefully with
the wind. In Israel, Jem Stansfield meets a man who has invented a
fish-like 'gill' which could allow humans to breathe underwater
and we look at some weird and wonderful fly-eating furniture based
on the Venus Fly Trap plant and other carnivorous plants. Finally,
Wallace, with the help of his friend Goronwy, gives us a run-down
of his top five animal-inspired inventions.
