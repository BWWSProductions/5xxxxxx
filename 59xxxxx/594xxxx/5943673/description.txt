"Mother Dearest"

Adrianna (Jessica Lowndes) has to un-invite Navid 
(Michael Steger) to her magazine premiere party 
after Victor (guest star Nestor Serrano) arranges 
for her to go with Joe Jonas (appearing as 
himself) to boost her image. Annie (Shenae 
Grimes) and Dixon (Tristan Wilds) visit their dad 
but are shocked when a woman answers the door. A 
series of mishaps lead Jen (Sara Foster) to 
conclude that she is a bad mother, so she makes a 
decision with Ryan (Ryan Eggold) and her son's 
best interest in mind. Naomi (AnnaLynne McCord) 
and Ivy (Gillian Zinser) team up to seek revenge 
on Oscar (guest star Balir Redford) with a plan 
that involves skinnydipping in the Beach Club 
pool. Navid discovers that his father may be 
using underage girls in his porn films and 
convinces Silver (Jessica Stroup) to go 
undercover.

Enjoy :)
