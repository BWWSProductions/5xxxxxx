,lobo345,2010-11-09T14:35Z,The show is not good as it used to be.
,chansee,2010-11-09T16:21Z,i agree lobo it seems like they got everyone excited with the whole drug aspect atleast me and everyone i know now its just drama. breaking bad needs to start season three yesterday!
,Glitch01,2010-11-09T19:40Z,"Yup, thanks again for the timely release.  And I also agree with what the other posters said about the series not being as good as it use to be.  That said, I am glad that there are still new episodes to watch.  Besides, series are better when watched one after the other instead of waiting for each week.  My cougar of a girlfriend and I are planning to watch this season again when all the episodes are in.  Maybe the season would seem better that way.  :)"
,ronnie11683,2010-11-09T22:42Z,This show has really sucked for 3 seasons now. I don't think it will last much longer. It's deviated so far from the Agrestic days.
