http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5892501/Kill_Speed_2010_720p_BluRay_x264-aAF
(That is the one that this one is a re-encode of)

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5905168/Kill_Speed_2010_Uncut_Bluray_720p_H264_jbr
(That one is even smaller than this one, and AFAICT is not a re-encode, so it would still be better quality than this crap)"

You think its RECODING if you take aAF bluray and encode it to BRRip? Well you're fool then. Its encoding, not re-encoding, maybe you should leanr some scene basics, idiot."
