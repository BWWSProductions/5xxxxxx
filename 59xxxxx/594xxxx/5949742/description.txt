The hard swinging energy of the late 1950s post-bebop scene served Sonny Stitt well, and this long-unavailable reissue shows why. Stitt comes out kicking on the tenor sax, the instrument that helped him define himself away from Charlie Parker in the early 1950s when the younger Stitt was a promising bop alto player. Pugilist references aside, The Champ blooms with Stitt smoldering on alto for "Sweet and Lovely" and then taking off again in a slack, strutting clip on "The Midgets." Trumpeter Joe Newman blows a fine, open trumpet, keeping his attack almost full-bore even when he uses a mute. Stitt, though, is the champ on this CD. He molds his tone to suit the supple stair-climb melody of "The Eternal Triangle," wringing every note for all its shades of blue.-Andrew Bartlett


[quote][color=red]Edward "Sonny" Stitt was born February 2, 1924 in Boston and died on July 22, 1982 in Washington, DC. He recorded from the late 1940s until a month prior to his death. Sonny Stitt's The Champ was originally released on the Muse Jazz label (Muse MCD 5429). It contains music recorded by Stitt on April 18, 1973, during a period when Stitt was enjoying a certain commercial success. Make no mistake, this music is vintage Bebop, from start to finish. It begins with Bebop maven Dizzy's "The Champ" and ends with what might be considered an opening shot into Hard Bop, "Walkin'". Stitt performs more on tenor than alto and is capable supported by the superb Duke Jordan on piano and Sam Jones on bass, Joe Newman on trumpet, and Roy Brooks on drums.
