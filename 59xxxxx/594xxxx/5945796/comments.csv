,keleieke,2010-11-17T02:37Z,Did making the piece size 512 make a difference?
,jackalope77,2010-11-17T03:22Z,"To be honest, I cant tell. In the past, I have simply uploaded slowly over a period of a couple weeks by limiting my bandwidth.  This time, in addition to changing the piece size, I took off the upload limit and seeded it as fast as I could.  As long as i keep my releases a couple weeks apart, Im not uploading any more than before but it makes it easier for people to get the movie.

So anyway im not sure which change made more if a difference, but i will continue to make them with 512 piece size in case it helps.

In the end though, they will just die out if seeders dont stick around which seems to be the usual story.  I have to delete them sometime...."

I think I know why djfred is MIA, but do you know about several other members of the NTSC crew?  It's like once they got the green skull, they quite.  Best wishes!"
,jackalope77,2010-11-21T07:46Z,"No idea what happened to everybody else.  Punisher and Seedkey are still uploading regularly, but ctang, omegafox and tater have fallen off the map.  Not sure why, since they usually uploaded really popular torrents which had no trouble keeping seeders.  I hope they come back soon, hard to find good ntsc rips, as im sure you know."
,lpedraja2002,2011-01-31T06:44Z,Hey thanks for this man.  I've been looking for this move for a long time. I will help seed this from my seed box so it should be healthy for quite a while.
