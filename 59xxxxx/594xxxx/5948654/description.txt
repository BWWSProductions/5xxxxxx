Uploaded on Remembrance (Veteran's) Day at 11am on the 11th of November 2010.   Millions of Men, Woman and Children have given there lives so you can lead the life you live today.   Had the Nazi's and there Axis Allies Won the 2nd World War, many of us (myself included) would not of been born.



Many of us would not be speaking English or our native tongue.   Many of us would be dubbed as racially impure.  The Poppy Fund helps those who they left behind, in all countries of the World and for all WARS.   Please spare a thought right now and donate whatever you can to the International Poppy Fund.   Thank you.
