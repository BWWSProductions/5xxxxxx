Lost: The Complete Sixth Season: DVD 5 of 5

This is the last of the five DVD's in the complete collection of Sixth and Final Season of LOST, which includes the following content:
#6.17: The End
#The New Man in Charge - The Epilogue to the LOST Saga
THE END: Crafting A Final Season - A featurette detailing production of the final season
A Hero's Journey - An analysis of LOST as a traditional journey of a mythological hero
See You In Another Life, Brotha - A featurette dedicated to the Flash-Sideways
Blooper reel
LOST on Location:
*LA X
*Recon
*Ab Aeterno
*The Candidate

As you might have noticed, this DVD does not include the deleted scenes. But don't blame me - that's because all physical Region 2 DVDs came that way! Also axed are the "LOST on Location" featurettes for "The Substitute" and "Happily Ever After" and one of the hidden Easter Eggs.

It looks like they needed more space for extra audio tracks, so somebody decided to remove the most interesting content behind "The New Man in Charge", which sucks so hard. If anyone can upload the Region 1 or Region 4 DVD, I encourage you to do so, lots of people would that you, myself included. In the meantime the only way I'm afraid the only way I can provide you the Deleted scenes is through this Youtube video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlc047AJdg8.
