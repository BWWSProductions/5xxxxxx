He speaks brazilian portuguese, and there are some differences.. I understood everything he said and i'm not brazilian.. ^^ Here's the translation:

""Are you crazy to roll windows 7 OS in your old pc but you can't? Your time has come, with this version of windows 7 ultra hyper mega lite!!
That's right, run windows 7 in your pc with less than 512mb. ""Perhaps it's time for you to put aside your windows xp. Even in low end pcs, with low resources, this OS has an excellent performance. There were some things removed from it to work on your old pc! It's an ideal OS for pcs or notebooks with low resources, occupying almost 4gb after installed in your hard drive and memory consumption of about 320mb, and this thanks to useless soft & apps removal."""
,jamesensor,2011-01-06T07:22Z,"...and probably going about the update window, one can download its language pack after OS installation, so everyone can understand it ^^

So, like... you install, then go to windows update, install english pack and you're done."
,wahrgelvskh,2011-03-11T15:23Z,"in short, the guy said: ""that does not have enough ram with windows 
to run on old PCs, this version will work. ""
