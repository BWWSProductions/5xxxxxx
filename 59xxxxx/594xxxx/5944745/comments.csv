,myhandle,2011-05-04T03:02Z,Aspect ratio is incorrect and the audio quality is deplorable. 
,Grass_Hopper,2011-06-27T19:54Z,"Any chance you can re-rip this with better quality sound and the correct aspect ratio?

It's great to download an mp4 that's 720p and only 700mb, just with the correct aspect ratio etc, this would be perfect."

Movie made me cry twice ;)"
,claimex,2011-08-13T12:07Z,lol your screens got tooken of do to tos violation and great quality! for such a small brrip file
,goonsy,2011-10-04T20:49Z,Superb.Thanks a lot
,thedivine1,2012-01-06T00:27Z,"Great quality.  Unfortunately the aspect ratio is set to approximately 2.35:1 whereas the original aspect ratio is 1.85:1.  This is can be remedied on PC with players such as VLC player, but will appear horizontally stretched (fat) when watched with other devices."
,violetflame,2012-01-26T21:45Z,"Picture looks great, but the audio is shite. Way too low of bitrate for AAC-LC (Low Complexity). Should Use Nero HE-AAC v2 if your gonna go that low.
You should pass on this one if you have good hearing.
Thanks anyway."
,LeBieque,2012-04-21T21:32Z,"No Audio nor AR problems, in fact, way above average quality. Thanks for providing mate."
