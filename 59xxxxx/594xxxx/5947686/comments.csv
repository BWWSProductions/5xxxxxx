,9Speed,2011-02-13T08:51Z,"I downloaded this torrent and would like to clarify a couple things:

Even though it does not say so in the description, these DVDs have been re-encoded and compressed from DVD 9s to DVD 5s.  Before someone tells me it's in the torrent title, ""remastered"" in the title refers to the digitally remastered boxed DVD release which included a few extras that weren't in the original VHS box. 

In addition, whoever did the re-encoding SKIPPED EPISODE 3, which is supposed to be on DVD 2, so you will need to download that episode separately.

Just thought I should warn you all before you download a 30GB torrent expecting the complete, uncompressed series like I did."

,Linuks,2011-07-25T09:01Z,"Damn, I should really have read those comments before starting the download and gone to bed. :/ Feels a bit useless now. :(
But Ill let it finish and hope everything is there, after all it says so in the nfo?"
,lrotger,2012-03-24T00:11Z,"I agree and further elaborate on 9Speed comments:

- menus are generally botched: I used MPC (Media Player Classic) and not VLC. Title menu goes to the language selection for the menus, which should appear only once at loading, to set the language for all menus. Title menu should go to the menu for the chapters and scene selection but for that you have to select 'root menu' which is again wrong
- episode 3 is indeed missing: 'play episode 3' goes to the same menu, where you can select play episode 3 again and again in an endless loop until the end of time. The chapter selection also goes nowhere - nice work, moron!
- resizing artifacts are visible in the letters at the beginning: ""COSMOS"" and ""A Personal Voyage"" and everywhere the image is static - again, sloppy work
- the images in all the 7 DVDs in the chapter selection have been deleted (why?!) and there is a list in the middle of the screen in an ugly font, all done without any taste
- the scene selection menu for DVD 6 has an error: the episode 11 does not have an update but it is listed. The update is in the episode 10!
- I don't know if there are more errors but one is enough: if you want to do the menus yourself at least do them right and, for extra points, better than the original, idiot! If you can't, leave them alone
- all subtitles have been deleted except the french and dutch: why?!? Did the universe shrink this morning?
- the menu clip shows some beautiful images but according to the general stupidity of this release, the real images, like two or three from the Hubble Deep Field, are shown for only 2 seconds, while a stupid 3D movie plays almost all the time instead of using the bits for the thousands of images of something real. Also, the tempo is too fast.
- There is only the english soundtrack. The track with the background music has been eliminated. Maybe it was useless, eh?
- subtitle, angle and chapter menus are active during DVD play but go nowhere

All in all, a terrible waste of bandwidth - how can there be seeders in this torrent, it's a disgrace. Get the one with hash 8479c0fbfda0d3cdbb6559e98e3531305fe61a10, at least it's the DVD7s without this retard's destuction (sorry 'remastering')"
