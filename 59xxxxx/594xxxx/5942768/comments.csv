,white_dools,2010-11-09T12:21Z,thanks...
,c0napelud0,2010-11-09T13:24Z,Thanks for upping this. I should say tho that the smaller filesize makes the picture a bit pixelated on a bigger screen. Still would say A 8; V 6
,listenherenow,2010-11-10T09:23Z,"Hey, 
  This is Ok the way it is.   But i converted it to DVD HQ 8000kbs and burned it to a multisession DVDR and played it in wide screen mode on a cheap ass dvix player on the big screen.

   it was excellent.  no kidding.   best version I have seen so far. 

 Really great.    

  Thanks a a million. "

I would have preferred a dvd rip, but this'll do."
