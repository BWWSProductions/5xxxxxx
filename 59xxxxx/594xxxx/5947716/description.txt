Release notes

No sooner had world-class megastar Rihanna wrapped up the final show of her
sold-out "Last Girl On Earth Tour" in Chicago last week, than she turned her
attention to her brand new fifth studio album on Def Jam Recordings. LOUD, set
to arrive on November 16th, has been described by insiders as a return to the
uptempo dance grooves of her earlier records

Setting the scene for LOUD is the first lead single, "Only Girl (In the World),
which went to radio and clubs September 7th. The uptempo track is produced by
Stargate, the Norwegian team whose career has been intertwined with Rihanna (and
her fellow Def Jam hitmaker Ne-Yo) since 2006, including "Unfaithful," Don't
Stop the Music," "Hate That I Love You" (featuring Ne-Yo), "Take a Bow," and her
most recent #1 global smash, "Rude Boy

Earlier this spring, the RIAA double-platinum "Rude Boy" (the fifth
multi-platinum certified song of Rihanna's career) hit #1 on a slew of charts
including Billboard's Hot 100 and Hot 100 Airplay, and MediaBase's Pop, Hot
Dance Radio, Hot Dance Clubs, Rhythm, and Urban charts. With "Rude Boy"'s
success, Rihanna became the first female artist of the past decade to chart six
1's on the Hot 100 - and tied Madonna in first place with seven #1's on the Hot
Dance Airplay chart (launched in 2003

Prior to "Rude Boy," 2009's "Russian Roulette" also made chart history for
Rihanna - as her 12th Billboard Hot 100 career hit, placing her second (after
Beyonce) among female Hot 100 artists in the decade since 2000. After "Rude
Boy," Rihanna was back on the charts as featured artist on Eminem's "Love the
Way You Lie" - which hit #1 on the Pop Songs Radio Airplay chart, and tied
Rihanna for the most #1's (six) on the chart, with Mariah Carey, Beyonce and
Lady Gaga

LOUD follows-up Rated R (November 2009) and its sequel Rated R: Remixed (May
2010). Previously, the double-platinum Good Girl Gone Bad (May 2007) contained
the Grammy-winning global #1 hit "Umbrella" (featuring Jay-Z), then "Shut Up and
Drive," "Hate That I Love You" (featuring Ne-Yo), and "Don't Stop the Music
The CDDVD package Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded (January 2009) continued the
hits with the #1 "Take A Bow," the #1 "Disturbia" and Top 20 "Rehab." Good Girl
Gone Bad was the third album release in less than two years by Barbados native
Rihanna, who turned 22 on February 20th. It followed-up 2006's RIAA platinum A
Girl Like Me, which contained the back-to-back hits, "S.O.S." and "Unfaithful
and her RIAA gold debut from 2005, Music Of the Sun, featuring the world-wide
smash, "Pon De Replay
