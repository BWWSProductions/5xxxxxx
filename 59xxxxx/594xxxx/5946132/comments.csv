,case39,2010-11-11T15:55Z,It didnÂ´t work to convert from mkv do a DVD with ConvertX. The program say it was a problem with the length!?! Anyone had the same problem?
,stedew,2010-11-11T16:44Z,Second DVD here : http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5949957
,lovelil,2010-11-12T11:51Z,"The info says this seed is 2.16 GB, I imagine the original is about 8GB, so it's got to have lost a lot of quality compared to the original...
No wonder someone said it's pixelated etc.
I don't see why the uploader didn't just upload the original full quality DVD, it would be so much better for everyone... "
,sgt.Maxcollin,2010-12-10T12:16Z,it is very pixelated and it gets a little annoying after a while if you like the quality got to the other torrent of 7GiB
