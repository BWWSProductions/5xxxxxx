Cake - Sick of You [promo 2010].mp4 



HQ 2010 promo music video. "Sick of You" is the name of the lead-off single from the alternative rock band Cake's sixth studio album, Showroom of Compassion. "Sick Of You" has been moderately successful so far, hitting number 11 on the US Alternative Songs chart. 

Lyrically, the song is about items that the band members of Cake hate. John McCrea said of the song, "It's about how when you hate things, the circle of hate starts rather broadly. You hate the President or a big movie star, someone you'll probably never meet. Gradually though, the circle tightens and the objects of hate get closer and closer to the hater. Now it's your uncle or your mother, now it's your close friend, and finally it's you. Bummer."
