Everything I know about d/loading for the DS is self taught from what i've learnt off the net and im starting to confuse myself I think! I bought 2 chips, called R4 upgrade revolution, about 6 months ago to get games for my children but more and more im finding the games dont work.  After a lot of research, and unsucsessfully trying to install Wood etc, I decided the problems im getting may be down to the chips themselves and have just bought an Acekard to try out...do you think I might have a bit more joy with this?  Im sorry to ask you all this but everyone on the forums ive been reading just seem so unfriendly and scathing to people who dont seem to know very much...like me :-S.  Thanks for your help, Linz x"
