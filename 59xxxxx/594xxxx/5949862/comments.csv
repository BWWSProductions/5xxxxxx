,Kidd_er,2010-12-20T23:19Z,how come I can only listen to the audio when I open the files?
,Kidd_er,2010-12-20T23:34Z,on utorrent im at 100% but it says its still seeding and when i open the files I can only listen to audio. do i have to wait till its totally done seeding for the video to work?
,st1ah,2010-12-22T21:04Z,can someone help me with this?
,Totbot3000,2010-12-23T04:47Z,"For the people only getting audio, you have to get a player that can play AVI files. I use Vuze to download and playback. Hope this helped"
,gfmickel,2010-12-23T14:36Z,"Yes.  Most media players (including WMP) play AVI files so I don't know why you're not getting video.  Make sure your codecs are uptodate for whatever media player you're using: WMP, DIVX, VLC, etc."

,xion900,2011-08-16T05:27Z,@JymzJameson you could if u had a 3D printer!
,civilitary,2011-08-19T20:06Z,@Jonny. THis might be too late but really all you need is some arm bands. Thats what I use but I would like dumbells. Plus not just one of dumbells will work you might need a set of 10s - 40s and that just cost to much for me. But on the bright side we're getting the workout free. These workouts is intense (atleast to me) so I'm pretty wore out without having weights. I recommend a pullup bar though
,TyMod,2011-08-21T19:16Z,"Thanks want to get in shape for next summer.  Was working out for football but had to switch schools.

Thanks a ton man!"

,DreamKush,2011-08-28T23:30Z,"at this moment i am barely downloading the videos im sure im not ready for the workouts but i need some workout ideas for weights.

@jonnyPaine7, i know they are pricey just make your own, sounds low budget but they work one gallon container filled with water or if you want more weight fill it up with dirt or sand and your good and it works"
,BirthRight,2011-08-30T10:28Z,"If anyone is interested in P90X you'll love the Shakeology program that Beach Body (the same developers of P90X) has. They carry supplements to get healthy along with The shakeology Shakes which come in chocolate and green berry =] here's a link: http://www.myshakeology.com/TonyMonster

and gfmickel Thank you very much for the torrent! =D thumbs up to your hard work!"
,TyMod,2011-08-30T22:30Z,"From what I read about Insanity it truely is freaking crazy anf has alot of health risk.  I'm not obese but I have Type 1 Diabetes and I'm wondering how crazy this one gets? I got issues as is, I don't need to goto the hospital because I passed out with low blood sugar...  Any info would help.  Just looking to loose 10 pounds or so."
,TyMod,2011-08-30T22:42Z,"to make this clear, I'm not like sickly or nothing so don't be like, oh you cant do it,  im just wondering if I can eat before doing it without barfing my balls off afterwards from over doing it.  Thats the biggest thing.  If I can eat before doing it then all is good. :)

sorry for the double post.  Just want to know before downloading 8 Gbs. Thanks again..."
,BirthRight,2011-09-02T11:39Z,"@Tymod 

'Course you can eat before, however make sure it's a small amount of food, as the real part of this, is the diet after the workout as well... you see, with the muscle confusion that P90X is all about you're building all that muscle but in order for it to take effect you must then open your body to better nutrients... Shakeology helps with that and helps you lose weight and get healthy faster as well... 

now back to your question, Yes P90X is pretty crazy, however INSANITY: THE ASYLUM is the next step ABOVE P90X, it's like this in simpler terms, P90X is highschool, INSANITY: THE ASYLUM is college. =P this torrent will help you of course in terms of getting fit, but you have to have a good diet included with it, just visit these websites and it'll show you everything you need to know about shakeology AND other things,

explore those websites and you'll find out even more, when to eat, what to eat, how to do the workouts etc! especially if you happen to sign up. you'll have access to all kinds of stuff! if it wasn't for Anthony, i'd be a stick in the mud doing my same old routine of laying in bed or on the couch and watching tv, WISHING I could do something"

Please either comment or email me at madlenanalbandyan@gmail.com. Your help is greatly appreciated :D"
,bling_soldier,2011-09-07T19:33Z,"@TyMod: Insanity is not that dangerous but it is really effective. If you are looking to loose 10 pounds then your better off doing something easy and calm. Insanity is more for getting the best out of your body. I am in the 7th week of insanity, i used to be 238 pounds before starting insanity, i never missed a workout and today i am 203 pounds and i can jump higher, i can bend much lower, i got muscles and much more stuff. Its really an extreme workout but i seriously doubt you'll faint while working out, you get enough rest and all so it won't affect you. "
,TyMod,2011-09-21T01:47Z,"Being 15 and 5 '11 at only 190 pounds i considered normal in weight man, I played football until I got diagnosed and ofcoarse after I had to quit football I started gaining weight again.  I got down to about 175 or so and was in good shape.  Now I got more blubber then I have had in years lol  I eat a good diet though.  Wheat everything and small portions (can't eat much because of my diabetes.) So thanks for the help.  I feel a little more reinssured now. :D"
