,helicon99,2010-11-22T07:38Z,"Worse upload ever!! Missing episodes 7 and 15 in season 5, video and audio are not sync'd for several episodes and some of the episodes are cut short before it ends.  If your going to do somthing like this make sure you know what the hell your doing or take time to make sure it works right considering the amount of time it takes to download this torrent.  I think it's great you took the time to upload but you may want to pay better attention next time you do somthing like this.  Thanks for the effort. -1, please do yourself a favor and find another source to download otherwise, you will be very disappointed if you download this torrent."
,straffkungen01,2010-11-30T20:12Z,"All is good. Look at the amount of files and you will find E7 and E15 on season 5. Audio is OK to nothing is outof sync. By the way; try to upload some shit on your own before you start talkin' ass about others. Don't know if your PC is havin' trouble with you or the files?

I think its you.....nOOb"

,Thizzy007,2011-01-28T08:02Z,"I have downloaded Season 1, 2, 3, and 4. I started about the beginning of December. It has taken a great while to download one season at a time, but at least this way I can watch something while I wait on the others to finish. 

I am very happy with the quality of the video and audio. It is like I am watching the episodes right from the DVD you would get in the box set. I am very pleased with this torrent so far and I am sure the rest will be awesome, except Season 8 because of the hard encoded subs. Thank you very much! 

I am about to start downloading Season 5, will report back since there has been a complaint about it. 

Thanks again to the person who uploaded this. Awesome! "
,Thizzy007,2011-02-04T12:53Z,Well I didn't download Season 5 from this torrent because of the un-unified file format. I only want .avi not a mix. Thanks anyways. I downloaded Season 5 from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5469386/Smallville_-_Season_1-8_Dvdrip and it is awesome quality. Thank you again.
