,Candy_Doll,2010-11-08T23:02Z,6 post and no preview
,joaosp,2010-11-09T15:41Z,I think we should protest his lack of a preview. I for one will NOT download his awesome pics of this gorgeous girl without a preview!!! I am just going to sit her and sulk... 
,Candy_Doll,2010-11-09T22:50Z,"it will just be my loss, no sulking.
i will not dl a model i never heard of.

whats curious is, when i used to post candydoll ( a well known agency) without a preview, the bitching was endless, as usual i guess im the @ssh0le here.
either way i could care less, i can get anything worth getting in a fraction of the time from usenet"
