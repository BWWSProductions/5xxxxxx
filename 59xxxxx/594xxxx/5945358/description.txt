Synopsis:
In his mockumentary, DOM JOLY'S HAPPY HOUR, the British comedian (and booze connoisseur) tours some of the world's favourite watering holes in search of foreign drinking habits. Whether he's in the Appalachian Mountains sampling moonshine with some hillbillies, or knocking back 80% proof homemade vodka in Russia, Joly manages to take in some of the local customs... as well as copious amounts of alcohol!
