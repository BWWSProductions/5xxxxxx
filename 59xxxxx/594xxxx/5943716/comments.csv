Should improve download time for everyone and new downloaders shouldn't have issue. :)
Sorry for the inconvenience. "
,iamjkthegreat,2010-11-10T04:29Z,so i got it all downloaded and did the launcher thing and got it working till it got to actual gameplay then my computer says it stopped working and had to close. i tried a few times and it does the same thing. any advice? i use windows 7
,whiteolorin,2010-11-10T05:20Z,It worked fine when I tested on Windows 7. :( Only issue I had was with antialiasing. Maybe you could make sure your graphics settings aren't overriding the game settings. Was only able to test on an Nvidia card. I don't know if ATI might have some issues.
,whiteolorin,2010-11-10T05:22Z,"When you open the Launcher, there's a configure button. Use that and try the Recommended settings. I may have forgotten to reset one of the settings files before I zipped it. :("
,iamjkthegreat,2010-11-10T23:31Z,"I'm not very computer smart, but i tried the configure recomended settings with and without the vsync. but still stops working right after the intro space words.Also tried scanning hardware and its all green except video which is yellow and idk how to fixx it :0 maybe my computer just suckss"
,JeroenTV,2010-11-19T20:52Z,"Hallo, i have a problem

i installed the game and i got this message:

Game requirements Met.
your current hardware configuration meets the game's required specifications. It does not, however, meet the reccomended specifications.

For a detailed report on your system configuration, clik on details.

When i click on details it becomes clear that my computer passes every hardware requirements except the VIDEO part. 

RDPDD Chained DD 2048MB:
graphics reccomended: ATI RADEON 9200 or better,  NVIDEA G-force4 TI or better. (128MB VRAM)

However, it says the VIDEO part did not pass the test of RECCOMENDED specifications for the game. But it does pass the test of the MINIMUM requirements. 

My question is: Is it possible for me to play this game..maybe in a less beautifull mode."
,j0sh91,2010-11-22T21:16Z,"Hi whiteolorin, uhmm I played the game, and I'm just at the cutscene with krei and Darth Sion. you know when he cut hher hand off, after that I walked back, heading to the fuel line level, but I returned back to the Main menu and I can't click on a thing, I just use it on Windows 7.."
,BBB985280,2010-11-26T22:34Z,"As soon as i click on the game it says that it is not working
any ideas??"
,solomon56,2010-11-28T13:32Z,"dude, ive really been looking forward to playing this game, ive finished the download, extracted it with winrar but theres no files for me to mount and an unusually large amount of files for a torrent 18,000+.  could do with your help!"
,Psychlops,2010-12-10T01:20Z,"Hy whiteolorin, just spent 10 hours download this, tried to extract and it says file may be corrupted or damaged.....any ideas?"
,neif181,2011-04-29T01:03Z,"i was able to create a character, but after the opening cut-scene ends, it shuts down.  Any help?"
,lordseafood,2011-05-08T16:24Z,"Yeah, I've got the same error occurring as nief181.

I can get through the character creation, the intro, then BAM, back to desktop.


Halp?"
,JohnD.,2011-05-31T05:28Z,"a little help please:
It works fine and all but how do i get the command prompt up for some cheats?"
,fazzer337,2011-06-19T15:26Z,I'd like to know the same as JohnD can you get the console up on this?
,jabadidi,2011-07-18T23:34Z,"very fast download and works perfectly,thanks!"
,LtWarhead,2011-07-28T14:31Z,Incredibly fast download and an awesome torrent! id like to now what restored content mod you used though thank you!
,spacemonkey74,2011-08-10T01:27Z,"I downloaded it fine and unzipped it, but when I try to run it from the launcher nothing happens, I just get the thinking symbol on the mouse for a few seconds then nothing. Running Vista. I have played with the config settings but that hasn't helped."
,spacemonkey74,2011-08-10T06:56Z,"Never mind i found a vista patch for the game here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4990017 and also set it to run in win xp sp2 compatibility, works fine now."
,shakesbeard,2011-12-21T02:28Z,Fails after character creation
,gary5393,2012-06-30T09:54Z,"this is a fix for people who crash after character creation im using vista so this is most likely why its crashing its a old game so what you have to do is download that vista fix so it lets you start the game then you have to go to the application in the kotor 2 folder (its like swkotor2.exe) and hit properties then go to compatibility and switch it to run as windows xp then you have to create a new shortcut to that application and make that compatible to xp the same way and so far that has fix the problem but im only a few hours in the game and here is a url for the maybe better instructions
