great quality & file size!!

please do all the others"
,michaelrwatson,2011-08-11T07:49Z,"A8, V8.... for a 1.37GB x264 file..?!! 

WAF, sadbawang--You are fucktards. There are ~300MB 352p versions of the original Apes series, and the quality is *great*. Hence, this one is 5X as big as it needs to be. For this filesize, the quality should be *at least* 10/10. "
,michaelrwatson,2011-08-11T07:51Z,"Also, please don't create .mkv files. MKV is crap. Use .MP4 (or else .AVI) instead."
,Flaminhaz,2011-08-13T23:13Z,"Wow, michaelrwatson you are an idiot. Making a 300MB is clearly not better, just a substitute. MKV is also superior to .mp4 and .avi so I don't know where you got that from."
