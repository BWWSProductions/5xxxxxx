,BrowndRemastered,2010-11-17T09:52Z,"Is this the 96KHz/24bit version? 'Cause it looks too heavy for a regular flac release. If so, is it the limited or the unlimited version? (please tell me it's the unlimited :D)"
[T],antz172,2010-11-17T13:22Z,Yes this is the 24bit 96kHz unlimited version

,CrVMo,2011-03-11T02:54Z,"Hi.
Please can you tell me why the file is so large - compared with other FLAC albums I've found, which are c.250MB sized.
Many thanks for explaining - and the great album!
