,Jabdy69,2010-11-18T15:49Z,Is this the Clean or Dirty Version ??
,Jabdy69,2010-11-18T19:34Z,It's Clean....hope u upload the Explicit Version soon
[V],jainmehul,2010-11-19T14:28Z,"@Jabdy69 :-
i prefer uploading stuff that directly comes from CD and this is one of them.... and CD versions aren't normally explict (i'm guessing) and if u want the explict version grab this one :-
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5954298/Rihanna_Loud_%5BiTunes_Bonus_Track_Version%5D
its from itunes and generally itunes provide explict versions... 
Although i would recommend u this one... it directly comes from CD...."
