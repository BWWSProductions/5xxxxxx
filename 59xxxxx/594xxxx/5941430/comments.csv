,captainpetey12,2011-01-12T12:55Z,Hey guys I'm having the same problem. It says insert the correct cd and restart the game. I tried both burning the image to cd and of course just mounting it with the same result. Any help would be great. Thanks for the up ! 
,tbraybrook,2011-05-30T00:21Z,Downloading this now. Not sure how I am supposed to burn a .7z file to a disc as an image file though. It isn't an image file. 
,tbraybrook,2011-05-30T05:25Z,"Doh! Finally got it figured out. First off I had a brain fart. The image file of course is inside the .7z file which I unpacked with WinZip Pro. After you burn the Image file which took some time because Magic ISO did not like the file so I used another program, I used the setup button to install it after reading the disc image with ISO Buster. I think that is what I did! lol Yes you WILL get the message to insert the CD ROM."
,tbraybrook,2011-05-30T05:56Z,"I found a patch for it that needs to be downloaded from megagames but it appears I am not allowed to post the link here.
Once you unzip it, copy and paste the PB.exe file into the ""System"" Folder that is inside the Adventure Pinball Forgotten Island folder. Run and install it. It will read info from your PC as to the best game settings. You will then be able to play it without being prompted for the CD.
YES, on original install you will probably need the code provided by codyblue however there will be a serial that can be used inside the EReg folder. SN.txt"
