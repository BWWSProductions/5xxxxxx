,nashdracula1,2011-03-30T01:13Z,You guys are noobs. if you dont know how to use cracks and mount iso's then dont download!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,soco316,2011-03-30T05:52Z,"I'm a total noob, and had the same problems everyone else was having. Follow these steps and it should work fine. I first created two folders on my desktop, one for the game, and one for the cracks. I then extracted the game to the game folder, and the cracks to the crack folder. Then I ran the setup that is in the game folder. After it installed, I moved the two cracks from the crack folder to ""The Creative Assembly"" folder found in Program Files (x86). Inside this folder, there is a folder that says Rome - Total War. Select both cracks and move them into this folder. You will be asked if you want to replace the files that are in the folder. Select yes. I tried running the game without replacing these files and I got the same ""missing disk"" message a lot of U R getting. After I replaced the existing files, the game runs fine. BTW, I'm running Windows 7. Great download, props anton13. Will seed for a long time. "
,Rhyden,2011-04-08T20:43Z,"If your getting the ""Select from List"" error when trying to play Barbarian Invasion you need to download the 1.6 crack from GameCopyWorld."

,diggerRACT,2011-05-12T13:02Z,gday it was the first time i have downloaded a game and i had next to no drama's with doing it good upload anton cheers mate. thanks to soco316 i followed his instructions and got it straight away... one thing i will say the main campaign on BI doesnt work for some reason. and the campaign on the normal rome crashed and seems to do it in the same time every time windows has drama's with it anyway cheers again good learning curve for me anyway
,N00bdownloader,2011-05-17T11:04Z,"hey im kinda ne to downloading games, i followed soco316 but i am now stuck. i cant find the creative assembly thing so i cant do anything. i have a windows 7 if it helps :)"
,ChiefChongo420,2011-05-21T05:26Z,"I did everything, including downloading the 1.6 crack, and I'm still getting ""Please insert correct CD-ROM,"" or the missing .DLL message. What do I do? I need an iso to mount!"
,fomorian27,2011-05-22T02:11Z,"I figured out a fix for the Barbarian invasion 'select item from list' message. What you need to do is download the following torrent:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4171388/Rome_Total_War_%28including_Barbarian_Invasion__amp__Alexander%29

No need to reinstall the original rome total war or even the barbarian invasion, but you can install the alexander expansion if you want to complete the set. What you need to do to get BI working is take the Barbarian invasion file from the cracks folder, and replace the barbarian invasion file in the installation directory. For some reason this worked for me. "
,Xkul,2011-06-05T13:32Z,"wow lol best total war torrent i've seen. no need to mount or anything. installed in like 3 mins.

,lovemydog,2012-04-04T05:29Z,"Thank you, thank you, thank you! Used soco316's (pg 2) installation instructions and it was easy as pie, no ISO mounting required, worked like a charm and I was playing right away. PROTIP: This may be helpful if you've never played this game before- you can't save your game until you've finished the prologue/tutorial section, the ""save game"" button will be grayed out. I thought it had something to do with this dl but no, it is the way the game was made so don't start playing until you can commit about an hour or so, otherwise you won't be able to save your progress."
