,ghsodt,2010-11-14T22:58Z,"Legit, just downloaded it quickly (155kbps - I limit the rate there were about 50 peers - Transmission doesn't show the full list so there are probably more)

I do think its weird that TPB is showing the number seed 0/0 but maybe its all DHT. Anyway I got linked to this from mrtwigg and the file is on my computer and I previewed it and it was good sound and picture... So whoever is saying it is fake is either a scammer or just someone who doesn't know how to use torrents properly.

Share and share alike P2P community Love!"
