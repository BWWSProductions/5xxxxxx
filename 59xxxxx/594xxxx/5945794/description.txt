"Two Steps From Hell is a production music company based in Santa Monica, California. Founded by Nick Phoenix and Thomas J. Bergersen, the company produces music for movie trailers.

In particular, the group's music has been used in trailers for such films as Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Star Trek, The Dark Knight, 2012, X-Men: The Last Stand, Tron Legacy, Avatar, Prince of Persia, Stardust, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Inception and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader as well as video games such as Mass Effect 2 and the British television show Doctor Who.

Of their albums, only Invincible has been released to the public. Illusions, formerly known as Nemesis II, will be released publicly under Bergersen's name."

In my opinion, this is the the best of all the production studios. Also popular and extremely talented are E.S. Posthumus, Immediate Music, Globus, and X-Ray Dog.
