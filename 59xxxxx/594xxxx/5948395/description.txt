Hi there..


I've downloaded the mp3's from this album from Don and Wendy Francisco's website, tagged them properly, and added a "bonustrack", a brand new song.


Here's what Don and Wendy says on their website as to copying their music:


================================

Can I Make Copies Of Your CDs ??

================================
	
Because our music is intended to reach people for Jesus, we enthusiastically encourage people to buy our CDs as gifts, or to make copies and give them away. If you make a copy of our CDs, all we ask is that you write our URL:
 
www.donfrancisco.com, or 
 
www.wendyfrancisco.com
 
on the disks you give away.

You can prayerfully make a donation for copies
on our CD Store Page if God so leads.

Please remember that this is our desire for our
ministry and God has enabled us to do it.
Other musicians may have a different policy.

We do not give permission for
unauthorized reproduction for resale.

Thank you!
Don & Wendy Francisco

================================

No.. Thank YOU, Don and Wendy.

Not many have taken much notice of the Word; "For nothing you have received [it], now freely give.."

But you have.


Regards,
V.
