""-1"" from usual idiot has been given. That guy must poop on my torrents, and he often comes back, switching proxy servers and logging in, do his ""number 2"" and run away.

ROFL. I can expect more minuses."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-11T20:04Z,As predicted - second minus from same guy.
,redvanilla,2010-11-11T21:32Z,"@twentyforty: Never mind the idiots (IÂ´m still working on that one ....)
Well, good thing is - it also works with ""+1"" - even better!
Have a nice evening"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-11T22:44Z,"@redvanilla; During this summer, due to ""cucumber season"" I guess, one of the three regular morons (for now) clicked during one frikkin night 48 times on ""-"". 

Well, I must say, I've never seen that before (my old ""home"" had just ""Thanks"" button and normal comments-section) and I was caught I admit. Then I connected TPB with few things and realized that this would come with territory. 

It fits very nice with behavior of few moderators and few uploaders, who haven't found nothing more productive than to come here and shit all over my living room.

But this guy are relentless. Back to the summer story... It was torrent of some requested movie and therefore downladed 76 times. That guy continued with clicking game whole day long and I, seeing that, inserted a scriptlet, in page: Every time when specific members click on minus - scriptlet automatically add TWO pluses... LOL-

Do you think that he have noticed that? LOL, no fucking way - he continued to click - hard to believe - 289 times! During one day! and he never looked how with every click he add two pluses too! 

Day finished with his few hundred minuses but also with (I guess) around 700 pluses! All added by his own hand. ROFL!

Thank you for support. That separates us from lunatics."
