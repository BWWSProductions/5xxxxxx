,NXiL2009,2010-12-08T22:44Z,I'm having a regular problem with your downloads missing the audio codec.  Is it something I'm doing?  I'm downloading the entire file.  It is not happening all the time.
,KevMovieMan,2010-12-09T14:47Z,"@ NXiL2009

R u trying to merge both files with VirtualDub? You might end up losing some or even all of the audio if you mess up on that end, if so jus google a step by step tutorial 4 it. (very easy by the way)

If not... well what media player u using? U may have to either update or change it... personally I never have problems with ARROW releases so I can't offer much help 4 this, so good luck with getting the audio 2 wrk."
,bonzai37,2010-12-14T01:59Z,"Thanks!!!

NXiL2009 use VLC Media Player or Media Player Classic. They come with just about all the codecs you will need."

,TheGriffinman,2011-05-28T20:08Z,"Why two files?  Sucks when trying to stream it to my TV...  What's a good program to use for merging, I mean, something better than Windows Movie Maker.  Can a program in CS5 do this?"
