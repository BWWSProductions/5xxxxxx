,ShaneJc,2011-01-21T06:55Z,"The Keygen has a virus in it detected by Avira. The virus is ""TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen2"". which is a malicious virus.

,YamiKuro,2011-04-24T06:59Z,"Thank you very much for the upload djj.
For anyone doubting the torrent, Avast! (my A/V) does not detect anything (warns that I should open in sandbox in case it's malicious but yeah...)
It is installed and working great.
I also blocked it from connecting to the internet while installing (it tries about three times)

Win7 x64
Avast! Free
Comodo Firewall"

,MrJohnMark21,2011-05-16T17:15Z,SEEDDDDDD....... and can it be cured the virus?
,kerrypeterstevens,2011-05-25T11:29Z,"OK, got it & it Works
But, having problems using it ?
It automatically keeps installing hundreds of Shortcuts = very starnge.
Could be that the File Managre Program I use ""Cubic Explorer"" & Object Dock don't work well together ?"
,wise5,2011-06-06T16:20Z,"I have some experience with keygens so it's safe to say this keygen gives a false positive. the reason it most of the time registers as a virus is because it bypassing of product registration and activation, or to software piracy in general. So in most countries, the use of keygens to activate software without purchasing a license is fraudulent.

if the fact that you are getting a false positive and getting worried let me enlighten you on what symantec (aka Norton) has to say about the false positive:

Trojan.Gen
Risk Level 1: Very Low

Trojan.Gen is a generic detection for many individual but varied Trojans for which specific definitions have not been created. A generic detection is used because it protects against many Trojans that share similar characteristics.

as you can see Norton says this is a generic warning. i hope that put your minds at ease.

By the way Nice upload djjlicious"
,isebastein,2011-06-29T09:01Z,"Hey, guys, question. is this really safe? I downloaded it, no virus detected, but the keygen failed didn't work. what's shareware? xD a program called ""shareware.exe"" opened up while it was installing, it tried to take the name of another program that was already running. when this was installing, I had my anti-virus (Avast!) scan, disabled the internet. when I  didn't feel safe about this, I  tried to delete stardock and the download but it kept saying ""file is open in another program"" it was open with explorer.exe, there was 2 of those open for some reason. o_O closed those out, was able to delete stardock. then was able to run explorer.exe again, as far as I can tell computer is fine, but some windows programs open all the time when I open other programs, like ""rundll32"" and ""searchprotocolhost"" ""taskhost""  sorry if I rambled alot. I'm just paranoid :/ I've read some of stories about torrents like this and peoples computers get screwed by hackers that get access via viruses.  I doubt there is a virus, according to everyone else that downloaded this say it's safe, but can't always trust what others say. like I said, I'm just Paranoid and scared about getting a virus xD. "
,isebastein,2011-06-29T09:02Z, keygen failed and didn't work* 
,brickedmeat123,2011-07-04T02:04Z,"Keygen is a patcher... no wonder it's a virus... but my ESET Nod32 didn't detect anything... seems to be clean so far... gonna go to VT and scan this... I'm going to give you the link.

CAT-QuickHeal says this is a HackTool.Patcher.j (Not a Virus). Others says it's a keygen or a suspicious keygen... then some Patcher, a variant of win32 (detected by NOD32, but in mine it doesn't?) and others. I suggest you be careful of this keygen..."

,tiira,2011-07-27T10:45Z,"I tried to install it and it worked perfect. But when I turned it off and then on it didn't work. And I didn't find it when I searched for it in the 'start menu'.

,Dipper926,2012-02-25T20:28Z,"---Need Help Due to Avast! AntiVirus bug--
I know for 100% fact this works.
I know for 100% fact this is not a virus.
--- Because I've used this same torrent before, and it worked and everything.

But this was on another PC, this was on my Windows Vista laptop AND Windows 7 desktop way back.

But back then I only had AVG Anti-Virus, and it didn't flag as a virus.

I now have Avast! AntiVirus, and of course, as with 90% of all Keygen's it flags a virus, which I know is a false positive.

The problem is, even after hitting ignore, and ""run normally"" this will not open, even under ""Run as Administrator""

It will not open even after uninstalling Avast!, I wiped all trace of the AV from my system, and retried. 

I know this works, and am not new to torrents, of any kind, games, programs etc.

As a matter of fact, since this had worked, I backed it up to an external USB hard drive. about a year later I open the file from my hard drive, and try to install. It works, but when trying to keygen patcher, it will not open the file after telling Avast! to ignore it.

Currently, I do not even -have- Avast! installed, and as I've said, it will not open.

Does anyone have an idea how to fix the bug from the AV? 
--- I assume I'd need to go into Avast!'s settings, meaning first I need to reinstall it.

And yes, I've tried redownloading, reinstalling, and all else. This is annoying me like hell...

Any help?"
