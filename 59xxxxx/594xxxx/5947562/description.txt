he kappa, in Japanese folklore, are water goblins
that are closely associated with a certain town
in the country. Unfortunately, the area is also
home to a militant splinter group of researchers
dedicated to developing amphibious super soldiers
based on the kappa of legends. When their
experiments result in murders by some escapees,
the appearance of an actual kappa, and the
triggering of an atomic bomb, the consequences
are of epic proportions. A monster arrives in the
midst of the nuclear fallout, and Japan's
defenses are helpless against it. Mankind's only
savior is an irradiated water goblin that is on
the rampage with death in its eyes. DEATH KAPPA
is a throwback to old-style kaiju films by
writer/director Tomoo Haraguchi.
