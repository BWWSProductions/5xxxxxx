Downloading another torrent..."
,erwin.vip,2010-11-08T15:52Z,"@teempla
just download a new player.
KMP plus recommended"
,Space2099,2010-11-08T16:00Z,The other torrent has the same audio problem.
,Orion1986,2010-11-08T17:07Z,"@Teempla
I had the same issue with big video files. And then i changed computers. Im guessing u dont have the best PC specs, and if u want to play big files u cant do that on and old computer. No player will change that. Id recommend downloading a smaller file, less res basically."
,holabandola2,2010-11-08T20:19Z,"Thanks, another great torrent. As always"

,HollywoodIsAlive,2010-11-08T23:41Z,"why is it that this file is taking like 6 hours to d/l
i always use eztv and its done within half hour :s"
,HollywoodIsAlive,2010-11-08T23:45Z,anyone know how i can make this download quicker?
,Fassto,2010-11-09T06:22Z,"I cant open the file, I have all the codecs but still cant see it, anyone know what happens?"
,shano73,2010-11-09T13:21Z,"@ most of the above
There is no prob with this file, or part 1, eztv reliable as always... I always use vlc player(free, just google it!)  to play any movies on comp and it works fine, but I have noticed that latest update of vlc has a little lag when skipping forward or back in time, but it settles down in a few secs...
@ eztv, thanks again, will wait for EP03 in a week ;)"
,skreemer,2010-11-12T22:04Z,"thanks, eztv!
