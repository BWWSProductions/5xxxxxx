,moshster,2010-11-10T22:18Z,hard subs for Naavi parts?
[V],-jonny-,2010-11-11T00:13Z,Great upload. Shame you upload anonymously.
,autobotHD,2010-11-11T00:34Z,"Two subtitles available.
1st -forced(not hardcoded) english sub for naavi parts only

2nd -english for the whole movie"
,hello40204,2010-11-11T10:17Z,"this is nice. when can we expect the full blu-ray ?
jonny why don't you upload the full blu-ray . that would be constructive "
[V],-jonny-,2010-11-11T11:32Z,lol. go buy it.
,iridis_alpha,2010-11-11T18:56Z,is this version now in its full widescreen ratio as the original release of this was cut down to 16:9 ratio?

,c3bhm,2010-11-29T23:43Z,Get the .mp4 Kingdom release.  720p quality at LESS THAN HALF THIS ONE's FILESIZE.
,c3bhm,2010-11-29T23:52Z,Get the .mp4 Kingdom release of this new extended version. It's truly 720p but only 3 gigs.  They are by far the best encoders out there.
,ianberke,2010-12-05T23:01Z,"could we please get some more seeders, im seeding at 300kb/s but i cant do that if i cant download it myself"
,kyrax2011,2010-12-08T22:59Z,"would you please seed, i'm stuck on 88.3% downloading at 5kb/s"
,justin131,2010-12-13T06:55Z,"@c3bhm:

This has 1509kbps DTS audio whereas the kingdom release has 334kbps AAC audio and this has double the video bitrate. The kingdom release is far from better.

If you want a high definition copy, short of buying the blu ray, this is the best you can get.

Bitrate is far more important than resolution.

BestHD > Kingdom > 700-1370mb rips

Also, the source used to for the kingdom release is THIS release lol.

P.S. I aim to inform, not provoke. :)"

,xXDJMXx,2011-03-06T21:55Z,So how do I activate the subs? sorta new to pirating movies :S but just for the Na'vi parts
,Mathlol,2011-03-10T20:59Z,"Best rip out there.  
Yes, I have looked through over a dozen promising ones, even passed over my usual takes since a movie of this caliber can't be limited by size.  Yes, perhaps that 18gb upload might have better quality but you're only fooling yourself if you think it would be visible without a projector on screen."
,deftond,2011-03-16T16:25Z,"great quality.  I also downloaded the 1080p version and deleted it because this one seemed just about good enough on a 42"" Tv.  If I had a 50"" I probly would have kept it."

Perfect video and sound, best torrent I've found so far. Others have compressed them to save on space but it sacrifices quality. Sure this is 8GB but it's so worth it; it's movies like this where HD truly shines."
