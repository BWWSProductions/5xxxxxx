,shifty420,2010-11-10T22:39Z,@shan1992 heh your statement took more effort than actually posting an a/v score. who gives a shit if someone asks for a/v its common practice around here. 
,MoviesR101,2010-11-12T00:46Z,Where Are The Dvdrips or BRRIP's? 
,thecompleteguitarist,2010-11-12T12:42Z,Not DVD quality and it's (cropped to) 4:3 but it's very watchable. The entertainment always transcends the quality of the reproduction in my opinion.
,mgd37,2010-11-12T18:43Z,"Thanks for this topic, IwannaFan2."

,paulqr71,2010-11-21T19:57Z,"A/9  V/zero  I have nothing but audio, and a white screen.  VLC isn't decoding the video.  What gives, this blows. PPVRip my butt!"
,fucko31243,2010-11-22T07:14Z,"You morons that downloaded it and then complain that its not dvd quality, maybe you should have just viewed the images first and save the bandwidth, you can tell its not a dvd from the images, maybe instead of running your dumb mouths you should have used that dumb brain first, thats what the images are for dickheads lol."
,Spantrekker,2010-11-22T09:25Z,'Fucko31243' Have you ever considered anger management classes? You clearly have a few issues that need resolving. Such pent up aggression is not good!
,zareli50,2010-11-22T14:39Z,"Any body else get hatemail from ISP and NBC Universal, kinda spooky."
,fucko31243,2010-11-22T15:29Z,"@Spantrekker actually i never said anything that bad, if you think someone that says dickhead needs therapy then maybe you should get some yourself, what i said was true, who downloads a movie without checking out the image quality first, i can understand that your mum and dad pay for yours but most people prefer not to waste it, so maybe you can SHUT THE HOLE UNDER YOUR NOSE NOW like a good little chump. Bye bye now :o)"

,MoviesR101,2010-11-24T03:32Z,"@ aldrinstryder - If you read the title (PPVRip), look at the images provided by IwannaFan2 and read the comments you can figure out that this is Not Dvdrip! It is Watchable If You Can't Wait For Dvdrip or BRRip!"
