Made the file smaller and the audio sounds a bit louder,as for the others not heard them!"
,BigLloyd,2010-11-11T13:18Z,"Thats a good way of avoiding the question pshtonka! lol
Anyone with comments on audio?"
,aquavern,2010-11-11T13:41Z,"I've been trying to DL this file all night. Why ppl upload and then not seed is beyond me.
I want to at least DL enough to preview it seeing there is no sample. I'll comment on audio as soon as I get enough to watch."
[T],pshtonka,2010-11-11T15:40Z,"aquavern
Sorry been havin connection probs at moment,and i always seed what i upload.
Please do coment on v/a."
,aquavern,2010-11-12T00:42Z,"I still haven't gotten this. Stuck @ 58%
And VLC wont let me preview what I got for some reason.
If you could tell me straight up what source you used I would know if it's Mic audio or not. Save a lot of waiting."
,aquavern,2010-11-12T13:19Z,"Hey...I finally got it!  ; )

Same Mic audio....but sounds a little better than the others I've heard. Also I think the aspect ratio might be off. I think it's 3:2. I reset to 16:9 and it looks much better.

V=9
A=5


Thanx UL'er"
