Design your own first person shooter games

Build FPS games with ease

We're proud of the game building environment we have created for you. Gone is the tedious task of hollowing out cubes just to make a room, or having to know a programming language inside out. Our fully graphical Windows based editor allows you to literally paint your maps with pixel perfect 3D precision and create great looking scenes like these in a matter of minutes:

And when you've got things placed where you want them you can drop in weapons, enemies, objectives, trigger zones, customise the loading screens, create your own AI scripts, draw some waypoint paths, set-up some gorgeous lighting effects and then a single click of the mouse will turn it all into an EXE file you can pass to your friends.

What they fail to tell you:
Its buggy as hell, they no longer allow people to post custom stuff on their forum unless you buy their product and they will flame you off it if its any good.
