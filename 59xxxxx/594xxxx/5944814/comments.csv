,taxentaxen,2012-05-10T06:24Z,"This rip is exactly the same, I mean, BIT BY BIT IDENTICAL to the one included in this torrent: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5909284/Law__amp__Order_COMPLETE_All_20_Seasons
Don't know why gcjm released it as if it is his own rip and never mentioned anything.
If you already have the complete set, downloading gcjm season 3 is completely waste of your time and resources.
Be warned!"
