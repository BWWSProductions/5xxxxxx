A couple early Lady Gaga demo CDs, which I got from gagafrontrow.net
Dirty Rich (versions Paparazzi, BDR, Disco Heaven) - .m4a
Kandy Life (version of BDR, Wonderful, Kandy Life, Brown Eyes and Disco Heaven) - .mp3, except for the title track, which is in lossless .m4a

A few demo versions of songs from The Fame and The Fame Monster as well.
