Any chance of keeping this up for longer than 48hrs please?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-08T13:39Z,"@DMVIN: Hardly, not because I wont, but because I operate with one single seeding slot. Second one is ""down"" for a day, and I don't know when he will be operational again."

,DMVIN,2010-11-08T14:34Z,"well thanks for considering. 

Guys who download this pls seed as there are some of us with pathetic speeds who need your help."
,jon4fun,2010-11-08T14:54Z,"@ ALL - I'm going to say this because a few of you idiots seem to think/believe that when 20-40 says at the TOP of his schedule:

[REQUESTS ARE ""FROZEN"" (AGAIN)]

that this does NOT apply to YOU because you are fucking special or something.

20-40 would not write the statement, in CAPITALS, if he didn't mean it so read his comments and stop being idiots!!!!!!!!!!

Jon"

,freeholay,2011-04-06T21:15Z,"Files are .mp4 

Avoid these types of files as most are just containers for bad rips. AVI is always just what they say to be so look for those instead. Some mp4 do contain good codec use but it's extremely rare.

Thanks to the uploader for making it clear in this instance that the encoding is odd ... will not play well on most computers, specially not cpu machines that are not brand new as of 2011"
