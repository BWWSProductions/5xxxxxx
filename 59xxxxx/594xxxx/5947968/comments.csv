When i want to play the multiplayer, I click on Team Death Match and then its searching for a game and finally it freeze.. Anyone can help me?:$"
,123tankey123,2010-11-14T12:33Z,"PS. This ISO works on DriveKey.
This game contains also update, so you need to remove those first before burning on disc."
,karliboy,2010-11-14T18:04Z,how do i do that tankey m8?
,123tankey123,2010-11-14T20:55Z,"You only need to remove updates when you used a software mod for hacking your WII.

You can use Brickblocker for removing the updates
( http://wbb.rockman18.com/?page=download&ln=en )

or WIU1.1 Region Patcher

( http://www.nextgenboards.com/vb/wii-hacking-and-modding/10286-wiu1-1-region-patcher-brick-blocker.html )

I hope I could help you:)

Though I need someone for my prob ; my multiplayer crash when I join a TDM or FFA game..

Help plx"

,dirtypitch,2010-11-17T21:36Z,"Having the same problem as staffordshirebull, I load in the disc, the Wii shows the game in the window. 

Press the window to load the game it goes onto the first main call of duty start page with the music, when you select start it just goes black screen and crashes, even the Wii remote turns off at this point.

Anyone have ideas what is causing this???? 
Cheers"

,TheColonel19,2010-11-26T00:44Z,Works great using wiiflow and cfg loader thanks uploader
,crystally,2010-12-05T00:20Z,"works fine with wiiflow and if you update your cios to  CIOS 249 [57 Base] Rev 20 then in the wiiflow you go to the settings and changes the cios to the 249 57 20 :).

before i had som trouble to play, it froze in the loading scene but now it works fine."
,macca747,2010-12-11T15:10Z,What program should I be using to burn this torrent? I have used DVD Fit - the standard DVD burner on my xp laptop but the Wii is not reading the disc.
,SupDotCom,2010-12-13T13:18Z,is it safe to update the multiplayer component of this or not?
,seanhiggy,2010-12-14T03:19Z,"THIS TORRENT IS BEING WATCHED!
Sorry for the caps :P but seriously, i downloaded it, and my ISP sent me an email about this torrent, and that i had to delete it, so obviously i did.
i wont ever download a game again, but can someone tell me how to not get caught downloading movies etc?
also, would my ISP be watching me now? im with TPG (im in Australia)"
,TiTOp64izGonnaKillu,2010-12-15T18:28Z,"@ seanhiggy
I hope you know that your ISP has the power to see every single thing you've browsed and downloaded. The only kinds of things your ISP can't see would be web pages that are protected like the ones that have https. So no this torrent ain't being tracked unless it is by someone else, but for the most part, it's probably not. "
,nickboy98,2010-12-17T00:48Z,"anyone with a softmod having problems make sure your cios 249 is revision 20 or higher or else it won't work.... i would also recommend (if you use neogamma) to update to neogamma r9 beta 47, it reduces lag during the game... for me this game works awesome

burn with imgburn 2x
verbatim dvd-r
waninkoko cios 249 r20
neogamma r9 beta 47
uses neogammachannel forwarder (NGFW.wad)"
,Strongbad,2010-12-29T18:46Z,"ISO file not working. Cant add iso to my external USB HDD with WBFS 3.0. all i get is an error....

Maybe there's a workaround?

If your using the same set-up as me and can't be bothered with a potential workaround then search for a different release because this doesn't work."
,shadowfigher,2010-12-30T01:38Z,"when I choose the game in wiiflow before entering the game, it not pass the loading have any solution?"
,tajnost,2011-01-04T13:29Z,by defaut it loadin game with IOS 249. and then it dont get past de loadin screen.. try loading it with IOS 224 ;-)
,jamstobin,2011-01-05T02:17Z,"1. wiibrickblocker on downloaded iso
2. install 249 Base 57 rev 19 cios
3. use usb loader gx and set it to 249
4. Run, Update and play black ops!!
worked for me"
,dousanchez,2011-01-07T06:21Z,The best way of loading is using uLoad 5.1D or + with cIOS 224 v5.1 (base57) installed. I recomend use Pimp My Wii to do it.
,curlymgee,2011-01-11T22:38Z,"Thankyou, I had a lot of problems getting it to load until I updated to cios 249 r20. Not sure what I was doing but it works now. Thanks again!!!"

You should encrypt your uTorrent traffic(In options, force encryption). Your ISP can still see the activity and who you are connected to but they cannot read the data being transmitted because it is encrypted.

,stonerz101,2011-10-22T18:06Z,@seanhiggy Like you said some torrnets are watched :P ... Torrents are legal so they cant just send u a message about downloading a torrent... Torrent is just another way of downloading stuff. They might also see what your browsing and have software that tells them when you are download Malicious things on your computer. I suggest you get an IP Hider for uTorrent.
,Airazz,2011-10-24T18:05Z,"Doesn't work, gets stuck on the initial ""Loading..."" screen. Wii hacked using ModMii, all other games work fine. Anyone knows any possible solution?"
,joegill97,2011-10-28T03:31Z,"I've been downloading for 20hrs now and im still only at 51%, i would recommend downloading the one in the wii top 100 and changing it to pal (if you need it) with Regionfrii and wii brick blocker :"
,goldengamer411,2012-01-04T10:38Z,"if you use usb loader
you in your ISO settings up to 250 instead of 248"
,axemblack,2012-01-18T14:27Z,"ISO works perfectly.

For anyone having trouble, follow this guide to softmod your wii properly!!
http://www.wiihacks.com/recommended-faqs-guides-tutorials-only/96886-guide-softmod-any-wii.html

Then transfer the ISO onto your external hard drive as WBFS using WiiBackupManager software and it should work perfectly. Thanks uploader!"
