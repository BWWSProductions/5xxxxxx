,spunkedunken,2011-03-19T21:33Z,Russian language
,c0ldsteal,2011-03-24T02:28Z,There is an english audio track too--read the info!
,prince__vlad,2011-11-25T19:32Z,First thx for upload! Second I have a question: is there a way to preserve russian and english audio track or at least the english one when converting this file format to..MP4 ? I tried with 4videosoft MKV video converter but...the single audio track that the converter keeps it in the new file is the russian one ! I hate that... Can anyone help me with a suggestion please ?
,mt_phile,2011-12-15T21:33Z,"prince__vlad, Google mkvmerge

That will let you strip-out the RUS soundtrack leaving the ENG, then hit it with your 4videosoft or other converter."

,numse,2012-03-28T22:56Z,shit has hardcoded ruski subski
,Sunuvagun,2012-04-20T06:15Z,"@ numse: nope, they're not hardcoded, just embedded.  Turn 'em off in VLC, or, like mt_phile says, strip the subtitles and the Russian audio using mkvmerge.

@ GoodFilms: Thanks!"
