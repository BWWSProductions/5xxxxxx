[quote][color=deepskyblue]It's impossible to over-emphasise the impact Little Richard and the music on his first two albums for Specialty Records from March 1957 and July 1958 had on the future sound of R&B, rock and soul. â€œHere's Little Richardâ€ and â€œLittle Richard Volume 2â€ have just about every classic Little Richard side on them. This is the music that influenced and paved the way for the hundreds of beat groups of the 60's, and coupled with the larger-than-life anarchic, excessive and erratic personality of Little Richard himself, is the bedrock spirit of everything that followed in rockâ€™nâ€™roll, its sound, its image and its energy
