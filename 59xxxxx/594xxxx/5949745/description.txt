Originally released in November of 1972, the Edgar Winter Groupâ€™s double platinum record They Only Come Out at Night broke new ground with Winterâ€™s legendary synthesizer sound and became one of rockâ€™s classic records of all time, containing two of rock â€˜nâ€™ rollâ€™s most notable anthems, the free-spirited â€œFree Rideâ€ and the ultimate jam tune â€œFrankensteinâ€. Produced by Rick Derringer with Ronnie Montrose on guitars and engineered by Bill Szymezyk who later produced Hotel California and other Eagle hits, They Only Come Out at Night didnâ€™t gain immediate commercial success. Winter and the band thought the song â€œFree Rideâ€ was the most commercially feasible tune and after a disappointing brief appearance on the charts the band started talking about their next project. 
Meanwhile, a grass roots phenomenon was spreading across the country. Underground college FM stations all across the US discovered a b-side tune called â€œFrankensteinâ€. Winter and his band mates basically had a great time jamming on â€œFrankensteinâ€ but never considered the over 4 minute tune to be commercially viable. â€œFrankensteinâ€ was soon one of the most frequently requested songs on mainstream AM stations and astonishingly climbed to #1 on the charts! The album reached the #3 position and the re-released â€œFree Rideâ€ reached #14.
