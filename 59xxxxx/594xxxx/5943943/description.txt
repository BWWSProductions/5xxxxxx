The Vapors - Waiting for the Weekend [promo].VOB 



HQ very rare promo music video. "Waiting for the Weekend" is a song from New Clear Days, The Vapors 1980 debut album containing the UK hit singles: "Turning Japanese", which reached No. 3 in the chart in February 1980. A remix of "News at Ten" (named after the well known ITV news programme), went to No. 45 in July of that year. A third single, a re-recording of "Waiting for the Weekend" which included a horn section, failed to chart. 

Apart from the three singles, the best known other track is "Sixty Second Interval". Its ambiguous lyrics have been interpreted alternately as concerning the short cease-fires agreed between armies during wars to allow each to attend to their wounded in the no-man's land between them. The song was the inspiration behind the long running "Sixty Second Interview" feature of the UK's Metro (Associated Metro Limited) free newspaper given away at public transport stations.
