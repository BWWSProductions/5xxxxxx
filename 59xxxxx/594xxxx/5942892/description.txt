I\'m uploading this for the people who use a nme chip in there xbox like me. But cant find the program to auto edit the .iso files

The use is simple
1 : Extract the file (obviously)
2 : Start the program.. well duhu :p
3 : Go to the convert tab (nr2)
4 : Select yr iso file there and press convert.
grats y just got an iso that works on a nme chiped xbox360


Im recomending Verbalin dvd\'s, burnt with ImgBurn. and if a .dvd misses so look got the abgx360
Never had anny problems with anny game wile using these programs.

enjoy the burning :)
