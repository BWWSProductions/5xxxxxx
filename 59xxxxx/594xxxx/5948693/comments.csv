,jorce,2011-04-01T17:29Z,"I'm not 100% sure but I think the Easter Egg is the fact that you can type whatever you want in the Generated from field to create very customized keys.

Also, thank you ChattChitto!"
,xchaser1031,2011-05-14T23:58Z,This is the one and only kegen i have found that works on all the games. I love this keygen!
,WEBLEYYYY,2011-05-20T17:58Z,The easter egg is in one of the Tiger Woods games serials. See if you can find it :P

,CVezery,2011-05-20T23:58Z,@'alphasoul7' you add the key either when you install the game or when it asks you for the key

,crz4all,2011-06-08T18:56Z,"sorry to come here just to ask you this, is that I always downloaded the EA Games Generic Keygen and noticed that you have updated your most powerful keygen, let me know if you want to update it or will abandon him?"

,Caliber1,2011-07-05T23:13Z,"This is an awesome Keygen, nontheless. But Could you make a Crysis 2 Keygen for Origins? (New EA Installer)"
,us01,2011-09-15T14:46Z,"It says you can have future and past EA games serialized using this tool. Yet the maker of the keygen keeps releasing new versions with new games added? Whats the point?

And why only EA? You work for EA?"

,Sublime865,2012-01-11T18:09Z,"Here's my problem, I need a key for Mass Effect 1 - Bringing Down The Sky. It only generates for games on the list or games in the CD drive, I need it to generate for an EXE based DLC installer... It has Pinnacle Station, why no BDTS?!?"
,sonofsam0981,2012-01-17T21:01Z,"OK...Maybe im just a dump fucking NOOB, but cna any of these register on Origin? If no, do you have anything that can either register on origin or ea.activate? 
Thanks!"
