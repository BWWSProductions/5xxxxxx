	KATIA AND MARIELLE LABEQUE

Katia and Marielle were born on the southwest coast of France near the Spanish border. The two sisters are a sharply contrasted, yet highly communicative piano team. Their repertoire includes a broad range of material, from Bach on period instruments to the 21st century contemporary composers.

The sisters received initial instruction from their Italian mother, Ada Cecchi (former student of Marguerite Long), who began lessons when her daughters were three and five years of age. Upon graduation in their mid-teens, the two undertook performance of contemporary music. While a certain notoriety came with this performance repertoire, truearrived when their two-piano recording of GershwinÃ‚Â´s Rhapsody in Blue sold over a half million copies.

They enjoy collaborations with many of the worldÃ‚Â´s leading conductors, among them Semyon Bychkov, Gustavo Dudamel, Charlie Dutoit, Sir John Eliot Gardiner, Zubin Mehta, Antonio Pappano, Georges PrÃƒÂªtre, Sir Simon Rattle, Esa Pekka Salonen, Leonard Slatkin ,Michael Tilson Thomas and Robin Ticciati. They have performed with the worldÃ‚Â´s most prestigious orchestras: Amsterdam Concertgebouw, Berlin Philharmonic, Boston Symphony, Chicago Symphony, Cleveland Orchestra, Leipzig Gewandhaus, London Symphony, the Philharmonia, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Filarmonica della Scala, Philadelphia Orchestra, Bayerischer Rundfunk, Dresden Staatskapelle and Vienna Philharmonie.
