I DIDNT THINK A PSP WOULD READ A SRT FILE."
,omegastoo,2010-11-11T21:24Z,"sorry ignore the caps, wasn't looking at screen when typing, not shouting, just need help. how can i get the navi srt to run a psp doesn't seem to recognise the file??"
[T],on.off.on,2010-11-11T23:37Z,the srt files are meant for vlc or media player classic. the embedded navi subs are for ipod touch/iphone. Sorry cant help you with the PSP problem mate. i dont own a psp just knows it plays on it :)
[T],on.off.on,2010-11-11T23:39Z,last time i did any hardcoded subs i got screamed at.. so i didnt do it here sorry
,omegastoo,2010-11-12T08:39Z,"Ok thanks anyway ok, just be aware then that this shouldnt really have psp in the compatability list as you cant tell what the navi are saying lol. I'll run it thru a psp video converter and try to hard code them in."

,jrocsexy2000,2010-12-25T18:28Z,Downloaded this but how do the embedded navi subs work. nothing pops up when I play it. Is there something I have to do?
,MadTogger,2011-01-04T18:21Z,"I found that subs were not working for me on my iPod Touch so I found a tutorial here:-

http://blog.philgin.com/?p=14

I first used mp4muxer to remove the sbtl on t3, then followed the tut step by step.

I renamed the m4v file to Avatar.m4v & the NAVI subs to Avatar.srt.

The only step that didn't seem to work was:-

Editing your Movieâ€™s Subtitle Track:

when I searched for 'text' it was not found but I did notice that 'sbtl' was already in the file, I guess this is because it is already a m4v file and not an mp4 file.

Anyway, subtitles are now working fine.

Thanks for the upload."
