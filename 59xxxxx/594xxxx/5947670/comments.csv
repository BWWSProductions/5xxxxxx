,Final_Justice,2010-11-11T00:12Z,"Yeah same question....the pic doesnt matter as it was god before...none of this matters if the audio sucks! It was very bad on all of the other ones,"
,Final_Justice,2010-11-11T00:58Z,I can confirm picture looks great AUDIO IS VERY BAD (The same audio as the others the tin can sounding audio)
,Shoobox,2010-11-11T01:00Z,"audio sounds good to me, but i really don't think this is scecretmyth, didn't they switch over to hdlite name"
,Shoobox,2010-11-11T01:01Z,"audio sounds good to me, 
but when did secretmyth come back, after superfundo callapse i thought they changed over to hdlite, if im not mistaken"
,The OutLaw Torn,2010-11-11T12:30Z,"Let me first say that they were very slick with how they cut the sample. They used a singing scene, which is very hard to discern how the actual sound quality is because there is a lot of background noise going on, plus music. You can't REALLY tell if the sound is better with the sample they included. I downloaded a couple rars separately and listened to them. When I did THAT, I was able to watch a scene where there was nothing but talking, and that's when you can tell that the audio is CRAP. Very bassless and tinny sounding in nature. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS VERSION. WAIT FOR ONE WITH BETTER SOUND."
,sxp64,2010-11-11T18:18Z,"I'm amazed by how dumb the R5 rippers are, I mean, sure, it's a hasty job, and some are glad it gets done either way, but just a little more attention and knowledge about audio wouldn't do much harm in the R5 rippers world. It's just so bad, on average, it looks like they're being ripped by monkeys. How hard can it really be to copy audio from one medium to the other?"
,afgaviria,2010-11-11T22:00Z,im just glad that your back man! thanks a lot.
