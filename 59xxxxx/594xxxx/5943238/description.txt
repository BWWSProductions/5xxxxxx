If you are planning on studying to take the CompTIA Security+ exam, this is the materials you need. If you are like me, you learn better from visual examples instead of memorization of stuff you read. These videos will take along time to cover, as most are 30-45 mins long, but you will pass with flying colors if you take this material seriously. Don't spend tons on boot camp training, this is what boot camps train you with!


(This is exactly what I used to get certified with, I maybe googled 2 things to clear up a few logic idea's I had but other than that, this will cover EVERYTHING)
