,darkpat,2010-11-11T06:26Z,"Hi Globe :-)
I`ve allready downloaded the skidrow Version but the game crashes for me in the first 5 Minutes of gameplay.
I`ll try now youre upload. Do you use the skidrow crack or did you cracked it on your own?
When i install the game, i installed the vcredist, but it only asks me if i want to repair or uninstall, so i did both, and installed the vcred from the microsoft site again. Maybe i did something wrong there, i dont know.

I had ""unrecovered directx error, or the game just freezes. I tried to turn off sync but then game crashes.

I hope i got better luck with youre version of the game.
Ahja and when i play the first 5 minutes the game lags horrible, but playable (if you got good nerves) :-)

OK, any Ideas what to do, or maybe i just dl your version and see what happens.
I guess that skidrow version needs some patches or fixes, seems to be good protected.

OK, greetz to Porto!

Crackfix from reloaded? 

You dodn't need no crack because the game is already cracked, the only thing you need to do to run the game is:


1 - download and instal the Freearc software: [url]http://www.freearc.org/Download.aspx[/url]



2- open the program and extract the arc file to the desktop

3 - open the extracted game folder and run the Globe Converter.exe


4 - start the game with BlackOps.exe

5 - play the game


NOTE :  MULTIPLAYER AND ZOMBIES WILL NOT WORK "

I am far beyond that, I installed 3 Versions of the game,Skidrow,Ripper and Globes, I know how to install Globes releases and got Free arc as my standart zip Proggi on my PC.
The thing is that I got Probs with EVERY Version, game crushes during the first 5 minutes, Direct9 anyithing error ""ran out of mem"" I guess my PC did not got the minimum spec. to run the game because of my cpu. Its an QAthlon 2 x250 dual with 3 ghz.
I will try to overclock that peace of shit now and then well see what will happen.

Globe is great in compressing games but i think he uses the cracks around from skid or reloaded, I think hes not a cracker but a legend in compressing games.
I thought the crackfix can make the game working but it dont, .
Even if the game allready is cracked you can apply the crackfix, cause the exe is the crack.
Also the crackfix got an update in it, but that dont work for me.

IDEFIX i gues you are German cause Idefix is the Name of the dog in Asterix but only here in Germany, but maybe...I dont know but thats the dogs german name, so if u r german talk gerrman weil ich nÃ¤mlich auch einer bin :-)"

Your Athlon x2 250 processor is good enough to play this game, what graphic card do you have? did you install the latest driver for your graphic card? have you update your directx? http://www.microsoft.com/games/en-us/aboutgfw/pages/directx.aspx ..you will need at list 2gb memory to run the game ..4gb is perfect.

The minimum specs for the game, is (CPU) Phenom X3 8750. I only got Athlon dual core (not a triple core) but i read that if you got an athlon x260 (this one is clocked to 3.2 ghz should be enough. I try to clock up my cpu and then we see if that game works or not.
All drivers and directx is updated but i still get this ran out of mem error.

I've done the steps to extract and convert the game to the letter, however I'm getting an error saying ""This application has failed to start because d3dx9_43.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem."" I've used Globe's other torrents before and this is the first time I've encountered a problem, so I figure that I may have done something wrong. Thanks Globe!:) Seeding..."

,pearldrummer84,2011-03-23T19:57Z,Useless.  Use a real archiving program like 7zip or WinRAR.  ARC is garbage.

Then once i actually got the game working there was no sound, the game worked fine just no sound, so if you dont mind it being quiet while you play then this is the game for you"
,thelacha,2011-07-11T01:02Z,"Try PeaZip to extract, personally use it. It is better & faster then any other extractor for 100% sure.
