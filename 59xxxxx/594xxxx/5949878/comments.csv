,User897,2010-11-12T06:39Z,Fast download my ass.  PLEASE SEED!
,smknjoker,2010-11-16T02:36Z,Any chance of a DVD rip? My media player can't read bluray files : (
,KevMovieMan,2010-11-16T17:18Z,"Wow. Dling now and I can't wait, very excited I am I am... I tip my hat to you sir! I've found this same torrent on other sites with more written comments and nothing but PRAISE & THANKS for an outstanding copy. Thanks again"
,KevMovieMan,2010-11-16T20:11Z,"BTW Guys this is infact what the title says, even starts with the Alternate opening. THANKS AGAIN SANTi!!!!!!"
,spiritualiste,2010-11-16T21:39Z,"Thanks a lot for this high quality share...
Live Long and Prosper...

,The3vilM0nk3y,2010-11-17T06:48Z,any comments on quality?? A/V??
,referhead,2010-11-17T09:41Z,"@smknjoker

wtf u mean ur media wont play bluray files?!?! its a FUCKING AVI the same as most dvd rips. wow

anyway, is there anychance of a dvd rip anywhere? i jus want a smaller file! thanks!"
,aradiel,2010-11-17T12:12Z,"DVD rips and BD/BR rips are just the source of the original material. There's no reason why a BD rip can't be 700MB.

While 3GB is a lot, this is a pretty long movie too. If you take into account a lot of 90 minute movies are 1.4GB then this 170 minute one at double the size is similar quality to those."
,KevMovieMan,2010-11-17T14:59Z,"@Referhead

U wont be finding this copy in a smaller size. Then again? Why would you want to? The movie is nearly 3 hrs long and gives the best results with a high resolution which means big file size.

Also don't hate on the noob recommend a better media player or something.

Audio/Video is great by the way 10/10 DL this with no worries! "
,bychance,2010-11-18T00:27Z,"Thank you R.H., Santi and seeders. KMPlayer (Google it), is a free download and plays this movie, subtitles and all. Stunning."
,halofubar,2010-11-18T04:50Z,"if ya have VLC there's almost never a problem playing downloaded movies; even loads up faster and freezes less often than windows media player and divx player (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/)

thanks for the up, raymondhome"
,syrrik,2010-11-18T06:32Z,"Can anyone confirm which extended cut this is? There was the 8 minuets longer one released in 2009, and there was the 18 minuets longer one released on the Collectors Edition set a few days ago.
The torrent name says 2009, but the running length looks like the 18 min longer version.

Anyone know which it really is?"
,weaping_reaper,2010-11-18T07:18Z,"Sorry Ray, this is a good rip, but I've seen DVD rips of better quality.

[T],jerry7_57,2010-11-20T19:06Z,Thank You!!!
,Mrbaggins1956,2010-11-20T21:06Z,"OK, I tried DLing KMPlayer and that won't play it either. Is this actually a bogus file or am I missing something?"
,TacoGrande,2010-11-21T08:00Z,"When I burn this movie (and others, especially MAX  torrents) to Divx or DVD, it will not play the ending. What's the Deal??? Help a brother out, thx."

,Mrbaggins1956,2010-11-22T01:12Z,"How are you guys getting this to play? VLC doesn't work, KMPlayer doesn't work. What am I missing?"
,MoviesR101,2010-11-22T02:43Z,"Thanks For The Up!
@smknjoker and  Mrbaggins1956 - Media Player Classic Will Play This Movie!

@referhead - Slim chance of getting a smaller size file, this move is almost 3 hours long? A smaller size file will lower the quaility of the film! Maybe think about getting a bigger internal or external hard drive? Good Luck!"
,jackson5more,2010-11-22T12:58Z,I cant believe these parts were taken out of the movie. Better quality than an average DVD rip. Thanks y'all!
,EraserFace,2010-11-24T03:26Z,"@Mrbaggins1956
dude u tryin to play the subs!! as a movie. open the other file and it should play(should end in.avi) If u want to add the subs in then you need to Video>substrack>then add the file."
,cooloolaman,2010-11-24T10:54Z,THANX FOR THE UP MATE
,Kristo-,2010-11-24T14:34Z,Are you sure this is extended? The title doesn't make it clear.
,afgaviria,2010-11-26T00:11Z,"-try k lite codec pack (it contains windows media player classis) to watch it

-to burn it in a dvd try converxtodvd, great soft to burn movies to a dvd

- the audio is 5.1 so you need 6 speakers to enjoy the quality at full.

-and yes is the extended cut with 16 min extra.
thanks all."

,Mrbaggins1956,2010-11-29T22:00Z,"It's official, I give up. I dl'ed Media Player Classic and it won't play the AVI file either. I'm 0 for 3 on players with this file. I'll just hope somebody uploads a divx file."
,c3bhm,2010-11-29T23:44Z,Get the .mp4 Kingdom release.  Actual 720p quality at THE SAME FILESIZE AS THIS ONE.
,c3bhm,2010-11-29T23:50Z,Get the .mp4 Kingdom release of this new extended version. It's truly 720p but only 3 gigs.  This one is only 400p - HALF the quality of the Kingdom release.
,Vimes84,2010-12-02T13:30Z,"@Mrbaggins1956

Revove every codec you have - audio and video. Then install ffdshow. It's the best possible codec for EVERY movie."
,The_Digital_Pirate,2010-12-03T09:12Z,This Looks Like A Great Video Game...Not A Great Film...Such A Waste...
,keepitlive,2010-12-04T00:58Z,"Amazing that with 1890 seeders, it still takes me 6 hours on a 50/50Mbit line to dl it, YIKES, still to many hit and runs out there who doesnt know how to open ports for faster sharing :O)

Ended dl, as its probably cheaper in voltage to just buy the BR edition hehe

Have fun all you leechers :)

This is a 400P not 720P. 720p is horizontal resolution. Your one is 400P."

,unknown87iq,2010-12-15T07:46Z,"Just wanting to warn ya guys,

it is a good rip, but not 2.87 GB good

I mean for a size like that, it should be ass-kicking rip, but unfortunately it is not...
its not worth downloading, plus; speedof download is slow, I have dl speed of 300-400 kb/sec and this download at about 20kb/sec!!!!"
,Krealot,2010-12-21T02:27Z,"freshfighter9: read the description again. It says subs (whole movie). 

Thanks for a good upload!"

,FreeTibet,2010-12-24T11:53Z,I checked out both FLAWL3SS and SANTi's 480p BRRips. I think I'm going to stick with this one. Thanks a lot for the upload and merry Christmas everyone!

,dYhA85s,2011-03-07T02:41Z,thanks but why hardcode the non-English subs when these could as well have been put in a separate file?
,Softy_John,2011-05-15T20:51Z,"There's english subtitles on constantly, is there any way to turn these off?"
,bragazar1710,2011-07-16T05:31Z,thanks.
