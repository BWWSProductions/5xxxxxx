,dramacydal77,2011-03-02T01:24Z,"DON'T DOWNLOAD. The file plays audio but no video, file is in a very bizarre format called .mkv

Don't waste your time with this one"

Google is your friend, don't take your computer-illiteracy out on the innocents. Matroska (.MKV) is a commonly used format for movie rips. Use VLC media player, works best, generally speaking, with support for a wider variety of formats.

Next time, do a quick search before you make claims."

This must be the first time ever watching an extended cut for this movie and I must ask - Is it normal for the credits to roll after every story? And since the stories are done like that it technically makes the entire movie chronologically false because things happen at the wrong time and nothing really lines up."
,PHAIIANX,2011-08-07T05:05Z,"video is great, 720p. audio is absolutely terrible. 60 kbps, that's half of the worst quality available in itunes. What the fuck were you thinking?"
,pestilence2k,2011-10-29T00:26Z,"Video is great, audio is bad quality.  64 kbps...?  I'm searching another torrent"
,widgetsdaddy,2012-01-20T05:32Z,"THIS RIP IS A MESS. THE STORIES ARE IN THE WRONG ORDER & THE FINAL CREDITS ROLL 3 TIMES DURING THE FILM. SHAME, COS THE QUALITY'S GREAT"
