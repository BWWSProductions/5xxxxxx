ReleaseNotes:

Deja Voodoo is an album by the southern rock jam band Gov't Mule. It was the first Gov't Mule
album to feature Andy Hess and Danny Louis as permanent members, and it was also the first
album that Gov't Mule did not play live before its release. The title is a reference to the
fact that the band believes it rocks just like it used to before the death of former bassist
Allen Woody.

Beginning in late 2005, the album was released to include the Mo' Voodoo EP.

Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,
HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality
of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
