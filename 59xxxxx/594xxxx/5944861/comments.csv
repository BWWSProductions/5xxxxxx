[V],ChattChitto,2010-11-11T15:17Z,"@promodsharma Same here but I must tell you to stop leaving misleading comments.
This is the first release that was passed into two testing team. I have tested my self and two others have done so!
Just after you spammed by your comments (5) I had retested it and result came positive! The release is WORKING FLAWLESSLY.
Nothing more I can say or will say."

The initial testing and my testing was Based on Windows XP PRO SP3.
So there's no way it wouldn't work on it.
It's a problem at your end :)"
