20 years after the cult classic TETSUO: THE IRON MAN, director Shinya Tsukamoto makes the third entry in his landmark series with THE BULLET MAN. A fresh take on the battle between man, machine and nature, this hard-hitting sci-fi thriller depicts a grieving American businessman in a Shakespearean showdown against the mad scientist that transformed him into a metallic killing machine. Being Tsukamoto's first English-language film, not much of THE BULLET MAN may make sense, but no viewer will be left unscathed after experiencing his particular brand of metal chaos.
