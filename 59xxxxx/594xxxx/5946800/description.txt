Most recordings by flutist James Newton are quite spontaneous in their improvising, but well-planned as a whole. This outing features Newton with three string players (violinists John Blake and Gayle Dixon and cellist Abdul Wadud) and a four-piece rhythm section (vibraphonist Jay Hoggard, pianist Kenny Kirkland, bassist Cecil McBee and drummer Billy Hart). Each of the five numbers has its purpose, including \"Mr. Dolphy\" (a tribute to Eric Dolphy), Wayne Shorter\'s moody \"Anna Maria,\" and a three-part suite about South Africa (\"Diamonds Are for Freedom\"). Well worth several listens. (AMG)
