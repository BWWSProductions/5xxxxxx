A DVDR torrent typically contains the complete VIDEO_TS folder folder from the DVD, decrypted and shrunk to no more than 4.35 GB, so that it can be burned to a single layer DVDR disk.

Here, as a sample, is a user who is very good at creating proper DVDRreleases: http://thepiratebay.org/user/djfred500/


When you create a posting for a movie title, it is always good to provide the release year in the posting title, and also to add the IMDb link to the posted info.

I may upload the full DVD9 images in the future, uploading +/- 16 gb as my fist torrent seemed a little overkill.

As for the DVD9 to DVD5, It seems a waste to me. But you can get the DVD5 images on Demonoid if you want."
