Plot Summary:

The starship Enterprise takes on new adventures in animated form in this colorful cartoon from the 1970s featuring the voices of the original "Star Trek" cast (except that of Walter Koenig, aka Chekov). In this collection of episodes, Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) and Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) find an artifact that could start a holy war; the crew members start to shrink; and alien females hypnotize the men on board.

(1973-1975) The cast of the original Star Trek -- William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, James Doohan, and Majel Barrett -- reunite to voice the animated adventures of the Starship Enterprise in the Saturday morning revival of the classic sci-fi show. Original writers D.C. Fontana and David Gerrold contributed scripts, as well as former cast member Walter Koenig, and Gene Roddenberry is executive producer.
