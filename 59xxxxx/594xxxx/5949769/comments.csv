I had the other version before and I've deleted absolutely any file I could find and reinstalled and played again, and when I went to the second floor and tried to get the key from the painting (or whatever I've to do there), I concluded that this shit doesn't work! Omg, I really want to play the game ..."

thanks  "
,ghostmill,2010-11-24T13:11Z,Same materializing key problem here. ANY IDEAS HOW TO FIX IT????
,HellsGayngel,2010-11-25T02:43Z,"Found out the problem. The Materialization issue is caused by a progression bug that was included in the beta version of the game. This is the Beta (pre-release) version that was shared. So someone has to upload the latest release of this game in order for it to work.

Apparently downloading it from Big Fish Games or Frogwares resolves the issue."
,MerseaParadise,2011-03-14T15:12Z,"USELESS TORRENT! WON'T WORK BEYOND LEVEL 2 (materialisation)

DO NO DOWNLOAD
