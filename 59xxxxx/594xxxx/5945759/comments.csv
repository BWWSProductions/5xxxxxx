,GenEmperor,2010-11-11T18:57Z,If you say Works or doesn't work you need to say what mod your wii has too and what region your wii is as well. It is pretty much useless to say works or doesn't work because everyone has different mods on their wii so what works for you may not work for another and vice-versa. 
,GenEmperor,2010-11-11T19:00Z,If it works or not also state what mod you have and what you tried along with your wii region either PAL or NTSC. If this info is not given then your comment is useless.

DISC FIX

Ok Disc Users using the USA/NTSC i uploaded heres a Disc Fix for you all which i use rather than neogamma loaders n shit. So it wont wont freeze i have a PAL console and it loads first time .

download this and place in your Apps folder on your SD.

SoftChip R102 http://filetrip.net/f10162-SoftChip-R102.html

go into homebrew channel and boot Softchip loader up.

instead of using the standard setting insert these settings

Change ios used to 36. with the + button

Games Language to English.
Patch Country String - Enabled
Set Video Mode Using - Force Wii Region
Fake ios version - Enabled
Sam n Max - Enabled

And the last 3 are Disabled

You should now be able to play the game from disc without it freezing"
,GenEmperor,2010-11-12T03:48Z,Use the SoftChip R102 download in the previous comment and it works on a NTSC wii. Both neogamma and Wii key 2 failed but so far the softchip download works 100%. 
,GenEmperor,2010-11-12T04:33Z,I just copied and pasted that info on the Disk fix in the previous comment but I was not the one that uploaded this game just to clarify.

and installed from wad manager in homebrew channel and it now works fine in neogamma"
,jlim637,2010-11-13T01:47Z,"I'm currently seeding, just finish downloading it today, took less than 24 hours to download lol.

Anyways, sorry for this newbie question: After I download, do I extract all the files and burn them on a disk? Or what do I do? Someone mind giving me step by step please?

And thank you for uploading it .BONE."
,jlim637,2010-11-13T01:48Z,"Sorry for this double post.

Also, do we have to get SoftModded on our Wii in order to play burned games?"
,blfc,2010-11-13T09:56Z,"Yes jlim637, you need a softmodded wii or a wii with a modchip. Google for pimp my wii if your isnt softmodded."
,GenEmperor,2010-11-13T10:16Z,@jlim637 after you open the files you downloaded you will see a whole bunch of rar files. Open the first on the list or keep opening till you find an iso image in one of them. Then right click on the iso image and click burn with IMGBURN. If you don't have IMGBURN then you need to google that and download that software. After you click burn with IMGBURN insert a DVD-R disk and burn at the slowest supported speed for your burner. The supported speed is shown by imgburn. Note that the supported speed is NOT the slowest speed you can choose. That is it at least for the burning the game. To softmod look up videos for this on you tube. note that this may vary depending on the update you have done to wii. Avoid updating as this will make it harder to mod the wii.
,skullos,2010-11-13T11:41Z,"@jlim637 This is one hard game to start hacking with you know. You should first get your wii softmodded. The best site with the best explanation for this is wiihacks. You should go to recommended faqs and guides and then softmod your wii according to your firmware (Do not update to 4.3, otherwise you will have to buy or rent a game to get your wii softmodded) I recommend using an HDD. After the softmod you should install the newest version of ios 249 with base 57 and load it with ios 249. You'll probably won't understand the last thing I've written but the most important thing is to get your wii softmodded."

@dirtyone31: for info on how to get the update to work go to wiihacks dot com and search: ""black ops guide""

1. Prepare an empty SD Card
2. Create 2 folder in the SD Card:

> wad

[WadManager]
3. You need to download a software call WadManager. Just search for Wadmanager17
4. The Wadmanager you downloaded shall be in zip file. Unzip it into a folder. What's inside shall be wadmanager.dol. You have to rename it to boot.dol.

,hiidoran,2011-05-22T19:28Z,"@Remo5000
yes, you can use the classic controller pro with it. Any game that uses the classic controller is also compatible with the classic controller pro. Hope this helps, and happy fragging!"
,tehmagiic,2011-06-07T20:07Z,does this work on dolphin the emulator?
,vinnylima,2011-06-22T04:11Z,"Works perfectly on my 4.1U Wii with Wiikey 2 (running normally through Disc Channel).
But, I wouldn't recommend to run this game through disc, as many people have reported their consoles were damaged even after playing original copies of CoD Black Ops. That's because of the graphics which force the Wii to its maximum."
,AshArmy,2011-07-13T20:06Z,"Works great burnt to disc 4x, Uloader and make sure in the settings Uloader is set to boot it with IOS224 or whatever the last option on the right is. Works great, and yes you can download the update for online, it won't hurt you."
,batmn39,2011-07-30T00:22Z,@kelvinyam ~ You ROCK!!!  I followed your instructions to a tee and worked absolutely perfectly!!  That is awesome and appreciate your help tremendously!!  Glad there are people out there like yourself!!
,alzho,2011-08-10T21:05Z,"It won't load, tried with Neogamma beta 47, Neogamma beta 50, WiiFlow 1.1, Config. USB Loader, USB Loader GX. None work, help

I have cIOS250 (and homebrew of course)"
,xlos_crudos4x,2011-08-16T04:14Z,Hey! thanks. this worked! Wasn't a big hassle like I thought it would be. I have Configurable USB loader. all I had to do was change iso249 to iso250 and it worked. Thanks! I'm just not sure if it's safe to download the updates online..anyone know? i'd like to try out the multiplayer. 
,Bynx,2011-08-19T21:30Z,Im an old guy with a Mac. I opened the file and burned the ISO file with Disk Utility at 4X speed. When loaded into a hard wire modded Wii there is nothing past the logo screen. Ive read 3 or 4 page of complaints and fixes. Anything simple here? Not soft modded. 
,Jeronwong,2011-09-07T06:47Z,"I opened up the folder containing Black Ops, and all I got was a bunch of rar archives. What do I do with these? It says to extract to full iso, meaning? I have a softmodded wii with usbloader gx and a 500 gb hard drive."
,Jeronwong,2011-09-07T06:59Z,"nvm, just extract all of them to a single folder, gives you a beautiful iso yay."
,smoshfan1,2011-09-08T00:23Z,lol everyone complaining about the game freezing at random points get over it the official disc does this its not the torrent
,smoshfan1,2011-09-08T06:30Z,"@xlos_crudos4x

,TheDutch888,2011-09-12T14:42Z,"hi,
does anyone know any torrent for CoD: World @ War which works on the wasabi DX modchip? Because if i try to run the game the screen goes black and i have to turn off the wii. Please send me an link to an compatible torrent for this game."
,Necroplex,2011-10-06T16:50Z,HOW TO EXTRACT and can i put them in usb so that i can load with usb loader ??

It works for me on my 4.3E with USB Loader GX no IOS change needed."
,joshman196,2012-04-05T23:46Z,"Is it just me, or is the multiplayer server not loading? It starts to load by showing the new version but then it keeps saying please wait next to nintendo wi-fi connection..."
,joshman196,2012-04-06T00:24Z,"Never mind, I just got it working. If you guys want to get it working, make a second profile on the multiplayer menu. then try to go online with the second account, it should prompt you with the update (DOWNLOAD IT). After downloading, exit back and log into your original profile, it should work now. I don't know why its like this, some really annoying glitch that took me an hour to find a solution for."
,AacidusX,2012-07-04T03:59Z,"To those having issues with Softmods and what not. I highly recommend the guide by Mauifrog, to override your existing one.

http://www.wiihacks.com/recommended-faqs-guides-tutorials-only/96886-guide-softmod-any-wii.html

That said, you can just change the IOS by displaying the CoD's game channel, then Game Settings, the open the Loader configuration.
Search for IOS, click on it and clear whatever is on the screen and replace it with 250, if that doesn't work, change it to 249.
This will only make the change for that game.

As for those loading a game from disc, if your Wii was made after summer of 2009, you are SOL."
,AacidusX,2012-07-04T04:00Z,^^^ to previous comment. This is using USB Lloader GX.
