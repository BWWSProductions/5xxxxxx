Winner of 10 Best Documentary Awards, "Living With Pride: Ruth Ellis @ 100" is a one hour documentary about the life and times of Ruth Ellis. 

Born July 23, 1899, in Springfield, Illinois, she was thought to be the oldest "out" African American lesbian known. In addition to exploring her rich past, the film offers a rare opportunity to experience a century of our history as lived by one inspiring woman. By example, Ruth Ellis shows us what is possible and what can be realized, if one not only lives long and ages well but also lives with pride.
