,djv1979,2011-04-29T00:14Z,Get an audio converter program. Not that hard and fun to know how to switch up formats whenevs!

,frostyfreeze,2012-01-28T05:53Z,"of course, there's ""that guy"" here with the same old crying over free sh*t biz-nezz (coupled with an amazing degree of ignorance)  this so-called ""lame-ass"" format is completely lossless audio, compressed !! - and djv1979 says it best, it is sooo easy to find converters that work in like 10 seconds - i mean, if you can work a torrent client, i'm willing to bet you can work a google ;-)  many thanks for this dude, i love this guy and i'm off to buy his ""Alabama Chicken"" cd on Amazon as i type this crap - seed it up peepz !!"
