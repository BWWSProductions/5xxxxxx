Imperial Armour 8 (VIII) --- Raid on Kastorel-Novem

Medium\Good Quality.

From authors: 
Waaagh! Garaghak is gathering pace across the Forsarr sector. Several of the ImperiumÃ‚Â¹s worlds have already fallen to the rising green tide of Orks, and now the sectorÃ‚Â¹s primary hive world has been invaded. GaraghakÃ‚Â¹s hordes seem unstoppable, except that the Raven GuardÃ‚Â¹s Scouts have discovered a secret behind the Goff WarlordÃ‚Â¹s unending warbands Ã‚Â­ - an Ork technical genius called Mek Boss Buzzgob who has created his own factories on the former Imperial refinery world in the Kastorel system.

This book contains a detailed history of the Raid on Kastorel-Novem and the rise of Warlord Garaghak. There is a complete Elysian Drop Troop Imperial Guard army list, including the Vulture gunship, Valkyrie Sky Talon and the Tauros and Tauros Venator rapid assault vehicles. There is also background information on the Raven Guard Space Marine Chapter, along with a new special character, Shadow Captain Korvydae. Rules, background and technical details are included for all of the recent Forge World Ork releases.

This book is heavily illustrated with over 50 colour pictures, 60 full colour vehicle profiles, over 30 technical drawings, plus colour profiles for the Elysian Drop Troops, Raven Guard and the Orks of the Goff, Evil Sunz and Death Skullz clans, all to add new depth and detail to the Warhammer 40,000 universe.
