,Kadedrab,2010-11-10T16:22Z,"Ok, since keys get blacklisted for too many ppl using it...should some of these links be disconnected after so many ppl download...it would prevent a lot of blacklisting and users (like me) don't have to keep jumping from key to key...Just wondering if that would work! BTW>>>thanks for the download!"
