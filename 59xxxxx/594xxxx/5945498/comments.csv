,Rambo1909,2010-11-12T02:31Z,"Thanks for the quick reply. For the rest of you who had the same problem, heres the reply from Wi-Foo-er:

yes of course it, BT or winblows won't open it (as no one has 13 GB of ram) 

you can ether do the command; cat super-wpa and this will not load the file but rather just flick trough to show you its contents. like the ""type"" command in winblows

or if you must ""look"" at it then you must split it into more manageable peaces. 

for this do the command (BT)


split --bytes=1000m wordlist.txt wordlist_part

the ""wordlist.txt"" is the imput file and the ""wordlist_part"" would be the output and the 1000m is the size of the split (1GB) so you would have 13 x 1 GB files. 

or you could just not worry about it and dump it into pyrit.  (around 30 min read time)

p.s  Thanks for the download. Hope it helps.  (by the way with Internet Explorer or firefox i couldn't post any comments. i think the site being stupid)

Thanks for taking the time to share such a comprehensive wordlist. When using this in BT and splitting it into 13 x 1GB files to crack a WPA key should Aircrack-ng be run individually for each 'wordlist_part'? So it could take to the 12th 'wordlist_part' before there's a key match? If you could clarify that then it'd really appreciated, thanks alot pal!"

Well thats the thing with cracking WPA, 80% is luck and 20% is skill. So the answer to your question is.. I dont know !  it may take upto the 12th part or it may not, it depends on how the user has choisen his/her password. 

If is not a default ISP set WPA then thers a good chance of crackig it. On the other hand if its a ISP set WPA (8-12 RANDOM) then its unlikly you will be able to crack it."

,Scopse,2011-04-06T23:26Z,"Wi-Foo-Er....

been running the super-WPA for the past few days, split it into 1GB chunks and been running it through Aircrack after I de-authed the client and forced a handshake, just a question for you if you know, will Aircrack constantly loop through a dictionary untill you quit it? I get to about 16,000,000 keys tested and I quit it to start the next dictionary. I'm assuming if I never intervened then Aircrack would stay trying to crack the password with the same dictionary on loop until you quit it? If so then I think I'm doing the right thing and I'm on my 5th x 1GB chunk of the super-WPA wordlist with no success yet.

Thanks again for uploading this."

If you just let aircrack go it will chug along until it gets to the end of the dic file.  When it gets to the end without finding the passphrase in the dic file, you will see the message ""Passphrase not in dictionary"".  So just let it fly and keep checking in on it periodically. "

Okay, cheers pal. I was running aircrack with say the first part of a dictionary and I was getting to about 22,000,000 keys tested and I thought it was just looping around the dictionary so I was cancelling and going on to the second part of the dictionary, what you're saying is that aircrack will notify me with a 'passphrase not in dictionary' when it's tested all of the keys in the first part of the dictionary so I know to move to the second part?

,ksteuber,2011-10-06T06:34Z,"A few interesting things about this wordlist:

It is true that aircrack can only handle files up to 2 GB (If you are getting the ""Empty List"" error, this is most likely your problem). You can divide it up with the split command: 
split -b 1610612736 -d Super-WPA wordlist
(1610612736 bytes = 1.5 GB)

Although it is quite a sizable list, there are a large number of duplicates. I ran the file through sort -u to sort it and remove duplicates, and the resulting file was only 7.2 GB which means that almost half of the words were duplicates.

Additionally, since aircrack displays the passwords as it tries them, I noticed that there is a *VERY* long section of passwords that are strictly numeric and increase by 1 at a time. I guess maybe this was an effort on someone's part to pad their list and make it look bigger. I calculated that there is approximately a gigabyte of lines that are entirely numeric."
,Wi-Foo-er,2011-10-12T19:22Z,"ksteuber =  sort -u it NOT reliable in backtrack as its RAM dependent meaning that the sort command loads the file into memory and if you don't have the RAM to suit then BT will dump the rest, so that don't mean you have so many duplicates. !!  And it's there is a gig of numeric entries this is to cover house phone numbers,  mobile/Cell numbers, date of births and so on .. it's called being ""flexible""  you fucking noob  as you NEVER know what he or she has chosen for the passphrase     
"
,fakevrn,2011-11-16T08:40Z,"uniq only compares consecutive lines, so unless the word list is pre-sorted it will not remove all duplicates.

sort -u is not limited by the amount of memory, it writes multiple temp files to disk so it can handle large files. 

Thank you for putting the list together but its not flawless, running sort -u will reduce the size of the file significantly. I would also suggest leaving the phone number list as a separate file"

According to the pyrit reference manual:

[quote]
[b]import_unique_passwords[/b]: 
...This command does not check if there are duplicating passwords within the file or between the file and the database; it should be used with caution to prevent the database from getting poisoned with duplicated passwords. This command however can be much faster than import_passwords

So, this command is contradictory to is name. It does NOT check for unique passwords.

Just use: import_passwords

,agn0genic,2012-03-28T21:40Z,"This list is ridiculously huge. With 10 machines in my pyrit cluster it still takes several days to crunch the entire list.That said I've had 100% success but if the password is towards the end of the list you are going to have to wait for it. I pity the user using a single machine with this list.

That said if you have an Nvidia card, make sure you setup pyrit with cuda for a 10-20x performance gain. Also test to see if the AP is susceptible to reaver. http://code.google.com/p/reaver-wps/  I have had reaver crack an AP in 2-3 hours that takes a day or so to use pyrit."
,Banksno925,2012-04-10T04:18Z,"Thanks Great Upload. I used the Custom list and worked no problem in BT5. But the Super list wont fully mount as it says I only have 5 GB of free space. How do I go about splitting the file in 2 or 3 parts ?  I am using the BT5 disc to boot on my PC.

Thanks for your time and download. Best wordlist I have so far."
,stepking2,2012-05-30T19:49Z,"I just want to inform you that Aircrack-ng takes the Super-WPA wordlist without a hickup.

Also, thank you so much Wi-Foo-er for these wordlists, and especially by making them into 2 bigger files, than 30 smaller files!

Will definatly download more wordlists from you ;-)"
,Tinta-Roriz,2012-06-03T17:36Z,"Nice list (and big too :))

Wi-Foo-er, can you tell me if your list has keys such as:

AE05C328F0E40B240AC00F6AEB

This is the default key of my router NetGear.
It seems that these NetGear routers have a 26 letters/numbers password (by default)!

I appreciate your comment and again a big thanks for your effort.

Cheers "

Netgear are usually WEP codes. I believe that password of yours is a WEP password :o Like the one I use at home. You dont really need a wordlist for that .-.

Thx for the upload btw :o fml....Im only using 1 machine... this is gonna take a while x.x"
