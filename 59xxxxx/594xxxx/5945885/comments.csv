,JessterKing654,2010-11-10T05:01Z,"Why the fuck do you split it up into little chunks?  This isn't a newsgroup, torrents have built in hash checks, and if there are links in there, no one looks at them, they just delete them."
,pengouin007,2010-11-10T14:05Z,"I think so too, same. One piece One file."
,5iTH,2010-11-10T19:08Z,"Lol. Complaining instead of thanking. You might be stupid but there's no need to compound your stupidity with ignorance. Have you considered that this same set of files might be being uploaded to a number of different types of fileshare? Have you considered that, despite (as you point out) there being no need to split the file in a torrent, there are a greater number of fileshare protocols that have improved functionality by way of a split file? Obviously not.

It's not bad enough that uploaders get little thanks for giving us their bandwidth until, at least, the torrent is off the ground but then you open your stupid, fucking ungrateful, arsehole of a gob and spout shit all over their hard work.

Go fucking fuck yourself you fucking shit sniffer.



Cheers for the upload! Much appreciated :D"
