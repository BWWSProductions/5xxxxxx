This is the correct Part Two file of ESPN3's complete coverage of the 2010 World Series of Poker Main Event Final Table.  In my original upload the Part Two file was the same as Part One, just ripped at a lower bitrate.  This is the final 3 hours and 40 minutes of play from ESPN3's broadcast.  The broadcast was split into two parts because of daylight savings time in the US (this is mentioned late in the commentary on the Part One file).  There are no holecards provided because it was a live broadcast.  On this file the table is played down to the final two players.

This file was ripped at a slightly lower bitrate of 800kbps.  Sorry.  The broadcast is still in English.  Enjoy!
