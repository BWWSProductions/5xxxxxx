,creams31,2010-11-11T00:09Z,"i'm sorry, but where is the first part of day 1?"
,DTTNWO,2010-11-11T00:56Z,"Not entirely sure what's going on here but there is another file from jkitty not listed with the other WSOP 2010 - All very confusing I'm afraid if you read the comments on the below file. I think Day 1 Part 1 is in the file listed though.

I deleted it after 10 mins."
