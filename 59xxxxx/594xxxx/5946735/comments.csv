Answer:

The app only works for jailbroken iPhone, iPad, and iTouch with Installous already installed into the iDevice. Installous is an app that allow you to install cracked apps onto your iDevice. It also allows you to sync cracked apps with iTunes. You can find Installous in Cydia by adding:

cydia.hackulo.us repo

Under: Manage / Sources / Edit / Add

answer:

every  time you upgrade your iDevice firmware, you need to rejailbreak. every time you rejailbreak, you need to upgrade Installous. Make sure that Installous is upgraded to it's latest version. then iTunes should sync with your cracked apps just fine."

,Maalic.,2010-12-02T13:41Z,"yeah it works fine on iphone 4,,, IOS 4.1 and ISO 4.2."
,ghost232323,2011-01-12T19:21Z,"Basic info you guys might need. Sure, installous is good, but get appsync from cydia and try it through iTunes first. I personally haven't downloaded this myself, but appsync usually works.

If you need help in regards to jailbreaking iDevices, email me on ghost23@live.co.za"
