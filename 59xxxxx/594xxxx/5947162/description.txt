Hi there..


This movie is the true story of missionaries that gets into a really bad situation.

I have uploaded this before, but on that upload the VHS-rip had Norwegian subtitles 150 pixels up on the bottom of the screen, and I thought that might be a bit disturbing to have there for people from outside of Scandinavia, so I cropped the picture to get rid of them, and this is the result.

But back to the missionaries. In this bad situation, there was little hope of any human intervention or help at all, so things looked quite bad.
There were glimpses of hope shining now and then, but nothing substantial, humanly speaking.
Then something happened that changed the whole situation..


I can not give away more than that, I can only add that the story is told by the missionaries themselves, and that it's a great movie that many have reacted upon with a renewed hope and a rekindled faith in their hearts as result.

May it be of joy and help to many.

In Jesus' Name,

V.
