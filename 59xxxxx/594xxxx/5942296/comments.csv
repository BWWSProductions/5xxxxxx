ha"
,ogchris,2010-12-24T18:39Z,Thank you.  Spin the Black Circle!
[T],rjordan21,2011-01-29T16:20Z,"insinuendo, this sounds great but....

Do you hear the occasional pop?  Not from the vinyl.  Listen to track #5 ""Black"" at ~4:19, ~4:38 and ~5:00.

I heard it using the latest Winamp and Foobar.  I hope my soundcard isn't going to crap!

Thanks."
[T],insinuendo,2011-01-29T16:47Z,"Yes rjordan21, 

there are some background pops, though I couldn't confirm for certain the source, but it's definitely not (only) your soundcard :)

BTW, I'm really enjoying the Possibilities and Face Value ups!"
[T],rjordan21,2011-01-29T17:31Z,^^^^ Thanks.... glad you're enjoying the music.

,geenotreally,2011-05-09T15:09Z,Thank YOU for uploading in FLAC
,DragonF.C.Porto,2011-09-05T03:27Z,thanks
,pgans,2011-09-28T03:06Z,Thanks a lot. Exactly what I was looking for!
,_kewlCat,2011-12-01T16:02Z,"tu insinuendo, top quality. PS: 2 little pops never hurt anyone. In the 70's we would wear the vinyl grooves thin before we had to repurchase the LP. By then, we heard 40 pops per side & still loved the jams. Same here."
