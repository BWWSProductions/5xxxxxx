the files are legit, this is the game Gray Matter.

However, just last month it was delayed until 2011 because it wasnt polished enough.

Is this the expected release version or an unfinished version of the game?"
,mufuti9,2010-11-11T04:41Z,"I am sorry, please disregard my last post. The game is released earlier in some parts of the world I just read. so this is probably the finished version.

thanks :)"
