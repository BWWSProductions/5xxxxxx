Gracias."

Nonetheless, thanks for the effort."

,Tolzar,2012-01-03T22:41Z,"THANKS A LOT for all your torrents,
Is there any chance you can upload Toy Story 1 with spanish audio and/or subs? Latin audio ideally but any one will do.
Any other kids movies you may have with spanish options as well, i.e. Kung fu panda, ice age, the incredibles, etc.

thanks anyway, i love your torrents and always seed them"
