The Left - Gas Mask (2010)

Original Release Date: Oct. 26th, 2010


One of the best Hip-Hop albums of the year, no debate. Do not sleep on this instant classic. I saw that there was not a torrent available for this album, and I had to up it for all the real heads. If you love that Nas, Jay Electronica, Blu, etc.... you will LOVE this album.
