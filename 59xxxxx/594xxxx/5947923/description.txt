PC Gamer. December 2010.

PC Gamer launched back in 1993. It was an incredible time for the PC; games like Doom, Ultima VII, and Syndicate were showing the power and flexibility of an open gaming platform. PC Gamer's rise reflected that. The magazine rapidly became the global authority on PC games. With the best writers, the most extraordinary scoops and fair, honest reviews. We've sold millions of copies all over the world, and we've been online in one form or another for over a decade.

Enjoy.
