,redvanilla,2010-11-10T09:36Z,"@thetorrentlord: Which numbers are you talking about?
The number of downloads twentyfortys encodings have compared to the number of downloads your torrents have?
Or the numbers of quality +1 votes his uploads have compared to the ones your uploads have?
Or the numbers of times you were told to read before trying to think for yourself?
Do you actually know what you are talking about or are you just jealous and unable to accept other peoples achievements?"

[V],twentyforty,2010-11-10T10:08Z,"@thetorrentlord: So - it was 100 MB smaller then any other rip of that Preair, right?

Beside, look into TV packs - ONE mp4 Preir was posted on same day - 245 MB.

Then - AIRED ep.1 is 480p - you idiot. It's BIGGER in frame size by ANY XviD - by ~33% and still is MORE THAN HALF in size of ""official"" XviD. BETTER by any measure: file-size, video, sound - you name it.

Get your numbers straight, you moron. Mentally ill people should at least try to back-up their lunacy - but I guess, you can't do that..."
,kzrockz,2010-11-10T10:11Z,i m nt able to get enough seeds or dwnload speed frm ur tv pack frm abut last 1 week.wat is wrng.is their ne thng wrng frm my side?i use bittorrent 7.1.plz help.gr8 upload by d way.
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-10T10:18Z,"@ks85: In every long Header (Description) of my uploads. You can click on ""twentyforty"" then on few my torrents."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-10T10:47Z,"@kzrockz: As first and most important - you should check in ""Peers"" Tab  are you connected to my seeding server (usually only BitTornado with 100%). I have 3 Gbps upload speed, currently.

2nd: You should wait at least 20 minutes and watch there have you (your BitTorrent) received something from my server. It looks as long time to monitor, but you should be aware that I could send packets to 32 at time, and you must wait to be served.

If you cannot connect to my server, you might have wrong settings (usually wrong Encryption or too low  TCP port), my IP is blocked by your firewall or by your PeerBlock, or - your provider blocked my address or range of. 

Also, bear in mind, that torrent client programs behaving badly in cases of so called ""partial downloads"" - for example, one choose just How I met your mother from 1.24 GB pack and by that gets lowest priority from ones who have 100% - also, your EXCHANGE with fellow peers determines your so called ""inner swarm rating"" and if one has low upload to others - usually get nothing from others 'cause their programs mark these as ""uncooperative"" and selfish swarm members."
,punk67,2010-11-10T12:43Z,Hi mate excuse my ignorance but is conan in you tv packs conan obrian or conan the barbarian mini series/remake?thanks twentyforty for all youve done and do!

thanks in advance!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-10T14:47Z,"@skillet: I've done first two episodes... and literary - for no one. Both torrents stood here for couple of hours - and no living soul picked any of them! I wasted not just a time for obtaining sources (few GB each) but time and energy in encoding. Not to mention that both times precious upload slot was occupied and other things have been delayed.

Some shows cannot find audience here - and other uploaders (as we all see) are more than happy in offering their flawless encoding skills  to the people - with ""small"" caveat - downloaders must pay for burned additional Gigabytes, one way or another."
,punk67,2010-11-10T15:49Z,Thanks twentyforty for the clarification regarding conan
,skillet92,2010-11-10T16:28Z,"no problems !!
thanks for the reply!
and have u seen the mail i sent on your email id?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-10T17:36Z,"@skillet92: Yeah, I got it.

1. Regarding rest of the Avengers - I replied on that already. Season has three more episodes and I have no clue could I obtain high quality sources for them. And - as you have seen - without any doubt - my encodes are best out there and it would be stupid to do remaining three if such quality cannot  be retained. So, we will see.

2. Regarding Last Airbender: Already asked. Fits into:
""REQUESTS ARE 'FROZEN'""

3. Regarding Transformers: Already asked. Answered. I have done both. Re-doing comes not into question in months to come.

So - three questions on which I have answered during past week. Do not make me feel like parrot, please. You are regular here - read my answers, please, please..."
,skillet92,2010-11-10T17:51Z,"Sorry i actually check the latest torrents for your answers & may have not checked the before pages for the replies!
