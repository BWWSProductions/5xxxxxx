,DeanMachine16,2010-11-07T22:50Z,"This episode aired last Tuesday night.
Canada's Space channel is airing all of the final 5 episodes as originally scheduled.
Only SyFy decided to drop it till next year."

,the_one60,2010-11-12T05:55Z,Worst video quality EVER
,kkbb3000,2010-11-12T13:30Z,"The one 60 is a fucking liar, the quality is great and thanks for the upload, after the story started in 2009 I just wanna see the fucking end and move on."
,the_one60,2010-11-13T19:49Z,"While 8 bit color depth looks good on an ipod or other tiny screens, on a big screen there is pixel blocks in dark areas, no detail in the shadows or back ground, and color banding. Set your monitor to 256 colors and you'll see.

Thanks to wilimaw for the upload..not your fault about the quality.

kkbb3000 you're a moron."
,TheTrekhippy,2010-11-14T00:48Z,"Thank you so much to Yoox, Wilimaw, TPB and all you unthanked Seeders!"
,]eep,2010-11-18T04:08Z,"I really hate those companies that have no respect for their viewers. Why did they cancel the best show ever halfway the first season? After an idiotic summerbreak that kills any chance that ppl can get used to airingdates. 

And then they 're suprised that this is the way ppl share it. 

Thanks for sharing. Now i can finally continue."
