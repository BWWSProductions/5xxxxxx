This Dassault Mirage F1 has a good quality, it is actuality for FS9 but you can run it in FSX.
The originally panel didnÂ´t work so i put another panel in it and it works great, i put the setup Gmax F1v2.5 for those who can figure out to have the originally panel.

To install:

Just open the Dassault Mirage F1 file and copy the 2 files named gmaxF1 and gmaxf1c and put it in airplanes folder
and the effects files into effects folder in FSX file.
