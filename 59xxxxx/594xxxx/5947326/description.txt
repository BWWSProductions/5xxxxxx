"No Ordinary Visitors"

When Stephanie's hard-to-please parents, Barbara 
(Cybill Shepherd) and Allan Crane, pay an 
unexpected visit, the Powells must curb the use of 
their powers for fear of giving away their secret. 
But Barbara and Allan begin to suspect that 
something's awry when they witness some strange 
behavior. Meanwhile, when friend Trent Stafford 
(Jackson Rathbone, the "Twilight" movies) and his 
parents are the victims of a home invasion, Daphne 
uses her abilities to help Jim try to track down 
the thugs responsible for the violent act.

Enjoy :)
