,grrrnola,2011-01-01T01:30Z,Radio voice-over at the beginning. Sound is mildly distorted. There's a 256 kbps version floating around that sounds just like this; I don't know if this is an original 320 kbps bitrate file. Maybe better off downloading the single song off the full album. I think I'll have to resort to finding the FLAC version and converting it. Thanks anyway.

I wonder if grrrnola thinks the introduction of ""This is international, big, mega, radio radio smasher!"" is the radio voice-over, lol.  That's actually a part of the song, and as already mentioned, the quality is perfect.  Thanks!"
