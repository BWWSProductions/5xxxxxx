I know, the timinig to present a christmas record could be much better, but this is mainly to complete the little *Elvis on Speakers Corner Series*. Beside that it is also great record from the sonical and musical point of view...


The sound is intimate, delicate and pure. Its a spectacularly well-textured monophonic recording that offers great depth and a natural presentation.
The package reproduces the full sized, full color booklet featuring some spectacular shots of the young Elvis in all his youthful glory. Whatever the source and whoever cut it, this reissue sounds superb. What a fantastic Christmas present from Speakers Corner! Thank you!
