,HelloDolly1,2010-11-11T16:07Z,Argh!!!! It's the british narrator. He's so annoying. But MythBusters still rocks.
,PhiberOptix,2010-11-11T19:44Z,At least he speaks English...
,diartesacus,2010-11-12T04:39Z,British narrator! Interresting. Not the usual hamburger voice. :)
,graeme431,2010-11-14T18:10Z,It must be australian narrator cause he said kilometers instead of miles
,ballebula123,2010-11-14T20:28Z,"No he doesn't have to be australian to use kilometers, juist that he isn't retarded... that's all... :)"
,ravenlord_79,2010-11-20T19:33Z,"Narrator uses international mesure units, progress! Can americanÂ´s learn new tricks? Kilometers, not miles, kilos, not pounds ;)"
,Bl4bber,2011-09-01T00:21Z,"Those arn't too bad, but gallons, and cubic inches, and the accompanying odd conversion rates (231 cubic inches per US gallon o.O), urhg!"
