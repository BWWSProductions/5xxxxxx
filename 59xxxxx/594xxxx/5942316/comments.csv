[V],prashant22,2010-11-08T17:59Z,"ok guys i'll do it...i was going to it anyway because of the casting in the movie...
i know it is good bt i really dont like horror type movies thats why after reading ur comments i said no...

@sreeja
ya i'll do it as it is a new movie..i think most of u guys would also like to give it a watch...
"
,jarman007,2010-11-08T18:02Z,"i have vlc player 
and it has option to play anyone

i think other players will have it too... i think"
[V],prashant22,2010-11-08T18:16Z,"@mkz
u have an option to turn one off and listen to the other at one time.."
,DSIN,2010-11-08T19:07Z,"@prashant : dude... se7en is not horror..its more of a thriller with gr8 performances..7 a gr8 ending that makes u think ...
u don't need to do it... i actually have a 8 gig 1080p version of se7en...
:D

@mzk : u named all the classics... & dark knight, shawshank redemption r my fav's ... batman begins was not that good IMO.. i always watched it as a buildup to dark knight...
ok..so my #1 is...(drum rolls)... FIGHT CLUB :D
my other top 10 include... The prestige, black hawk down, good will hunting, dark knight inception, memento...etc... 
& i liked Godfather..probably my under 20 movie (man i hav to make a full top 50 list now) LOL
:D"
,akindayimcan,2010-11-09T00:45Z,"guys it is not necessary to talk about Se7en.
Only word is perfect movie..."
,ThaGoatMan,2010-11-09T06:06Z,"@all

Watch Happiness (1998).It may not be disturbing in the true sense of the word but will disgust you.

Here are some more stomach churning movies (warning: They are truly disturbing and fucked up and are not recommended for the average viewer)


1.Salo (1975)
2.Audition (1999)
3.Cannibal Holocaust (1980)
4.I Spit On Your Grave (1978)

Se7en might seem like a cartoon if u watched these movies."
,DSIN,2010-11-09T11:01Z,"@mzk : i told u iam not a fan of any actor at all... its just a coincidence that both ma #1 & #2 r brad pitt movies... & it all comes down to taste...
u don't like godfather too... which is one of the gr8est movies of all time..
troy --------> LOL nuthin special abt it... 
anyways... if i hav to rate actors... i'd just stick with the likes of al pacino, tom hanks, morgan freeman, de niro, spacey, samuel jackson etc...
compared to them..todays actor look noobs... (yes iam including depp, pitt, cruise, caprio etc here) excluding few gems like norton & carrey..
@goatman : u forgot Exorcist (my fav horror & 1 of the most disturbing movies ever)..
btw se7en (as i said earlier) wasn't abt being disturbing...it sends a msg ... & it cannot be compared to the fked up movies u named ..(i've seen cannibal holocoust & i don't recommend it to anyone...) 

p.s : i just lov typing LOL... :D"
,DSIN,2010-11-09T13:01Z,"@mzk : i typed etcetera didn't i :D 
btw those u named r just good looking & not ""phenomenal by any stretch of imagination"".. reeves can't act for his life.. expressionless most of times..
pitt is the icon among them ... so is depp...
cruise is ...okay 
bale --------> can be gr8 sometimes (machinist, american psycho & prestige) & can act terribly bad(T4 salvation, reign of fire..) otherwise avg..like batman.. he's in same league as jackman & smith for me.. (good actors league) LOL
damon & caprio .. good not gr8... :D
but then again thats ma opinion & i literally grew up watchin hollywood..  
i missed many, thats y that ""etcetera""... tommy lee jones, cage, connery, crowe, ...man there r so many gr8 ones... :D

@prashant : print is gr8 dude... :D A/v-10/10 :D"
[V],prashant22,2010-11-09T13:28Z,"@DSIN
well something for me to cheer abt in ur long comments..;-P
