,DarkerSkies,2010-11-25T03:27Z,"The Video TS folder will not burn there`s a problem with the IFO`s and NAV Pack if you try to burn it as ""DVD Video File"" you`ll receive a DVD-Video files reallocation error! relating to the IFO`S

Rebuild the movie using DVD Rebuilder pro (or similar) after which the resulting ""Video TS"" folder should be fine and burn minus the reallocation error.      "
,DarkerSkies,2010-12-12T21:47Z,"kremenisch you need to burn the Video TS Folder onto a blank DVD disc not a cd.As there`s not enough space available to fit all the data onto a cd.
The size of the file should have made that fairly obvious, this isn`t a DVD Rip it`s a retail DVD"
