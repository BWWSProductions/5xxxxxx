This DVD is the first one hour special released by Greg 
Giraldo. Greg is one of the hottest comics in the USA. 
Socially provocative and yet broadly funny, Greg has 
become one of the most versatile and highly entertaining 
comics working today. Greg is one of the premiere comics 
consistently featured on Comedy central and has become one 
of the faces of the network. Along with appearing on Last 
Laugh on numerous occassions and hosting Friday Night Stand 
Up for the network he is most known for being the top roaster 
on the Comedy Central Roasts.
