I'm running windows 7 64bit, I played the game for a little bit and clicked ""save and quit"".  I exited out of the program, loaded it back up and chose ""campaign"" and clicked ""resume campaign"" and it worked perfectly.  If you don't see ""resume campaign"" the first time go back to main menu then back into ""campaign"".

You don't search for a saved file in the game, you only click ""resume campaign""

didn't mean to come off sound harsh, I thought you might of been bashing this file to ruin the reputation.

I hope this game will be much better than Medal of Honor, which sux.

Will it be possible to play online on private servers like in COD4:MW?"
,Andy-Camel,2010-11-10T19:40Z,"
The release works well and it's a great torrent.

BUT there is something really wrong with the game, I have pretty good hardware and all, but the game is simple unplayable.
MW2 worked perfectly, and players all over the forums are begging for solutions for those glitches and lag. I tried all the solutions, but nothing is working.

Seems like the game was designed for super-computers."
,Pastor7,2010-11-10T19:43Z,"im uploading 300 kb/s and downloading 50kb/s 
WTF?!"
,DakotaDC3,2010-11-10T19:45Z,"I'm going to give some answers, so people can stop asking the same questions all over again.

1- The torrent works (Single player only)
2- You CANT play multiplayer
3- You CANT play LAN
4- You CANT play Zombie mode
5- Game has a problem that needs to be patched ASAP and makes it lag and stutter like crazy, even on the high-end systems.
6-Game SAVES OK. Just press resume mission to return to where you were.

This means we urgently need a patch from Treyarch to fix the lag and a lanfixed crack so we can play zombie mode.

LAST: STOP BITCHING AND PLAY WITH WHAT YOU HAVE NOW!"

the PC version being full of bugs causing stuttering and lag. I've experienced this myself with a  single GTX480 , with a Duo core 6600 @ 3gs.  The word is the game comes with multi. core CPU's turned off and multi. GFX cards turned on, so this might be the reason why people that have 2 GFX. cards not experiencing any lag or stutter.   Its really weird because the game graphics are not really that great.  "

,Xiggy,2010-11-11T00:16Z,"For those of you having problems with resuming a saved game, this is what worked for me. 
1) Start Black Ops
2) Alt+Tab out to your Desktop
3) Navigate to your Black Ops install folder
4) Go to Player\Save\(most recent save)
5) Right click and select Open With
6) Choose Browse then navigate to your install folder and choose the BlackOps.exe
7) Bring back up your game and choose campaign
8) You should now see Resume Campaign

,jduncanator,2010-11-11T06:44Z,This game lags alot when played via steam also! At least there is a fix for it when you play via steam. I had the same problems so I started steam in offline mode and once the game has started Ctrl+Alt+Del and end the 'Steam.exe' process! Works like a charm for me! I don't know about the rest!

If no multi-player crack/hack is released soon I will go out and buy the game. I am holding out because of the disappointment in the last 2 releases (WaW, MW2). These video game creators put out so much love for their console gamers because their is about %15 more money in the console games because they can charge more but what they don't realize is that consoles will come and go until they all die. The true gamers, as well as the rest of the world, will always be on a PC.

,wierd-old-guy,2010-11-11T15:41Z,"Ravaz: you asked: 
""would my computer run this game
ATI HD2600
amd sempron 2.10ghz
RAM 2.5gb""

Obviously I did not program this game. But this is the deep later half (the end) of 2010 and the standard on the desktop for a PC is 8Gb DDR3 RAM a quad processor and generally a 1/2 Gb of dedicated video RAM.
The above is what is very commonly sold and written for - That's entry level gaming hardware.

You ask yourself: if you have 1/4 the RAM a 
4 yr old video card & a very mild CRU what would you imagine?
I think that the game MAY light up. To actually PLAY the game?????? I REALLY doubt it.

There are some people who really DO beta test the lowest level off functionality of games and apps. If your PC is actually setup for 64bit (w/ a little a factory sticker, etc) and a dual-core at 3Ghz3Gb of DDR2 faster RAM (like at least 533), the program may actually function. but you are REALLY on the low edge. 
Personally I think it would be an interesting experiment; primarily becasue if the game program were stable it would simply run slow as molasses in Winter-time. but if the game were demanding - it MAY be to make up for sub-routines that are better written in later releases.
Try it.....You certainly won't HURT anything."

,coolsmth,2010-11-11T20:03Z,"Completely impossible to play. Too much lag, even with everything  on low.

How true,  there must be something wrong with the game.

Even people such as myself with a GTX480 OCed
cant stop the stutter and lag, particularly in the cut scenes.

There must be a patch by TEYARK or ACTIVISION
to address this problem.

The poor SODS who paid $60.00 for this must really be pissed off.

Yes I'll verify that does help a little but not much.

What is being said about this game is that it is very much CPU bound , so unless you have a high speed Quad core your going to get stutter and lag.

I've finished the game now, but being all the problems with the demands placed on your hardware, it wasn't really a pleasant experience.

Youre comment is not visible for me now, but I remember something like, you put the crack into Steam ???
Wrong Place, totaly wrong.
Copy the crack and put in in your install.dir, in this case
C:\Programme\Activision\CODBO (call of duty black ops)
Then it will probably work, not for me, game crashes in the first 10 minutes (for ME)
Every time you need to copy a crack, you need to put it in install dir, most Cases C:\Prgrams\andsoon"

When I play this game I feel like I went through a time zone and dropped in to 2005...HELLO we are walking into 2011 and not with a Delorian from Back to the Future..... the games should be getting better, especially with COD. Treyarch should be ashamed of themselves, and Activision needs to cancel someone's contract... Why would Treyarch lead us on like this. If I trade in my 2006 Honda accord for the 2010, I expect to have a better car in my 2010 than the 2006, more features, better experience etc. Blackops is completely backwards compared to World at War. I understand it is not to be compared to Modern Wardfare 2, but Treyarch really needs to kiss the butts of Infinity Ward and borrow the Modern Warfare engine again, because it is obvious they cannot not do it on their own. Black Ops should be the biggest dissapointment of the decade for the gaming community. Dont buy this game! save your money! "

Somehow we are supposed to find craked servers to play online? WHo the fuck knows how to do that, and if someone does, they should post it. Too many stupid fucking comments that dont say shit about the file. Download speed is shit but I willl seed at 1.3 mb for a week if someone can list how to get mulitplayer working. If not have fun with 20kb/s

For the noobs if you want better download speeds you need to forward the port. Go to portforwarddotcom to find out how. Also look up vids on youtube about change the advanced settings on utorrent. Dont rely on people to seed files, instead set your system for faster downloads. Stay away from taht bullshit about game engine to slow down the program and increase speed. Yes you will get a faster DL speed but it will take three times as long to complete. 
Anyways, I'm home all weekend just waiting to seed at 1.3-3.0 mb/s..

great point. I agree. STFU about seeding if we feel like seeding we will.

LAg issues are also being addressed in comments. Start the game tab+alt and then go to task manager and set priority as low. 

READ THE COMMENTS PEOPLE BEFORE POSTING THE SAME BULLSHIT QUESTIONS.

Hereâ€™s a yet another workaround you can try. This involves changing priority for COD : BO Process to minimize CPU utilization issues the game seems to be having.

1. Run the game â€“ after you get to the main menu, Open Windows Task Manager by pressing Ctrl + Alt + Del.
2. Locate the Black Ops process. Right click it and set itâ€™s priority to High.

Anyways.. just finished this piece of shit and now im going back to a good FPS. CODMW was better than this. Maps are weak. Weapons sound like shit. AI is weak and unrealistic.

,xgun75,2010-11-14T07:26Z,"Downloaded yesterday- seeding at unlimited now and will do for a week or so. Thanks skidrow, uploader and seeds.

Game is now working FINE on win7 32 bit, c2d E6850 3GHz + 512 mb 8800GT... 1600x900, 4xAA..I'm at level 9 in SP.

Had to work for it though... lots of research,lol.

To summarise- install and crack game as usual (included crack works fine).

Update drivers (makes HUGE difference on nvidia...really!!) and directX (version included in game will not install automatically unless you started setup as admin...anyway, you can run it as admin from image after exiting setup)

Defrag the drive/ folder (this seemed to make a definite difference for me...)

Start game, Alt+Tab or ctrl+alt+del out and set blackops.exe process to high priority/ dual core affinity in taskmgr.

My game has frozen 3-4 times in 9 levels, but I can live with that.

SAVEGAME PROBLEM FIX:-

Turning off 'Voice Chat' in 'Options' enables the ""Resume Game"" in campaign menu (srsly wtf lol??). If it doesn't, turn it back on, then off again. Now you can resume campaign from last checkpoint instead of playing the whole level over again.

All the best, guys.

My system is new, using some of the latest type of tech available for computers at the moment... core i7, 5Gig ddr3 ram, 1GPU graphics card with dx10 support... Game still glitches, and the lag is more like some kind of coding problem, not a cpu, ram, or GPU problem.
So to you people saying upgrade your shitty computers, STFU! My computer probably beats half of yours, and I'm having problems.

This game isn't really all that graphically impressive compared to others out at the moment, and I have not had issues with any of the other latest games (crysis, fc2, COD waw2, STALKER 3, assassin's creed, Supreme commander2). And thats at high level graphics...

Open using wordpad/notepad

You have to set these lines
seta r_multiGpu â€œ1â€
seta r_multithreaded_device â€œ0â€

to
seta r_multiGpu â€œ0â€
seta r_multithreaded_device â€œ1â€

,leezaal40,2010-11-14T17:28Z,dawnfx your problem is in part due to your dual core cpu and your video card not being powerful enough to run this game properly. The game is poorly optimised for pc like crysis was and you would need a quad core cpu running at around 3ghz or more plus at least a GTX260 or better to run this game well enough to play. Having said that the game is very buggy and suffers lag & stuttering as it's so badly coded for the pc hence the update to help resolve lag etc.

,erikieperikie,2010-11-14T20:01Z,"Some answers

1- The torrent works (Single player only)
2- You CAN'T play multiplayer
3- You CAN'T play LAN
4- You CAN'T play Zombie mode (but you can once after the campaign is finished :D!)
5- Game has a problem that needs to be patched ASAP and makes it lag and stutter like crazy, even on the high-end systems. This doesn't happen on my system, but I hear many people crying about it.
6-Game SAVES OK. Just press resume mission to return to where you were. On my game I have to select Campaign, go back and again campaign to see the resume last mission button.

So play and have fun.

And of course: keep seeding at least the same amount that you leeched. Or everybody will keep whining: PLSZSZSSEEEEDD!! Which isn't necessary if everybody seeded his or her amount."

if you quit the game and then started it over, you will not find resume or load game , so you should choose mission select and select the last mission, always quit the game when the mission starts to not lose your progress."

And the issue with not saving game checkpoints I found out that clicking on ""Campaign"" and then hitting the ESC key and clicking back on ""Campaign"" it then shows ""Restore Game""

Hops this helps someone out there.

The first time I launched the game it came with an error window saying D3_DX9_43.DLL missing, but I solved that by installing DirectX 9.0C (as Windows 7 comes with DirectX 11)

And as someone point out, the game is basically much like ""Calll of Duty World at War"", just a different story."

What really pissing me off is if I open the Peers tab in uTorrent I see 30 different connedtions to me, 85 to 90% of these have 100% of the torrent, about 2 or 3 are uploading(seeding) at a rate of 0.1 to 0.3KB/s. Also, open Pieces tab, theres 30 pieces showing, a80%show they from Fast uploaders........................yeah.............whats the story here with this???
I'll let the Torrent finish, but I'm just stating my point here/
.
30 bloody peers with 100% of the torrent and 3 of them upping it at 0.7KB/s between them..........what the fark the other 27 showing for??? Beats my brain that's for sure"

first make you you have installed the neccessary direct x files located in the installation directory.
after that launch the game and go into sound options change the output mode once or twice - apply - then go to which ever you want or should have. if it still doesn't work, which it should becuase that worked for me then install the new update from skidrow.

If You installed, and it is saying your are missing the above file...google the file. Download it and install to Windows/System32.

I have an issue. I don't have sound! I have sound in the cut scene videos but no sound anywhere else. 

BTW, I had to INSTALL steam to get this to work on Windows 7.

,LadyAshura,2010-12-02T09:15Z,"@ztiberiusd:

You extracted the .iso file.

There is NO NEED to extract the inital files. It is already in .iso format when you download it. All you have to do is mount the image in Deamon tools WITHOUT extracting it. 

Or

You can burn your files that you have now onto a cd. "
,LadyAshura,2010-12-02T09:23Z,"@ztiberiusd:

You extracted the .iso.

There are only two files when you download. .iso and the .nfo file. 

What you did was extract the .iso file (those are the files you see now). 

Go back and look for the downloaded folder Call Of Duty Black Ops - SKIDROW. Look for sr-codbo   Redist > DirectX > run DXSETUP. 

If you are missing a .dll file (d3dx9_43.dll) and the DXSETUP doesn't work, just google the file > Download > Install into Windows/System32

That should be everything. Hope it helps.

,ztiberiusd,2010-12-02T09:24Z,Well after I extracted that .rar I deleted it... Is there a way I can mount or use my files now without a cd? Thanks in advance
,LadyAshura,2010-12-02T09:28Z,"If your computer automatically ""opens the cd"" then just select autorun and it should work as well. 

@My previous post...not all of it posted...kinda weird.

I had to install steam to be able to play it. Just play in offline mode.

Anyone got a solution to this issue?"
,LadyAshura,2010-12-03T14:09Z,"@pirator11

I didn't have any issues using the zip-line. You have to HOLD F down to use it.  However, I did see a comment or two about the key bindings. Try holding down the key for a few seconds. 

Other than that, the only thing I would recommend is (if you have an aftermarket) update the keyboard drivers (if any), or perhaps do a fresh reinstall of the game. 

Also, just for giggles, you could always run the DXSETUP. I know it may have nothing to do with it, but whats the worst that will happen?

You can't play multiplayer your smartass, it's only singeplayer. If you want to play multiplayer, buy the game.

And what he means with ""mount or burn it"".

Mount: Use PowerISO or Daemon Tools to do so you can play the game, it fools your pc so it thinks it has the Black Ops CD in the cd/rom and then installs and runs the game.

Burn: Burn the ISO file on to a DVD then put it in your CDrom"

,vuksna,2010-12-15T12:41Z,"work perfectly
thanks"
,Muleo,2010-12-15T17:32Z,"@macr13 

1) Right click on DAEMON tools in you toolbar, select 'Virtual Devices', then Device 0: No media, then 'Mount Image' (this should open a window for you to find the ISO file you have just downloaded

2) Double click on the ISO file you want to mount and that's the mounting process complete.

**This should start the 'autorun' process and allow you to install the game in which case, skip steps 3 & 4. If it doesnt auto run, carry out steps 3 & 4**

3) Open 'My Computer', and you should have a new drive that looks like a DVD rom drive with a game icon next to it (in this case it will be COD Black Ops)

4) Double click that drive and it will begin the install process as if there were a CD/DVD in your drive

5)Once installed, (do not attempt to start the game yet), Go back into 'My Computer' and right click on the drive you selected earlier and choose 'Open' or 'Explore'

6) In the new window that you have opened, you should see a folder called 'SKIDROW' - open that folder

7) Highlight everything in that folder and copy it

8) Go back to 'My Computer' and go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Activision\Call of Duty - Black Ops   (if you're running Windows 32bit, it wont have the (x86) after program files)

9) Paste the previously copied files into this folder and overwrite existing files

10) Now you can either click the 'Blackops.exe' file or use any of the shortcuts that installer provided to launch the game

That should do it. And obviously the Multiplayer doesnt work as with many pirated games so i wouldnt even bother trying. 

Hope that helps. :)"

It says the Version of the file I am trying to run is not compatible with the version of Windows I am running. It says to Check to see if I need 64 or 32 bit.

Does this game run on 64 bit OS?

I know how to crack games and I never have gotten this message before. I am fairly seasoned in TPB but this is just strange.

COD should obviously run in 64 bit and I even tried the compatibility mode for the Setup.exe

I've even tried moving the folder to the desktop and then launching Setup/Auto run.


Help anyone."

I don't bother with Daemon tools, PowerISO, etc., I use 7-zip (or winRAR) to decompress the .ISO file then run the installer. Everything runs the same, and theirs no need to install other software. This assumes you already have a decompressor with .iso support."

Here are 3 pages for the Zombie fix. You just download the file and copy the contents of the .rar to the COD: Black OPs installation folder. You will want to overwrite the existing files. Now that your Zombies is patched, pull up the game and on the main menu page (Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombie, Options, etc) press the space bar a few times until you break out of the chair, and then walk around the left to the computer terminal. Use the computer terminal and enter code 3ARC UNLOCK this will unlock all three zombie maps for you. "

Reasons for playing MW2:

Modern Warfare 2 on AlterIWnet online, it's possible with the pirate downloaded version

Much cooler weapons, perks and maps!!

Combat training is not possible with this version!!

Treyarch sucks!!!!!!!!

Playing Black ops  is like playing a cheap fake of MW2.

Look at the layout!!!! It sucks!

Killstreaks can't lead to higher killstreaks anymore in Black ops!! EPIC fail

You can't even play Zombies with this version
but zombies sucks anyways.

Look at the weapons!! They look like big vibrators. Shove em in your ass, treyarch bitches"

absolutely perfect torrent thanx to AiTB from Germany
for all those who have problems with the D3DX9_43.dll not found error
look here:
http://www.dll-download-system.com/home/d-dlls-not-system-/d3dx9-43.dll/details.html



This is a working version. 
SKIDROW team is legit. and few other teams as well.

But the Zombie mode doesn't work from the main menu. But after you complete the campaign, it works. Meaning, everytime you want to play Zombie mode, you have to complete the last campaign. lol"

Guess all they teach in school these days is how to be fake ass aggravating little spoiled rotten snots!

I think it was somewhere between page 50 or 60 but somewhere around there. By the way thanks for asking for help and not just whining that the game doesn't work. A lot of folks are more than willing to help if asked politely. You may also wan't to reserch (How to install iso games ""PC"" ""MOUNT"") or something similar. Hope this helps!"

I got the game to mount and install just fine, and when I moved the crack over to the main install folder as directed (I did NOT install the C++ and DirectX extras), the game wouldn't run. I just installed Steam to see if this will correct the issue. The exact problem that came up was a window that said CoD: Black Ops didn't shut down correctly the last time it was run, and asked if you wanted to play it in safe mode. I clicked no at first and tried running it again to no avail. Then I clicked yes to the safe mode window and still nothing. Is there something I'm doing wrong here?"
,therosebride517,2011-02-23T18:56Z,Correction to my prior comment and concern: I've noticed that in the torrent file that there is just an NFO file and NOT a whole crack folder. I'm downloading the crack directly from Skidrow to see if that will work... Hopefully it does.

1)	Turn your direct setting to 9.

To do this, you need to manually change the setting. The settings file can be found on your computer at this address:    C:\Users\username\Documents\BFBC2\settings.ini
(open it with notepad)
Find where it says â€˜DxVersion=10 or autoâ€™
Change this to â€˜DxVersion=9â€™
Save the file.
2)	I also changed some in game settings, but I do not know if these are nessesary... however, these are the ones I used to make it work (these are changed in the game settings once you have run the game):

Overall quality: low
Sound system: Small Speakers
Subtitles: Off

Worked for me. 

I found the game not very enjoyable. I figured since my system ran MW2 really well, that maybe this one would run well as well. That was not the case. 

I found lots of config tweaks for it, but nothing seemed to change, turned off glow and specular, yet they still seemed turned on in game.  

It was the config file in the apps data folder, and It had other changes in it that I made ingame, but the changes I made to it directly never seemed to take effect in game.

you need to copy the files from the skidrow folder to the game installation.
after mounting the iso, go into the ""disk"" files. there will be a skidrow folder. copy all taht into the program files>activison>black ops etc and overwrite all. then you are set.
for everyone else who are missing dll files...google taht shit and just download it! jeez, its an activex file that is missing that is simply fixed by downloading the missing files and doing some basic installation"

,lionbums,2011-12-16T22:13Z,"Hello guys. To the people who get the steam error, you guys are loading the game all wrong. First of all, delete everything you installed except for the Black Ops you just downloaded from here. Then, download PowerIso from thepiratebay. Open the Black Ops.iso in the PowerIso program, and mount it to a hard drive. It will automatically make a new hard drive. Now you have all the content you need to install the game. Run the installation from PowerIso and install the game. Don't press ""play"" or else you will have to start all over. Get to the cracker folder in the folder you downloaded (Call.of.Duty.Black.Ops), and copy everything in that cracked folder to C:\Program Files\Activision. Go to the main Black Ops folder and don't go into any subfolders in that Black Ops folder. Copy the cracked content and paste it into the main Black Ops folder that you just installed. Replace if needed. Now, in the cracked folder there should be an icon to play the game. Thats the main thing you have to use. Also copy everything from the cracked folder, like I said before. With that icon to play the game, it should be in the main Black Ops folder that you installed. Use it to play the game. Do not use the original icon that was already there. Good luck! If you want step-by-step instructions email me at nicorivera98@hotmail.com!"

,5870x2,2012-01-24T11:55Z," I recently built another cheap gaming system and this might be a possible fix for all who run AMD dual core processes running Win 7 64 bit and find that the game hangs at the
Call of Duty Black Ops ""Press Any Key"" window.
1. Get out of the game if you are in it [Control Alt Del] use the Windows task Manager to end the game.
2. Press start key in the ""Search Programs and files"" type MSCONFIG. left click on to the found msconfig.exe and when the system configuration utility pops up click on the BOOT Tab and then inside that window click on the advanced tab.
This will bring up the BOOT Advanced Options.
3. Un-check the box [if its ticked] ""Number of processors"" in fact make sure everything inside of the Boot advanced options is unchecked.
Exit this by clicking OK then click the ""Apply""
button back in the System Config window then
OK to Exit. Restart your PC and Restart COD Black ops, hopefully you wont have the hanging issues and the game will start properly. This not only fixed COD but also Rage, Batman Arkham Asylum, Call of Juarez BIB, red Faction. Spacemarine 40K and a shit load of other Games that now work with decent frame rates with all the eye candy turned on. I turn disable everything running in the back ground like Virus Protection, internet Connection etc anything the sucks up system resources while trying to play games.

,Angerfist92,2012-02-15T21:53Z,"First of all, I want to thank AiTB for the game!

Now, let's get to the point.

I've downloaded the game and I did everything that you're supposed to do.

1. Unpack release
2. Mount image or burn it
3. Install
4. Copy the cracked content from the SKIDROW folder on the DVD
to the main installation folder and overwrite
5. Play the game


The problem is, when I start the game it runs very good. Theyarch and the Activision movie runs absolutely great...also the small movie when a woman smokes a cigarr and keeps talking about some numbers, sounds like codes to me. After that when you come to the point when you have to ""Press Any Key"" the game freezes and I can't do a sh*t ! The only thing I can do is to press Ctrl+Alt+Delete to start the taskmanager and from there to shut the game down. It happens everytime I run the game. Do ANYONE have some ideas how to fix this kind of problem. I would appreciate it alot if someone could tell me. If you guys wonder what kind of system I have, I will tell you...here you go:

Processor: AMD Athlon LE-1640 (2.70 GHz Rated to 3.9) (((latest updates)
RAM: 4 GB
OS: Windows 7 Ultimate
Graphic card: NVIDIA GeForce 9800 GTX+ Black Edition (latest updates)

Note* 

Both motherboard and graphic card is installed with latest updates from www.nvidia.com

Anything else:

Computer space: 2750 GB (3 harddrives)
Case: Antec 900 Ultimate Gamer Case
