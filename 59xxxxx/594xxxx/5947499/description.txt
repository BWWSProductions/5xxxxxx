Release Notes:
This disc is a landmark collaboration of two small doses
favorites. jenks miller, perhaps best known for his work
under the horseback moniker and nicholas szczepanik come
together for an incredible recording that runs the gamut
between lilting, minimal drones to dark, dense harsh
soundscapes. the discs closer, cranberry sauce, was
featured on the most recent wire tapper compilation from
wire magazine.
