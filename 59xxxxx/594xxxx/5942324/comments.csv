,MaximilianKohler,2011-03-31T03:20Z,"quality's good I guess, it's just the way the movie's made. would need to compare to a blue ray copy to properly be able to rate it, but I've downloaded quite a few of these(machete 2010) from TPB and this is the best(and biggest) so far.
audio on this one is really really nice though."
