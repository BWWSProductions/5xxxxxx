Eleven tracks of soul-infused alternapop, Scrambodia conjures the infectious hooks of Sly and the Family Stone, the production wizardry of Beck, and the electrofunktastic street sounds of the Future Shock era. The style is catchy: throwback but forward-looking. The trademarks are all there: the harmonies, the horn lines, the left field song changes. And now Signor Groove adds breakbeat funk to his already kaleidoscopic palette. (Not to mention the tripped out keyboard sound made famous in The Rockford Files Theme song.) From the hip-shaking clav riff of \"Quarterhip\" to the absurdist, P-Funk-esque jam \"Pirate Killer Got Seasick\", Scrambodia is candy for your ears.
