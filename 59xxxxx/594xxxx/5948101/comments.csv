Mount the Call of duty-black ops, install it, it's very important to find a proper crack( you must copy both files= Call of duty - black ops and Steamclient.dll in directory)!! 

Worked perfectly for me! Cheers"

,DevilsDog,2012-02-03T15:54Z,"Wow some people are just plain stupid. ""oh mp isn't working"" , ""how come multiplayer doesn't work?"".
Well my answer would be that well, it's a CRACKED game! Don't fucking complain about it if your too stupid to know what it's capable of doing. If you want to play multiplayer buy the game. Wouldn't recommend it though as this game is shit. 

@Cyberpiraten thank you for uploading this torrent."
