i saw the pink dots last thursday 10/21 and picked this up at the merchandise table. it is a 2 disc set of some live recordings from france in 1994. they are dat recordings and the sound quality is extraordinary. i'm not going to list all 22 songs, but some of them are: crack in melancholy time, fifteen flies in the marmalade, premonition 13, love in a plain brown envelope, space captain and crushed velvet to name a few. they have a full band line up: silverman, niels van hoorn, martijn de kleer, ryan moore, raymond steeg and ka-spel. the cd artwork is fantastic and is designed by jesse peper (check out his website sometime, very lovecraftian). all in all, one of the better live recordings by the dots. highly recommended.
