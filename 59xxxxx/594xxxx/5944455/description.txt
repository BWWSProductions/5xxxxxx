Review:

A group of young teenagers run into a group of murderous redneck cannibals.Soon the woods are filled with screams of dying...Cheesy and lovingly cheap survival/hacksploitation flick with decent acting and insane mood.It owes a lot to Tobe Hooper's legendary "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". Director Kirk Alex holds the tension well with little flares like frantic POV shots.The gore is kept to minimum,but the brutality is quite strong for example there is a decapitation,throat munching and machete through the stomach.The hillbillies are suitably menacing as they stalk their human prey.If you are a fan of "Trapped" or "Hunter's Blood" give this low-budget oddity a look.7 cannibalistic rednecks out of 10.

This is a rather rare one, so if you want it, it's here. And to be fair, although it's a DVD rip, it does seem more like VHS. I guess that's just the best quality out there!
