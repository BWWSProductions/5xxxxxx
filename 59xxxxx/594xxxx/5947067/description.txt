London based composer and producer James Fussey dedicates his studio time to fusing his wide range of influences from Mozart's Choral Masterpieces to Verdi, Bach & 70's Disco alongside harsh industrial bass synths and just about any other samples he can get his hands on.

James' career in Dance music kicked off in 2008 when legendary DJ Dave Pearce played his Trance anthem 'Tears from Saturn' on his BBC Radio 6 show. James consequently went on to win the bedroom producer prize for best unsigned artist and was interviewed live on air by Dave Pearce about his influences and background in music.

James first became involved with Urban Sickness Audio in 2009 when he was selected to remix Dark Disco anthem 'Never Enough' by VAHN. The quality of his work along with his desire to produce more material for the label led to the creation of 'Audio Lad' and the release of his debut single, Electro House anthem 'It's All About You' featuring the vocals of Micky P.
