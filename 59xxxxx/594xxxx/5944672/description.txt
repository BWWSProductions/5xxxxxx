	The result is a beautifully produced, eclectic album of music that revives Desmond's *bossa antigua* idea and sends it in different directions, directly toward Brazil and various Caribbean regions, as well as back to the jazzy States.

Seventeen years a member of the Dave Burbeck Quartet, a long and highly successful career, thousands of miles of travelling all over the globe, more than 50 LPs, and that all-time favourite *Take Five* to boot - and then Paul Desmond decides to go it alone in 1967! Unfortunately, he was granted only a few years in which to concentrate on his solo career before his untimely death - and we fans have only a few LPs to listen to and enjoy his soft and gentle timbre and his rhythmic qualities which, thank heavens, are not dominated by the â€˜man at the pianoâ€™.
Don Sebesky knew how to enhance the highly varied compilation *Summertime* with Paul Desmonds tenor saxophone. The numbers range from Louis Armstrongs *Struttinâ€™ with Some Barbecue* (Satchmo would probably have some trouble in recognizing his theme!) to the Beatles White Album and *Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da*. Film music such as *Lady In Cement* and the waltz *Someday My Prince Will Come* offer Paul Desmond an opportunity to display his talents and to sparkle with his special hallmark of playing tricky 5/4 and 7/4 metres.
The climax he has reserved for the final number: his version of Gershwinâ€™s *Summertime* from *Porgy and Bess* is one of the most lovely and lyrical ever â€“ and completely free of schmaltz.
This CTI album from Paul Desmond is, despite the large number of horns, a real pleasure - thanks to that magician in the recording studio, Rudy von Gelder, whose genius has captured this large ensemble on tape for our enjoyment.

Personal Note

With my vinyl transfers, I try to catch the whole beauty of vinyl records; therefore I don't use any post-processing or any sound improvement. What you get is a clear and flat transfer. For getting a clear sound, I'll do an extended washing of each record with my RCM, which can take up to 30 minutes brushing on each side. Resistant ticks and clicks I try to remove as good as possible, but the priority is not to lose any musical information in the process. Surface noises, as long they are not too high, are left in place. Only on bad pressings or on records recorded at extremely low levels do I use a fade in-/-out. As John Peel said, "Life is full of surface noises." In some cases this means that I have to make a compromise.... The result has to pass my personal quality criteria, which is IMO quite high.
