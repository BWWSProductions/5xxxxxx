I have been a member of tpb for about 2 month and have already become a trusted member. I use The old Internet Explorer 7 and till this afternoon have had no problem uploading my torrents. I upload around 10 a day. About 21 30 hrs uk time i tried several times to upload 4 different torrents to the bay and each time i get a complete white screen with the words ""could not open socket in top left hand corner. I have checked recent torrents and nobody else seems to be having a problem uploading. So i tried to log in to this forum and it would not accept my pirate bay username and password. I tried to reg and it said my email is being used by somone else. Can sombody help me with this coz its driving me mad. Thanks."
