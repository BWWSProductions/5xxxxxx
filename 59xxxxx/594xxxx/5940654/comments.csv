,vivatpb5776,2011-03-30T23:51Z,"The aspect ratio is all wrong. It looks as if the image was squeezed into a full screen format. Additionally, there should be no reason to convert the movie into any other format. It should be ready to go from the completion of the download. Finally, the video quality is terrible. Not sure what kool-aid ThoSn is drinking but this definitely does not rate a 10...at best:

Video - 3/10
Audio - 6/10"
