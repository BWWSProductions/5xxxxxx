Had this here once before but then had a failed hard drive and could not get all the files back in place and since no one seems to bother to re seed these days I just had to start fresh.  So here it is again and hopefully more of you out there will not just remove it from your client as soon as you are done.

This is one of the most addicting classic games of it's time. The story sucks you in and the gameplay won't let you go.
I have incuded a readme file if you need help installing and also included dosbox if you need it and don't want to search (it is tiny anyway and you will need it to play)
There is a full walkthrough here

Have fun! And RE-SEED!
