,WARFDEE,2010-11-11T03:17Z,If you want to download this I advise you to read on.  This is the second time I have posted this and both times the initial response of downloaders was large but once again everyone stops seeding as soon as they have the files.  So what happens now is I have removed the executable file that you will need to play the game.  I will add the file back at random times and only for a short while so if you are not seeding what you already have at the time you will miss it and be stuck.  May seem like a not so nice thing to do but all you people that don't want to follow the proper curtiousy rules of the community need to take off becasue you are wrecking things for the rest of us.
