Little Ship is the fourteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter Loudon Wainwright III, released on October 6, 1997 on Virgin Records/Charisma Records. According to Wainwright, the album "focuses primarily on the theme of a relationship. In terms of the other records, I don't know how or why I would place it somewhere except that it's the newest."
