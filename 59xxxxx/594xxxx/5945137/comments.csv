Not worth Downloading"
,bjr2293,2010-12-27T00:19Z,"Fred's right.  Wish I'd seen his comment.  It's not much off, but the A/V sync is off enough to be noticeable. Don't waste time to download this.  "
,shawnduhast,2010-12-29T19:53Z,"such a shame the sound is out of sync :-( 

as the picture and sound are excellent for this size!

LTT please re-do it and correct the sound sync :-)"
,sonofdog,2011-01-09T11:09Z,You can adjust the sync in vlc. I'll give it a risk and see.
