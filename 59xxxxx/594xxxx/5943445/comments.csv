,xtdoog,2010-11-16T05:05Z,"I'm downloading now!!!!
seed plx"
,Buk_Lao,2010-12-09T02:14Z,Hundreds of downloads and only one comment. I am disappointed.
,omgnames,2010-12-10T07:44Z,"seems to be working fine and installation was super easy, however its telling me its a trojan which a lot of torrents do so I'm disregarding and also how do I change the resolution it always gets reset to 1024x768 thank you"
,felhasznalonev666,2010-12-10T14:39Z,"I'm dissapointed too, 'cause it is really fake :("
,Buk_Lao,2010-12-11T20:37Z,Why would 67+ people be seeding a fake game/trojan? You're full of shit.
,Buk_Lao,2010-12-11T20:58Z,"@omgnames
I Honestly do not know why the resolution is resetting. I believe you may be able to change it manually by editing some of the game files... Try playing a level after you make the changes and then quit."
,felhasznalonev666,2010-12-13T15:59Z,"And you have a very sensitive soul, don't come out in front of public if you can't take critics! I see 27 seeders at the moment, that doesn't mean anything.
I just try to warn others abut my adventures with this .exe>> I wasn't able to extract/install it, then when I tryed to delete it, it copyed itself in D:\System Volume Information, a partition of the HDD that is very difficult to acces and delete content from there-a typical virus/troyan behavior.... Now, it's up to you to decide.... ;)"
,nekti,2010-12-16T02:07Z,There is in fact a trojan...in the keygen..but still theres another problem..when i start d game it tells me that there has been an buffer overrun..witch i think means someone could hack your pc when u go playing online...dont know 4 sure...
,nekti,2010-12-16T20:57Z,Correction...it means your graphic driver is either too old or too new...
,FUZZbaLLL,2010-12-23T16:24Z,"Shut up guys... the torrent only took me about 2 hours to finish. I extracted, Ran the .7Zip, chose where to extract the game to, and finished it. the extraction of the game itself only took about 5-10 minutes, and both CoDUO and CoD worked just fine. the keygen shows as a virus because of the fact that it is a hack. it WON'T hurt anything. all the keys it gave me didn't work, so I just found one online. Thank you Buk_Lao for the awesome torrent, I'm seeding."
,doomherald3000,2011-01-08T23:22Z,"Amazing. It works great and installation is a breeze.

          Step 1:
     Download the torrent (duh)
          Step 2: 
     Open the 7zip file and wait for it to extract.
          Step 3:
     Go to the new Call of Duty folder.
          Step 4:
     Select one of the games.
          Step 5:
     Play the game.
          Step 6:
     ENJOY!!!!"
,Kyully,2011-02-13T18:17Z,Thank you for the torrent.
,GrawCube,2011-02-19T14:59Z,I hope it works. Don't want to waste my time on bullshit ;)
,kreka2,2011-03-30T15:27Z,"i need serial key for united offensive MULTIPLAYER because i cant open this one on torrent

Please help me

torrent is great nice job"
,Mr.Wolfe,2011-08-19T00:09Z,"In spite of the fact that I know what it is, the trojan warning still worries me when it pops up. Scans completed and no serious problems were detected, the folder and contained files seem to be acting normal."
,asd08,2011-11-11T14:21Z,"Work great ...

Keygen (After Extraction) scanned by KIS 2012 and it is clean ...

So It is not virus or trojan ... So It is false positive ..."
