,bobthebomb2004,2010-11-08T06:51Z,"@fetal i completely understand with what your saying. But i gotta disagree til dicks like u can post ur own torrents u dont need to criticize others work.

Mark the language next time. Skull brings responsibility, Try taking that seriously next time. Will report back on this torrent after watching.


and p.s let me might add read the title (The.Horde.2010.DVDRip.Xvid.English.UniverSalAbsurdity) so maybe next time u can be a smartass instead of a dumbass."
,Jeg_leger,2010-11-08T13:09Z,if this is in french then fuck the uploader
,LuckyStrikeNor,2010-11-08T15:38Z,"Imdb says french audio (some chetczh as well). Trailer at Imdb had a american ""cool-voice"" narrator. So it's dubbed or a English remake?"
,LuckyStrikeNor,2010-11-08T17:19Z,"The spoken language is indeed ENGLISH, dubbed that is. A/V is good, as for the movie don't know yet."
,bmaines78,2010-11-09T02:19Z,Thanks.....played in vlc and sounds english to me.
,xXSomalianPirateXx,2010-11-09T06:26Z,"Wow. I'll start by saying the rip quality of the movie was fine, and then I will go on to give a movie review.

So drug dealers and cops, which for some reason still operate in a world with fucking zombies, find themselves having to team up to live another day. For having such a possibly good premise, the plot really sucks in this movie. But then again, who needs plot when there is a Nigerian guy blowing people's heads off with a shotgun. That said, I was displeased with the plot, and the mindless gore was boring."
,arnold8100,2010-11-09T13:45Z,i saw it when it was called la horde. i must say i like it better in french cant tell what the saying its always a suprise when they shoot each other in the head but good movie none the less and good quality

Thanks UniversalAbsurdity, this looks like my kind of movie. Cheers mate."
,3rdAdam,2010-11-10T06:37Z,"there alot of people who will download movies for free and still complain. Be happy your getting it for free. 

Fetel19 might be releasing his sexual frustration in the only way he knows how, by being a tosser"
,dlarrym1111,2010-11-10T07:56Z,"IMBD Does state that the Language is French and some Chezh. HOWEVER if you read carefully, it says there is an INTERNATIONAL VERSION on the Canadian Blu-Ray version and that it was shown at the LEEDS horrer fest. (TO all idiots, LEEDS is a venue located in ENGLAND A ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRY DUMB ASSES!!!!!) Hold judgement until someone confirms it is not in English. Even if it isn't in english, have all of you who are reeming this uploader out ever made a mistake. . . . You all talk like your Omnipotent and free from making a mistake!!! I wish I was as smart as you all THINK you are. LOL. the EGO's found on these comments are Brazen to say the least. You all think because he has a SKULL, he isn't able to make an error. Lucky for you all that in your job or community, you are not judged so harshly. SO you all need to SHUT THE FUCK UP. . . I am about to blow a wad in your mothers mouth and all this yapping of gums is freezing me up. If I can't nut, I at-least slap your mothers face with a large, flaccid floppy wet dick right across her face and it will be your fault she didn't get the MONEY SHOT right between her eyes!!!! LMFAO!!!!! Here is the look of your mangy mothers face  -> :~O LOL...HAAAAHAHAAA! you can all eat my grandma's douche bags!!!!"
,highlander777,2010-11-10T08:39Z,"How come garbage like this is in the top 100 of TPB and ""Let Me In"" is still NOT listed at all??? "
,Wisper83,2010-11-10T18:08Z,The Horde is aired in 2009 not like the torrent title says 2010
,Nergalsyn,2010-11-10T18:56Z,"To the assholes complaining about the movie description, shut the fuck up you spoiled brats. You fuckers complain even when you get shit free. Like you dicks are so special, everything should be perfect for you. I've got news for you, it's not. 

Thanks to the uploader. This movie is off the chain, a perfect blend of zombie, & siege movie. If you can't read, nor have the desire to do so, download a different movie, perhaps one without subtitles."
,hurka79,2010-11-10T22:14Z,"Én most magyarul írok mert magyar vagyok.Ez egy szar minőség lehet-bár még nem töltöttem le, de sajnos akárki rak fel valamit , az nem olyan mint amit EZTV vagy társai raknak fel.Amúgy vegyétek meg a boltban!"
,shinobiXRT,2010-11-11T17:38Z,"moved out of the top 100 pretty fast, youtube trailers are very deceptive.
