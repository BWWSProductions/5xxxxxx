Android user deserves all in one sys manager.
1. Console terminal:
All adb cmds, ssh connection, gedit(or vi)
(Check network firewall if ssh connection isn't working)
2. Task killer / manager, CPU manager
3. CPU performance level setting
4. NAND and SD card benchmark test + explorer + low memory killer
5. Battery manager
