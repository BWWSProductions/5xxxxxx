Release Notes:

Brand new, eminent full-lenght album from
HELLVETO!
nearly two hours of majestic and epic pagn black
metal at its very best!
Album that sews together black metal firepower
with a substantial orchestral element that is dark
and haunting
deluxe 8- panel DOUBLE DIGIPACK in embossed
slipcase with gold print features bonus CD
Trilogy summarizing the three album saga with
special, extended and exclusive versions of
musical themes known from the last three albums

Being around for fifteen years now, and having the
dozen of albums released, HELLVETO is much
respected act in the todays black metal
underground scene. Leading by LON, as the one and
only song-writer and craftsman behind the entity,
HELLVETO started with the intention of honouring
proud and barbarian Slavonic ancestral heritage,
setting a solidified antichristian mission
statement, through their triumphant orchestral
black metal.

The new album Wiara, nadzieja..., potepienie,
(which can be translated as Faith, hope...,
damnation) is by far the most complete, coherent
and aggressive recording HELLVETO has done to
date, both musically and production-wise. The
album was recorded and mixed at LS Studio with the
band member himself handling all the production
duties and performing all the instruments,
including the entirely live drums.

The album is also the third and the final chapter
in the three album saga, the Trilogy that
started with the Od poudnia na pnoc CD in
2008 and developed on Kry in 2009.Wiara,
nadzieja..., potepienie contains all the elements
that can be find on the previous records, sewing
together gloomy black metal with an epic and
beautiful orchestration. To summarize the Trilogy
concept theres a bonus CD added, entitled
Trilogy which features extended and exclusive
versions of musical themes known from the last
three albums. It will be a huge feast for the new
fans as well as for those who have followed the
band through the years.
