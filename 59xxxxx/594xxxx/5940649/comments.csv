What is A/V ????"
,KickassWashingMachine,2010-11-20T12:07Z,"The internet is, in a way, a ""Commnet"", if that is really short for ""communications network"".

A/V is short for ""Audio/Video"".

Any other questions?"
,KickassWashingMachine,2010-11-20T12:40Z,"Okay, if this is a Pay-per-View rip, then someone in Russia or Afghanistan must be the one to have paid to view this clearly bootleg cam version being broadcast as PPV. Even the aspect ratio is fucked. Note to ripper: If you're willing to rerip a cam source just because it's being broadcast as PPV, then there's seriously something wrong with you.

At least this one is 4:3 instead of stretched into even more nastiness like the iMAGiNE version.

A:1
V:2"
