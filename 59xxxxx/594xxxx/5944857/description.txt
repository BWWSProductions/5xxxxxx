Click on "Files" tab (lower part of program-window) - right-click on file you 
don't need - choose "Don't download". (uTorrent would show "Skipped").
Other torrent-programs offer very similar step.

*** You would seed JUST the things you choose to download. ***
*** SHARE with others - keep your upload speed at 80% of your max ***
*** during the download. DO NOT force me to block and ban selfish ***
*** and greedy downloaders - as happened March - May 2010.  ***

*** 2-pass encoding for PC, PS3 or Xbox . ***
*** Video is H264; audio is AAC LC and container is MP4. ***

REQUESTS ARE "FROZEN" (AGAIN).
