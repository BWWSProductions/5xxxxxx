[V],twentyforty,2010-11-09T22:41Z,"@signalboy: I don't have such experience. It is impossible - audio goes through volnorm filter calibrated at 98% of standardized SPL... always.

For n-Th time - PEOPLE have problems, mostly because they have been used to (and adjusted sound levels on playback systems) -9 to -12 dB (what is 1.5-2 TIMES) too low sound levels - improper but sadly common practice of encoders in most of the .mkv and fewer XviDs.

Even my brother in law has problems with his standalone - player+s firmware EXPECT such low levels and automatically make volume louder - and I have not to say how stupid it is...

For sake-of-god change the player, check the settings (some morons complained about the same - having their VLC set to automatically amplify volume 500%!!!) - do fucking things I have said  you before. 

You HAVE the reason, right? IF you refuse to adopt any of my advices - your stupid bitching makes sense just to - yourself.

So - I repeat: It is technically impossible. Beside that - I CHECK all files before the public relese.

Anything else is matter of medical professions - not mine. Sound in my encodings was and always would be - excellent. "
,justregged,2010-11-09T22:58Z,Thank you for weeds +1
,justregged,2010-11-09T23:02Z,Just to add i have never had a problem with sound on any 20-40 encodings so ask yourself if it is only the odd person who has a problem then is the problem with the encode or the odd person?? The answer is obvious right??
,lilars26,2010-11-10T00:10Z,The audio sounds fantastic on a surround sound system.You should be proud.
,b00g,2010-11-10T01:04Z,"except the composing to a pack, everything you do is brilliant 20-40!

I can live with the pack! 
You have become a very reliable ressource for my pleasure!!! Thanks!

,punk67,2010-11-10T07:27Z,"@signalboy seen as noone else is having problems with audio does that not suggest the problem lies with you!also noone is making you download twentyfortys torrents so if your unhappy take your moaning ass and fuck off somewhere else you prick!i have never ever had any audio or video problems with twentyforty torrents and used them in many different players and converted them to disc!ive been using twentyforty for along time and he is one of the most reliable,consistant uploaders out there though god  knows why he still does it when ungratefull wankers like you are always fucking complaining!thanks for all your perfect uploads twentyforty dont let some dick rips you off!"

[V],twentyforty,2010-11-10T08:11Z,"@signalboy: ""Excellent"" is relative term, idiot. If I wanted to be delusional - as you surely are - I would use absolute term, moron - as ""best"" or ""greatest"".

Characteristic of lunacy is when one's opinion stands before ones of other people. You simply refuse to listen, and you're left alone in your cuckoos nest.

Audio track in Conan  is fucking 1.14 MB - 44 minutes.
Decent mp3 song has 4 MB and is 4 minutes long."
,kzrockz,2010-11-10T09:47Z,thnkx for HIMYM & 2 & half men.

[V],pluto999,2010-11-10T16:58Z,@signalboy: may be you ain't getting your signal right.. boy your signal is screwed.. Dude either get your shits straight or go somewhere else.
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-10T17:52Z,"@signalboy: Your ""you're deaf"" sounds about right. I am whatever you say, right? 
So what?
What you would do about?

You are - nobody, Zilch, Zero. A pixel.

I am 20-40 and you can do shit about 586 000 downloads I have in past six months nor you can change shit nor opinions of people.

I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce.

,Kencoldman,2010-11-11T14:05Z,Thank´s a lot for all your hard work. I´m missing Hawaii 5 O episode 7 I looked in some of the tv pack´s but could not find it. if you could help. Thank´s hope i´m not asking to much.
,Kencoldman,2010-11-11T14:19Z,Oh and signaljerk you must have some setting´s wrong on your player. I had the same problem some time ago but instead of automatically yelling at 20-40 Who by the way gives us the best small encode out there for years. I checked and put everything back to normal and excellent. Alway´s has been on the normal small encodes. So go sling your crap some where else and stop complaining about something you get for free.
