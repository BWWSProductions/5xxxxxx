in this animated update of the hit motion picture, the Ghostbusters are up to the same old tricks, keeping New York City safe from demons, curses, spooks and every other off-the-wall weirdness known (and unknown) to mortal man. The team is back - Peter, Ray, Egon and Winston - and this time they have help from their old nemesis Slimer, a new arsenal of weapons, and even an occaisional assist from their faithful secretary Janine Melnitz. Who you gonna call? Ghostbusters!
