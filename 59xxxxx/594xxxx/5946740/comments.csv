,MajinCry,2010-11-11T17:52Z,Damn. No Seeders. I was really wanting this one too D:
[H],HeroMaster,2010-11-11T19:51Z,"@MajinCry there are seeders dude, if you will start downloading the torrent it will show you the exact seeders and leechers, according to TPB the stats have a problem so seeders and leechers are not showing up."

,Humdrumpanic,2010-11-20T16:20Z,"What CIOS does everyone use to get this to work? 

I am currently using cIOSX_rev20b-Installer installed to the default base. I have a ntsc Wii and I was using usb loader gx with forced ntsc and various IOS's(222,223,249,250) were used and I still got nothing. 

So any help as to which CIOS to get would help out please and maybe a different loader although I've never had a problem getting a game to work with usb loader gx with the right CIOS."
