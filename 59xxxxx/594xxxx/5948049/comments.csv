,mucok,2011-05-25T17:27Z,"I haven't listened to them all but there is a distortion and some kind of a buzz sound in Had To Cry Today album. E.g at exactly 05:16 minute of Had to Cry song. That was just an example. There were that buzz at some other places also. It seemed like the disconnection of a cable...
Thanks anyway... Great job!"
