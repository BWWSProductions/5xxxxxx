,bigdave84,2011-01-14T16:20Z,"Actually it is Season 5,I have checked and verified. it's just that the files and folder were mislabelled. 
See following for episode guide :

,Dragonite_9,2011-02-02T23:46Z,"Both season 5 and 7 are correct, depends on how you see it, since before it was season 5 and now they have remade the old seasons and put seasons together, so it was season 7 before!

Anyone know if any new episodes are coming?"
,Dragonite_9,2011-02-22T19:32Z,"Ehm I don't want to be that guy since all is ""free"" but give at least credit to the one who originally uploaded it, and  looking on the dates it was this guy:

Just changed this to Season 5, which it became after they remade a lot of episodes.  "
,blackdragon13,2011-03-11T02:39Z,tvrage says it season 4
,JohnShit,2011-07-15T16:46Z,What the fuck! This is season 7! It seems all Bear Grylls episodes are fucked up. How hard is it to label some episodes correctly?
,JohnShit,2011-07-15T16:47Z,"You've got one episode in there twice - labelled as two different episodes in one, and none in another. *sigh*"
,Specral,2012-04-14T02:25Z,"This is season 5, the correct listing is on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Man_vs._Wild_episodes"
