,Joe1Fixer,2010-12-03T20:06Z,"Thanks for up, works great.

Does anyone know how to get cheat codes for this?  or know how to set it.  C'mon, it's better with suit transformation availble...   and Peach is waiting in that other castle."
,Joe1Fixer,2010-12-27T13:46Z,"I had to generate the cheat codes myself, here's how.  On a Configurable USB Loader: (I'm using loader V56 and Wii 4.2u)

1. DL the cheat codes for the 2009 Wii NSMB, you'll get two files in sd\usb-loader\codes, they're SMNE01.txt and SMNE01.gct.

2.  Use a PC to make copies of the above 2 files, copy and rename new files to HBWE01.txt and HBWE01.gct.

3.  Turn on Ocarina in game options, enjoy.

-- Remeber, I outlines the method for the Configurable USB Loader, you may need to make necessary changes for different systems.  But the jest of is the same, the same codes works on both games.  

However, the codes does not work on the NSMB Next Levels Wii game for some reason, I got a parse error when trying this method.  

Additionally, this game is in English and NTSC format, but there's a splash screen at the beginning that's all in Spanish.  "
,sexpanther,2011-01-18T03:20Z,Holy Christ but this is a hard freaking game!  Really well done - i've been loving it.  Thanks for the how-to on the Ocarina cheats Joe1Fixer - that should take the edge off a little.  ;)
