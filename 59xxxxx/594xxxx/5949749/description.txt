Two years after his Approach dbut,
Subheim makes a new statement with No
Land Called Home, a second album which
refines their precise yet encompassingly
lush sound and defines more precisely what
this already acclaimed but still young act
is about.

A lot has happened since 2008 and
Subheims dbut album: the inception (and
later departure) of the Spectraliquid
label (headed by Subheim together with
Mobthrow), a plethora of remixes, live
concerts all across Europe, and a
relocation from Greece to London. In the
same way, Subheims sound has evolved and
matured greatly: from a prominently
electronic basis, this project has now
embraced a much more acoustic composition.
Live drums and strings, field recordings,
horns provide a very organic texture to
No Land Called Home, bringing at times a
resolutely jazz feeling to the deep and
sombre overall atmospheres. And, of
course, the much stronger presence of
vocals throughout this album also adds to
the human and soulful nature of this
album. Subheim live vocalist Katja lends
her voice to more than half of the tracks,
and Timothy N. Gregorys emotional
presence on The Veil confirms Subheims
talent at writing not only tracks, but
full songs.

At times gentle, at times epic, always
humane and evocative, No Land Called
Home is both the fruit and the invitation
to a deeply introspective contemplation.
Satisfied by neither completely electronic
droning nor a fully acoustic / rock
structure, Subheim create here a bridge
between both and manages to use the best
of both genres while keeping their sound
coherent, vivid and personal.

The cover art to Subheims dbut album was
showing the middle of a flowing river, the
one to No Land Called Home displays a
reclining tide, welcoming to birds and
people alike: the land has been reached,
whichever it might be.

We  are  a  small  group of rather  friendly
people  (with few exceptions!)  whod prefer
wasting   their   time   releasing  scatporn
instead of  ripping  those  crappy  (mostly)
electronic releases nobody even cares about.

Of  course  we  release  all  what  we  hate
because hate is a much stronger feeling than
love and when you  think about it,  there is
no  point  wasting   money  on  loved  ones.

Finally if you ever like one of our releases
(and not only ours...), go fuck a goat, sell
the video and buy the damn  vinyl/cd/dvd ...
... thats double pleasure !

We  would  like  to share  a goat  with  the
followings for their work and/or friendship,
of  course in -almost- no  particular order:

TrT - DPS - MAEM - mbs - bASS - kiNky - soup
sour - XTC - FWYH - D2H - BCC - BOSS - FMR
ETHNiC - CT - i8 - 1way - hM - SQ - HQEM
