Plot summary

This supernatural shockumentary about a demonic presence in a young coupleÃ¢Â€â„¢s home will leave
you begging for anything other than sheer realism.A tale of demonic possession, strange goings-on,
and human beings tortured to the brink of insanity by forces we donÃ¢Â€â„¢t fully understand, The Torment
portrays an explanation that defies logic as the hand held, point-of-view shooting puts the audience
into the characters heads.

Key to the action is the fact that the haunting isnÃ¢Â€â„¢t attached to a location but to the central
character himself, David OÃ¢Â€â„¢Reilly (Giles Alderson).The action unfolds as David turns up in the middle
of the night at the London flat of his friends Alex (Nicholas Shaw) and Kate (Zoe Richards) with the
explanation that his girlfriend has left him.Feeling sorry for him, they let David stay, but are totally
unaware of the real reason heÃ¢Â€â„¢s turned up for two weeks heÃ¢Â€â„¢s seen and heard things that have terrified him
so much,heÃ¢Â€â„¢s fled to what he hopes will be a safe haven.

Things take a dark turn as David confesses to believing he is being haunted. Can Alex, Kate and their
neighbour Anna (Francesca Fowler) believe him? Can they even believe their own eyes as events take a turn for
the worse?

The chilling story unfolds as the haunting continues over the next couple of nights with harrowing results.
Inspired by a real life domestic incident in which the police were called to a block of converted Victorian
flats where a perplexing and disturbing scene confronted them, The Torment shockingly displays the fear the
characters see as they try to escape the horrors they are faced with.
