That should do it.....sorry about the anonymous on the mummy. About half my torrents got put under anonymous. When edit is working again I will change them."
,X3MEX,2010-11-11T11:40Z,"Thanks, but can u keep seeding for a while, theres no seed ..ill seed after im done..

Also, i think u might want to include h264 or X264 on ur titlles like this one to get more peers'..i for one use h264 and x264 keywords to search for new torrents..and AVC rips are much better than xvids.."

Ok I will restart the mummy again let me know when you have it. I don't the greatest up speed so I put all the speed on the new ones.

I believe all my mp4's are h264/AVC, I will add that thanks."

Do u hav some other Classic horrors like Nosferatu(1922), The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1922),Vampyr (1932) etc. etc. would be great to hav it in h264 rip.."
