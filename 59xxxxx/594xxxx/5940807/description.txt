BROWNIE McGHEE NOT GUILTY BLUES
Label: Synergie OMP
CD Released: December 12, 2006
Format:Flac



Here's an 18-track collection of McGhee's earliest recordings, all of it emanating from sessions held in 1940 and the following year. Brownie's recordings as Blind Boy Fuller #2 are here, as well as the first recordings pairing him with longtime future partner Sonny Terry. His work with washboard player Oh Red and the mysterious Jordan Webb playing harmonica is every bit as effective, though, Tracks like "Picking My Tomatoes" and "Born For Bad Luck" get this set off to a wonderful start; the musical quotient stays high all, the way to the end.
