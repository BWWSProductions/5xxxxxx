,mitcjase,2010-11-08T07:01Z,350 MB? That's pretty damn small for being supposedly HD and at least an hour long. Will someone confirm quality?
,moodude,2010-11-08T07:10Z,Who watches TV anymore when you can fucking own the Episode a few hours/minutes after it airs? Epic
,xtremality,2010-11-08T07:15Z,awesome thanks!
,jackman234,2010-11-08T08:23Z,i was surprised to see this up 15 minutes after it finished airing....
,jackman234,2010-11-08T08:28Z,"i was surprised to see this up a mere 15 minutes after it finished airing... not displeased obviously, merely surprised"

,urza4315,2010-11-08T10:25Z,"Odd, this release seems to have poorer quality uncharacteristic of FQM's releases."
,Quad-K,2010-11-08T10:36Z,"Very nice follow up to episode 1,which left me in pure interest and awe of the series. Nice upload guys.

,udumbmuthas,2010-11-08T13:57Z,to bad somebody couldn't get S.G.U. up this fast and enough seeders to finish a quick d/l
,Scullyy,2010-11-08T14:20Z,"if it's the same length as the first episode, why is it so much smaller?"
,harvengure,2010-11-08T17:06Z,"So I'm a bit disappointed...the show is good but this file compared to the first one is not quite as good.  General info found below but basically while the sound is very good the visual quality is not as high as last time.  It's more like a DVD that has been reduced for size causing some video noise and posterization.  Beyond that it's good...so overall...

,dawnthief,2010-11-09T01:56Z,"For fuck sakes people, AT LEAST WATCH THIS ON TELEVISION

If everyone just downloads, it isn't going to get renewed...."
,FrFly,2010-11-09T03:51Z,Except it already HAS been renewed.
,lilazzhole,2010-11-09T04:14Z,"@ dawntheief
By your reasoning, you shouldn't even be on this site then... just sayin"
,makeyoubleed,2010-11-09T13:12Z,"@ dawntheief
it doesnt matter what is watched on cable tv that means anything...
it is the lousy Nielsen ratings that decides what stays on tv."
,hurka79,2010-11-09T14:08Z,Thanks!
,mershcakes,2010-11-09T16:36Z,thanks. this is a great show  I missed the ending though
,unoqvaydice,2010-11-09T19:17Z,"Tha quality is enough for this to be up in the web just right after showed on TV. Cheers on that

The ending of the chapter is missing along with 10-15 minutes, it is a shame but anyway thanks, and hope the s1e03 is full and complete!!!"
,lovablepain,2010-11-10T06:44Z,Very good quality!!!! Impressed and hope to see your upload for episode 3!! :)
,5iTH,2010-11-12T11:33Z,Thanks for the up!
,cockmongles,2010-11-24T20:54Z,"@dawnthief:

How the fuck do you think TV ratings are determined?  Siphoning unicorn farts down your cable line?

No, they're determined from people via surveys and set-top boxes in the Nielsen system, or feedback from places like hulu and TiVo, and they're then extrapolated to the general population based on demographics.  If you're not a Nielsen family or using one of these other reportable methods, watching or not watching doesn't fucking matter."
,RvdK,2011-01-01T21:25Z,Is this the full version or what?
,dkhere,2011-02-03T10:40Z,"Watched the first episode and my ass is on fire....
Thanks for the upload and thanks for seeding guys..."
,potlover6,2011-02-15T13:20Z,The pilot was brilliant. A TV series on zombie outbreak!!! I have just three words... Jesus Fucking Christ !!!
,psnake,2011-10-31T18:02Z,"For all the people saying watch this on TV so it doesn't get canceled. The season premier was viewed by over 7 million people, so i don't think it has a chance in hell of being canceled."
