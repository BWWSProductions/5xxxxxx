Release notes:

On Illuminations, Groban worked with veteran producer Rick Rubin, known for
his critically acclaimed work with Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Johnny
Cash, and Dixie Chicks among many others. Groban co-wrote the majority of the
songs, including Hidden Away, which he wrote with Dan Wilson - former leader
of the band Semisonic and co-writer of several cuts on the Dixie Chicks Not
Ready to Make Nice. Hidden Away was recorded live with Groban singing and
playing piano, Matt Sweeney and Smokey Hormel on acoustic guitars, and veteran
RB icon Spooner Oldham on organ, with a striking orchestral arrangement by
David Campbell added later. The opening piano chords and the unfolding melody
evoke a timeless Americana, a thread from Stephen Foster through Aaron Copland
through Paul Simon and Randy Newman, as Groban makes a heartfelt plea not to
hide true love or ones true self.

Illuminations finds both Groban and Rubin stepping out of each ones
respective zone and creating an entirely new zone. The bracing result fulfills
Rubins vision of a fine art Groban record, marrying the warmth of the
sweeping American roots of Grobans writing and the grandeur of classical
settings by matching the live, one-take performances by Groban and the intimate,
core acoustic band with colorful orchestral arrangements by David Campbell and
James Newton Howard.

Enjoy!
