Peter Highman (Robert Downey, Jr.) is on his way home to Los Angeles so that he can be there when his wife, Sarah, gives birth to their child, but another car rips the door off his ride at the airport. A man stares at him, and they accidentally switch bags when his are knocked over. After finding marijuana in the bag and having it confiscated, he boards the plane and notices that the same guy he switched bags with is in the seat behind him. When passengers are told to turn off cell phones, Peter tries to finish his text message to his wife. The man, Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis), an aspiring actor headed to Hollywood who went to Atlanta for his father's death, tells him to turn it off because attendants might assume he is a terrorist that will bomb the plane. Peter tell him to not say those words, but Ethan repeats them and Peter is asked to step to the front of the plane. After trying to explain, he is shot by the air marshal with a rubber bullet.
