--------------------------------

Game runs pretty good in DOSBox.
If you want full installation you need to set -freesize switch to more than 500.

If you would like to run this game in windows xp/vista/7 you need to use optical/virtual drive wich is closest to your HDDs. Best solution is to set your desired optical/virtual drive letter to D or as close you can manage. 
Use diskmgmt.msc to change drive letters.

If you don't hear the sound try to set it into a different configuration.

Enjoy!
