                    Contemporary drama series. When teenager Jack  
                    breaks into a pensioner's house, he finds more  
                    than he bargained for in Eddie, an ex-boxer.  
                    Eventually the two strike up a bond, and Eddie  
                    starts to train Jack. But when Eddie's late  
                    wife's rings go missing, the finger of   
                    suspicion falls firmly on the young protege.  
                    Could Jack have betrayed Eddie?
