Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time with whats available

well normally i dont do a V2, i do it right at the first time but i make a exception this time and here it is.
its a DVDSCR in my opinion not PPV.

I finally got the source for this movie (Gadkij.Ja.2010.D.SCR), which allows me to do a better copy now. didnt know i get that lucky. treated it like a r5, added sharpness bit brightness and chroma.
there is nothing cut or blurred, as we now there was something blurred at the left upper corner through the complete movie. it is a logo with the number "49" which pops up only 2 or three times for 3secs. so no need for a complete blurr, it is not bothering me so i let it as it was. same audio as my v1 which originally came from imagine release. still thx for that.
added beneath a screenshot comparison between v1 and v2 to see if its worth the second dl.
enjoy
