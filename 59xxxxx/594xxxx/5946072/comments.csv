,Green-Banana,2010-11-10T12:28Z,"Yeah, I was wondering why they stopped uploading these same-day, which is the remarkable standard we can be proud of on the internet.  

What's BiA or FoV?  Can't be too important--haven't heard of it before.  "
,thedarkrai,2010-11-10T15:30Z,"FoV and BiA are the best encoders from Britain...
Almost all best quality TVRips of BBC shows are done by them.....
And yeah the name is very important to me :)"

,Green-Banana,2010-11-10T21:13Z,"If you say so.  In other notes, I find it hilarious that suddenly a bunch of other torrents sprang up, but VIPs and whatnot no less, AFTER this torrent did.  

Gee.  "
,AlwaysTomboy,2010-11-11T03:40Z,Thanks so much for getting this ep posted so fast :)
,daveydalek,2010-11-17T10:11Z,"This torrent was as good quality as the others. The regular uploaders are not fans, they post a lot of other torrents."
