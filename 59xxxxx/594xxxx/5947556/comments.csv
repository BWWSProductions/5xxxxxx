,KingOtar,2010-11-17T10:15Z,The crack didn't work for me after following the instructions. Does anyone know of any alternate solutions?
,thewatchmaker,2010-11-25T13:44Z,"the crack doesn't work for me either, it doesn't seem to accept the crack. "
,redwing634,2010-12-18T01:27Z,"Add one more person that doesn't have this working. Followed instructions.. ""cracked"" .exe doesn't work. 

Don't download this torrent guys."
,billy9909,2010-12-27T15:36Z,"I found with my 2 computers it works perfectly with Windows 7, but doesn't work for me with Vista.  Don't know if the crack is meant for windows 7, but seems to work perfectly for me."
,elturbo9077,2011-01-19T03:01Z,this crap is boring is a click and point game its like myst 
,hahalolfailmupp,2011-03-14T00:13Z,"The game is awesome, nice story and its graphics is quite okay, the only sad part is that its short."
,Jestowe,2011-03-15T10:10Z,"I agree with elturbo.. This game is boring as fuuck. To compare it with Myst though is a huge insult to Myst. I played far into it and it's a mind numbing boring, slow point and click- not even an adventure. Requires no brain power. Story line gets crappier as you go. If you're looking for a creepy, or even puzzle adventure game like Myst. Don't download this. It was made for tween girls and window lickers. Just a waist of DL time and space. Took me 2 days to DL. I regret every second. "

Crack works great. Installed to default directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\Gray Matter) then copied Game.exe from Crack to said directory. Running on Windows 7 Ultimate x64."

,timminsmtmmns,2011-03-23T02:07Z,"Hello I've downloaded torrent, installed etc, and a pop up comes up saying 'Please enter LauncherButtonInstall in ini' whilst trying to do the crack. What does this mean? I am trying to play on Vista please help x"
,LiveInABox,2011-07-16T19:20Z,very disappointing game. Download and play Gabriel Knight 2
,Sintek,2011-07-26T23:10Z,"Adventure games are rare these days. Those under the age of 18 should probably avoid this - you can't shoot people, level up or acquire fat loot. The only satisfaction is from solving puzzles through logic and deduction, not things the memememe generation is accustomed to."
,druhklam_orbowetsch,2012-04-21T06:27Z,Many thanks!!!!
,kalemeh,2012-06-04T23:17Z,"I just wanted to give a quick review, contrary to some of the ones i'm seeing in here.

I'm only on the first chapter but:

Firstly...this game is nothing like Myst...at all...

It is also not like Gabriel Knight (1,2 or 3). I would recommend the Gabriel Knight series to anyone who hasn't played...but this game is not intended to be similar (especially not to 2)

I understand complaints about the game content wise...if it's not you're cup of tea (story and such) then so be it...but at the same time, I can't understand the complaints about play style in terms of adventure gaming. It is a pretty standard current point click style adventure game ...looks and plays like 99% of the adventure games made in the last 12 years...(except with an enjoyable twist imo, in the case of utilizing the protags magicianship).

If you are a fan of the Tunguska series or Black Mirror, Nancy Drew...you should like this. Again, i'm only a chapter deep, so the comparison is not in terms of quality or story...but just overall style/feel/gameplay...but I actually am getting Tunguska/Nancy Drew (for an older audience) vibes...perhaps do in part to the cheeky female protagonist among a few other things.

I get that people might have been expecting something different, being that it's a Roberta game...but I would implore you to remember, she's been pretty MIA for a long time... I didn't expect this to look anything like her 90's games. Again, I can't yet tell you if the story holds up to her legacy, but so far, i find it very intriguing."
,kalemeh,2012-06-04T23:26Z,"Edit: Jane Jensen/Roberta Williams era i believe is what i meant. It is a Jane Jensen game, but i believe people were expecting her RW/Sierra  era stuff like GK."
