,moldmakr,2010-10-22T23:36Z,THANK YOU
,gfmickel,2010-10-23T00:02Z,"Well, cbmtrx, for someone without any color skull and who has NEVER uploaded anything, you sure have a lot to say-lol.  Besides, do you see the pink skull by my name?  That means something.  Maybe it's your slow internet connection perhaps?  Anyway, as always guys, you're welcome and enjoy :-)"
,cbmtrx,2010-10-23T01:26Z,"nope, never uploaded anything but have seeded plenty. But that wasn't my point...I've d/l stuff from PB forever and suddenly today it quits.

No reflection on your excellent post but why it's not d/ling I have no idea.

I'm on cox cable btw...I think they're messing with my connection.

beware y'all"
,Lustr,2010-10-23T01:34Z,"Gfmickel,
Thank you so much ... I have been desperate to see this episode .. its caused quite a stir ... 
If i may be so bold, could I make a request?  Would you also upload the show after the finale'.  The one where they all get back together and review the season?  I would be very grateful.
Thanks for the great uploads... You Rock!!!"
,thefizdude,2010-10-23T02:11Z,"Thanks a lot gfmickel, nice upload!  By the by, my download finished in 20 minutes whoohoo, so no downloading issues whatsoever cbmtrx!  I'm now seeding, so come and get it!  "
,gfmickel,2010-10-23T02:24Z,"Thanks guys and, again, you're welcome :-)  Lustr, yes, I will upload the reunion show if I can find it.  No worries.  Cbmtrx, no worries.  Your initial comment insinuated that I uploaded a fake torrent or something.  Sorry about your issues with Cox and I hope you're able to resolve them so that you can download torrents again :-)"
