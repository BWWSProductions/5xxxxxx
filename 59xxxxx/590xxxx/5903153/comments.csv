,betabrain,2010-10-22T10:46Z,"paranoid people should download their own copy of ppf-o-matic or any ppf patcher they like. 
also, i checked the abgx.exe file:

,betabrain,2010-10-22T10:47Z,"for ppf-o-matic that i included:

,betabrain,2010-10-22T12:13Z,"ungodly release, once patched, passed verification in abgx

and all the levels and modes tested work 100% for me

i hope this helps you other poor bastards who got the bad rips on a slow connection ;)"
,Jamz2010,2010-10-22T20:25Z,ABGX's ability to detect wave 5 and 6 has nothing to do with the rip of the game.   Ungodly's rip is perfectly fine.
,betabrain,2010-10-23T16:10Z,"the wave update (which i don't use) just makes the output in abgx all green.

the ungodly rip might play but the game CRC isn't correct. my guess is it could get people banned and i suspect that's why so many people reported problems with it, like campaign mode not working...

i personally don't have live or worry about anything but playability. even if this patch doesn't help people not get banned, it might help if reach just isn't working right.

all i can say is my patched copy works awesome, but i didn't try burning/using it unpatched."
,betabrain,2010-10-23T16:11Z,"also, i am so fucking stoned and hung over right now it's insane"
,betabrain,2010-10-30T12:19Z,did this help anyone?
,bboyyooda,2010-11-04T14:18Z,"Thanks betabrain, its tested and its works im playing atm :)"
,remedy2,2010-11-14T08:29Z,Hey betabrain thanks for this.  I can confirm this green lights abgx all the way. I won't play anything that doesn't pass abgx.  Not trying to be a dick to ungodly but if you are going to rip and post you should make sure it passes abgx since that is what most people are going to use.  Anyway thanks for the combined effort.
,Downloadjunker,2010-11-23T00:07Z,thanks ran fine for me
,SaltSlasher,2010-11-26T07:13Z,"I usually just get the ss and dmi files off abgx360 myself and put them in but I dled the ungodly  and didn't and it came up short, so I just put the patch in myself and it's a ok.

Plus it dls in less than a half hour!
thanks for the info on your research!"
,deadvirgo,2010-12-12T21:34Z,this is good. betabrain is the shit. send him all your weed.
,fomorian27,2010-12-26T02:35Z,"What is this patch for? I burned the game w/o patch and got a coaster. Will this help?  I ran abgx to get the .dvd file, since dvd file and iso file in original torrent didn't have identical names, but the game still didn't work. What should I do?"
,fomorian27,2011-01-08T10:09Z,"sorry, but I'm not going to waste another precious dvd by trying to burn the dvd again after the patch, since there's no guarantee the game will work even after the patch. I'ma go find a different rip and use that instead."
,wrummery,2011-01-21T01:28Z,"Alright, I have an issue with this, I've applied the patch, and done what the readme has said, however when I try and run the agbX that was distributed with this pakage, abgx just throws out a quick command window then exits... so I switched back to good old abgX and ran it and I get this error:
Game Data was Verified but Stealth wasn't then autofix is set to level 3... what's up? am I able to use on live? or no? and if no, what can I do to make me live enabled?"
,doriean,2011-01-26T18:07Z,"So Everything Worked Great...I Just Used Abgx...That I Downloaded From There Website...Got Ppf-o-matic...From..http://www.afterdawn.com/software/cd_dvd/iso_tools/ppf-o-matic.cfm
Then I Used The Ppf File from This Torrent And Patched The Iso...

Step 1 Patch Iso
Step 2 Run Iso Thru Abgx
Step 3 Enjoy Halo Reach"
,Milner132,2011-02-22T18:03Z,"you absolute legend!!! My iso was bad but then I ran the iso through PPFoMatic with your patch and it works like a dream. Didn't need your copy of abgx360 tho.
NICE ONE!!! :)"
,Ack0BraTE,2011-03-08T13:50Z,When i want to insert patch it says can't open ppf. What i need to do???
,black_shadow_1981,2011-03-10T11:26Z,will this make my halo rach work again after the dragon age 2 disc dash update?
,Ack0BraTE,2011-03-13T19:02Z,Again. When i want to insert patch it says can't open ppf. What i need to do??? 
,K1l3rL3x,2011-07-15T02:48Z,Thankz it worked 
,wrecker14,2011-07-16T21:50Z,patch worked great ..  THX
,TBTORRENT,2011-08-08T13:47Z,Thx for this fix
,KLAIDAS21,2011-10-12T13:37Z,@Ack0BraTE insert your ppf file its inside your folder you have ppf exe abgx and ppf file not exe insert that
,Desto92,2011-10-16T12:04Z,"Thanks, that works!"
,gotmachine,2011-10-20T03:53Z,"omg you really are a hero

the ungodly rip is presumably fine (people have said it works but they dont care about live). However, I try to keep my LIVE as long as possible and therefore dont play anything that doesnt pass abgx.

Very easy to to understand readme instructions and a patch which worked beautifully for me. It just means I didn't want 8gb of download on halo reach. 

thank you very much"
,gotmachine,2011-10-20T03:54Z,waste* 8gb of dl not want* lol
,ClipperCigars,2012-04-22T08:15Z,"Yup, this works.

Thanks. "
