         Inside the Milky Way takes viewers on an astounding journey   
         across 100,000 light-years to witness key moments in          
         the history of the Milky Way. Using the latest science,       
         NGC constructs a 3-D state-of-the-art CGI model of our        
         galaxy. We'll peer into the heart of the Milky Way on the     
         hunt for super-massive black holes, watch how stars are       
         born and die, fly out and above the plane of our galaxy       
         to understand its true shape and scour its dusty spiral       
          arms for the possibility of life.

         Hybrid. About 90% video which is all the CGI. The live        
         human footage is film. I did a low threshold blend on the     
         film parts to get it to a smoother video rate. I left alone   
          the awesome graphic parts. This was indeed a great special!
