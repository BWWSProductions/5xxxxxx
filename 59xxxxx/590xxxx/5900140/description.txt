George Harrison - Got My Mind Set On You [second promo].VOB 



HQ alternate promo music video. Of Harrison's three number one singles in 
the U.S., this was the only song not written by Harrison, and the only one 
without religious overtones. Not only was this the last US number one hit 
by Harrison, but of any from the other Ex-Beatles in the US. This second 
promo video was directed by Gary Weis, and has Harrison sitting and playing 
in a study. As the song progresses, furniture and knick-knacks (like a stuffed 
squirrel and mounted warthog) begin to dance along with the song. In the middle 
of the video, Harrison's stunt double performs a backflip from his chair and 
follows with a dance routine before jumping back to his seat. This second promo 
received significant airplay, and was nominated for three MTV VMAs.
