About the file: The OP made the error of not paying close attention to the video framerate for BLU RAY when formatting the file. He made the error of using 24fps whereas Blu ray is 23.976. Now, that may not sound like much but it throws off the sync of the audio & causes a glitch when viewing the file. I had to remux the entire file back to the proper video framerate and remove the delay that had been entered into the Track#1(video) and then alter the stretch in the audio to get everything back to its proper run time.  Rookie mistake on the part of the OP. "

,nicoliani,2012-06-25T17:44Z,"Are you sure, because that applies for NTSC format. This source is Spanish and uses PAL so 24 should be fine, I will review it after the download."
,nicoliani,2012-06-27T16:54Z,There is no audio out of sync. I still recommend buying Blu-ray movies. The image and audio quality is so above this rips we get. You are worth Blu-ray for the movies you really like.
