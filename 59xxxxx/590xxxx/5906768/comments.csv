If you get a ""disc not recognized"" message, it's nothing wrong with your console [or the iso itself], as many people can attest to. [myself included]"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-10-24T15:03Z,Sunbleached. You mean 2.0.12416.0 BETA ?

,ermie03,2010-10-25T19:48Z,"@Djsmokey
You can play it in some sort of ""Co-Op""mode, same like Fable II"
,ermie03,2010-10-25T19:49Z,"@Djsmokey

Wait until 26(US) or 29(EU) and have the latest IXtreme flashed so there is less change of getting banned!!!"
,Nords1980,2010-10-25T22:34Z,"Well,  I just finished the DL and it doesn't work.  I know how to burn them and this just doesn't work.  My dashboard hasn't been updated in 3 years since I'm banned.  Just letting you guys know."
,Nords1980,2010-10-25T22:41Z,game is a hoax
,Nords1980,2010-10-26T00:45Z,"Abernick00  How did you burn it?  Did you create your own .dvd file?  I didn't get a .dvd file with the DL.   Anyway I made a new one like I normally do in this situation,  The burn went smooth but it doesn't work.  And I just DL'd SvR2011 and Star Wars Force Unleashed II and they work fine.  "
[T],Sunblock.,2010-10-26T11:36Z,Run it in abgx and it will make the .dvd for you.
[T],Sunblock.,2010-10-26T11:41Z,Most new games (not all) Required latest Dash. You can update Dash easy. Just use a USB Stick. You can find guides on Xbox.com or Google.
