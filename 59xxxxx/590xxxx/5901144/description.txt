
This episode, titled "Pathogen" (original air date: October 19, 2010) opens with Eli and Chloe in the control room. He's confused as to why she's there, and to be honest, so is she. She's apparently been "sleepwalking" (no good can come of this, I fear). Later, Eli and Scott are comparing notes, and coming up with many strange new Chloe-isms, which give them both (since they're both in love with her) some cause for concern. Young breaks in to their conversation to tell Eli to get to the communication stones because his mom is in the hospital, and while he's still talking, Eli dashes out of the room.
