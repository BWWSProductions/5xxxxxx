After rescuing Lumen from her horrific imprisonment, Dexter tries to convince her to leave Miami and return home to her family. Although the trauma that she suffered has made her both physically and mentally fragile, Lumen is determined to find the men that tortured and raped her and exact a justice on them that Dexter is all too familiar with. Now, Dexter's fallen angel has become an avenging one.

Should work in most players. If your unsure on what player to use, I recommend VLC Player (google it), its free and plays ALL movie types.
