,ninline,2011-05-10T22:17Z,"I replaced win7 home premium on my dell 1545 with this and haven't looked back.  It installed and everything just worked including wifi.  Never had anything install so perfectly, it was like it was made for the dell.  It's blazing fast on the 2.2ghz t4400 compared to win7 too.  Thanks for the hard work, looking forward to seeing what you all can do with 11.04 Unity.  I've run it in a virtualbox and can't say as I like it.  The way Super OS 10.10 is running I really don't want to change anyway."
