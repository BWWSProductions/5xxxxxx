				Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distilled from a lifetime of study and reflection on the life 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith... as only Truman Madsen can provide. 
Beautifully filmed on location at dedicated Church historical sites, 
the focus of this series is Joseph's place among world religions 
and his lasting influence. Truman not only illuminates the events 
and writings of the time, but touches on the deeper insights that 
elude the casual observer. As you walk with Truman Madsen you will 
find your way to the side and even the heart of Joseph. You will know 
that you are standing with him on sacred ground. An excellent resource 
of rare insights into both the life and the teachings of Joseph Smith. 

Video files are ripped from the original complete 4-disc DVD 
collection, which is currently SOLD OUT and going for enormous amounts 
on Ebay and Amazon.  Also I used Subrip to extract the DVDs' subtitles, 
and these .srt files are included as well.  Enjoy this tremendous gem
of spiritual wisdom, delivered by one of the most engaging LDS scholars 
of all time.
