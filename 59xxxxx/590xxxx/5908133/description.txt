These files are rips of two disks provide by Acer technical support in order to restore Windows XP onto an Acer Aspire One ZG5. This software is provided AS IS, and may or may not work with your Acer Aspire One. Please back up your critical data before using these disks as they will format your hard drive. You may use a burning program such as Brasero or InfraRecorder to burn these images to disk. You must use a DVD-R for the Restore Disc.

These disks cost $20 to order through the Acer website instead of being included in the purchase of the laptop. No love, Acer.
