[V],wilimaw,2010-10-23T21:55Z,"@ itzraywhy
it leaked out somehow and it is the real album,trust me

@ dragonballz
i'm only the uploader so you most ask TEAM DOH for the reason why they riped it at 194kbps,or you can wait for the 320 version

,HAHAlowlow,2011-04-07T16:13Z,"Look, this is most definitely NOT wilimaw's fault, but in 10 years of downloading torrents i have never received a warning from AOL about the RIAA complaining about me infringing on copy right protections by downloading torrents on a peer-to-peer program.........and this is the only CD i've downloaded via a torrent, outside of another taylor album[which im going to post this comment on too], in weeks!
So, i'm warning everyone that the likelyhood that the RIAA [Recording Industry Associate of America] is monitoring this torrent, is very-high.
Does that mean they'll email you too? No, they might skip you. But then again, they might not. And if you're on a isp with a fixed IP, and your isp has your real contact info, you might be in danger of the RIAA getting your contact info, and your ISP suspending your account.


But of course, i've learned my lesson and will never ever ever download a torrent again! *thumbs up?!* =D"
