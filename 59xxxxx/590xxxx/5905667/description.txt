*** Synopsis ***

From 1991 comes a very well filmed Pat Travers Band
from the Diamond Club in Toronto, Canada. The sound is quite impressive as well. Featuring the very capable Mars Cowling on bass and Jerry Riggs on second guitar, this lineup just pounds out these Travers classics as well as a handful of newer tunes from his "School Of Hard Knocks" release from the previous year. Probably Pat Travers at his hardest rocking best. This band pounds with the best of them, adding a new degree of hard rock to these already rocking tunes.
