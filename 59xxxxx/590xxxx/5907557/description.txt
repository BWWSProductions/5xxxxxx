"Follow ITU-R BT.601 Standard" option UNFLAGGED on Gordianknot as can be.

we tried also with option flagged (mistake but we tried) and gordian says that DVD resoltion is 2:66:1, so this is a inequivocable proof that 2:35:1 is in any case for sure wrong. 

To obtain 640x272 only solution is to change manually resolution "FORCING" 
AR.
