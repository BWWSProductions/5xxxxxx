The disclosure would comprise the biggest leak in US history, far more than the 91,000 Afghanistan war logs WikiLeaks released this summer.

- Juan Gonzalez: Controversial Evaluations System Will Unfairly Target New York Teachers

In his latest column, Democracy Now! co-host Juan Gonzalez says New York Schools Chancellor Joel Klein's plan to release 12,000 teacher data reports will unfairly tarnish city teachers.

- With New Limits, U.S. Military Reinstates "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"

The military's 17-year old on ban openly gay, lebsian, bisexual, and transgender people from joining the US military is back on the books. But based on a new directive only five senior military officials will be able to discharge service members for violating the policy. The change makes it harder for the military to remove openly gay troops. We speak to one of the most vocal critics of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Lt. Dan Choi, who this week filed papers to re-enlist after being discharged earlier this year.


- Does Opposing "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" Bolster U.S. Militarism? A Debate With Lt. Dan Choi and Queer Activist Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore

We host a debate on whether the queer rights movement should be focused on repealing the Don't Ask Don't Tell law between Lt. Dan Choi and queer anti-war activist and writer Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore. Celebrating the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell, Sycamore says, only makes progressive movements in the U.S. complicit with American wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.


- "Lawless Courts": Lack of Accountability Allows Immigration Judges to Violate Laws, Deport U.S. Citizens

A new report in the Nation magazine suggests that immigration judges who are supposed to give immigrants in deportation proceedings a fair hearing have been violating the law and even deporting US citizens. The article documents serious misconduct by immigration judges in Georgia which has the country's third-largest docket. According to the report, judges here appear more concerned about deportation quotas rather than immigrants-and citizens'-rights.
