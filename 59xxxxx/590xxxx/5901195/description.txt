PLOT

Plot:
For the first time ever, the secret agenda of the planets ruthless
Super-class is exposed in stark detail. This documentary film chronicles
how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to
establish an oppressive world government. Learn how this global oligarchy
controls the populace through drug trafficking, money laundering, staged
terror attacks, media propaganda and debt. The criminal controllers have
successfully dominated the globe and are now in the final phase of
consolidating power. Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the
globalists through their own words and documents. Worldwide tyranny isnt
coming, its here. This isnt conspiracy theory, its conspiracy
fact. The New World Order is out in the open all documented in
stunning living color. Unelected bureaucrats are establishing regional
unions under one superstate. Witness their plan for a global tax and a
cashless surveillance society in which every man, woman and child is
micro-chipped at birth. Invisible Empire will be more than just a film--
it is the culmination of years of research by Jason Bermas into the
inner-workings and most revealing public statements by the New World
Order and the most trusted stewards of their dark vision. 'Invisible Empire'
promises to unveil the long-term agenda for world control, just as
Fabled Enemies and Loose Change Final Cut forever stripped away
the facade of the official story of 9/11 and exposed the dark truth
that lies behind.
