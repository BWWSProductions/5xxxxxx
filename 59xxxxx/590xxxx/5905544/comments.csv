Did you recheck torrent in your bittorrent client?
[Sacrianna]
Need update video codecs and filters (for ex. install or update K-Lite Codec Pack http://www.codecguide.com/)"
,DarkRedoSin,2011-01-26T03:58Z,"Thanks for this,and now for-[ajroberts] you must be doing something wrong because I didn't find any corrupt files.
Also to [Sacrianna] all videos files played perfectly.I checked them all out including the ones you mentioned that didn't.
I use VLC to watch and they were all perfect.Thanks again,will be watching these episodes with pleasure!"
