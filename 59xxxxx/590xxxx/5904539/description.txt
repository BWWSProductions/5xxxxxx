"Old Dogs"

Jack's uncle, Nate, a deceitful con man, witnesses 
an arson and goes to see Jack and Dan with 
information about the people behind it. With the 
Nate as the only witness, the investigation forces 
Jack to work alongside his uncle, a man he barely 
knows or trusts.

If your a fan of the show at least DVR it and help
boost the ratings. Would be a shame to lose the
only fun, non CBS-style, cop show on TV (Burn
Notice stopped being any good after S1, so it does
not count.)

Enjoy :)
