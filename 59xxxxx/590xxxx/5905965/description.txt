It is a blu-ray rip and i have converted it to dvd format, to save you a lot of 

time, if you want to burn it to a dvd.


It is exactly the same as the other karate kid 2010 I posted, but this is converted

to dvd format.

English spoken in it, and it is texted in English when they speak chinese.

Rate and Comment!!!!
