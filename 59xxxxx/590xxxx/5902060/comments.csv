,jcas5,2010-10-22T14:28Z,Thank you for your releases they are great as always.  Could you please provide the switches you use to produce this quality? -t appletv -pbM ? 
[V],HolyRoses,2010-10-22T14:44Z,"that is the switch for this, plus metadata and catalog switches and +o 10"
,jcas5,2010-10-22T15:05Z,You always gain volume in your releases?
,jcas5,2010-10-22T15:42Z,does +o 10 gain volume?
[V],HolyRoses,2010-10-23T00:47Z,"supposed to be -o +10, early morning typos.

And yes generally.  the DD to stereo conversion generally produces a quieter track in my opinion."
,zefjan,2010-10-23T19:59Z,Awesome releases!!! Love the quality and sound on ATV. By chance you have all the Disney Pixar releases? Potentially any diamond release Disney movies? Keep up the awesome work.
,tobykuntakinte,2010-10-24T06:00Z,"hey hr can you please reUL Super Troopers (PSP, iPod, Zune) with no .zip? i really love the movie but my computer wont unzip files. thanks for all the ULs."
[V],jainmehul,2010-10-24T09:44Z,rocking HR is back with his ROCKING RIPS....
[V],HolyRoses,2010-10-26T01:04Z,"picked up an appletv 2.  seems to stream just fine.  it actually appears to download the video while playing.  so it must have a decent amount of flash ram.

video quality seems different. i can't see anyway to set the video output to 1080p like i can on the old player.

interface is a little different.  doesn't display the studio tag anymore.

for $99 seems like a decent device."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-10-26T01:30Z,"netflix interface is cool too, lets you actually play movies that aren't in your instant queue."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-10-26T03:25Z,guessing its a 8gb flash.  has 6.5gb free on my unit.
,zefjan,2010-10-26T03:50Z,Yeah very nice. Sure beats waiting for Apple to come out with a hdmi connection to get videos out of the iPad and I dont trust noosy's adapter either. Still figuring out what jail-breaking the ATV will do?
[V],HolyRoses,2010-10-26T05:42Z,"I jailbroke mine today.  PwnageTool.  At first I didn't think it worked (since nothing looked changed) but apparently it did do something, I did it 2x.  Must of worked first time as well.  To make sure it worked just try to ssh to the box.  If you can ssh to it, then it worked ;)

NitoTV is working on mods for it.
