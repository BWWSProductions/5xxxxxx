               During the Democratic Republic of the Congos seven year war,
               more then 80.000 women and girls were raped.

               Fighting the Silence tells the story of ordinary women and 
               men struggling to change their society: one that prefers to 
               lame victims rather than prosecute rapists.  Survivors tell
               of the brutality they experienced. Husbands talk of the
               pressures that led them to abandon their wives. 

               A father explains why he has given up on his daughters future.
               Soldiers and policemen share their (shocking) views about
               why rape continues to flourish in the Congo despite the war
               having officially ended four years ago.
