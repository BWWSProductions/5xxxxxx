Alex talks with intelligence officer Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer who has says that the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency failed to properly evaluate intelligence on supposed 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta. Shaffer's allegations subsequently became known as the Able Danger controversy. In September, it was reported that the Pentagon had destroyed 9,500 copies of Shaffer's book Operation Dark Heart. Shaffer currently serves as the Reserve G6 Assistant Chief of Staff, Communications and Technology of an Army Reserve division. He received his B.A. in political science and environmental studies from Wright State University in 1986.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
