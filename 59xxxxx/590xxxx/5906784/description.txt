Storyline

Terry Hoitz's past mistakes in the line of duty and Allen Gamble's reluctance to take
risks have landed them the roles of the "Other Guys", disgraced New York City police
detectives relegated to filling out paperwork for cocky hero cops Danson and Highsmith.
The mismatched duo must look past their differences when they take on a high-profile
investigation of shady capitalist David Ershon and attempt to fill the shoes of the
notoriously reckless officers they idolize.
