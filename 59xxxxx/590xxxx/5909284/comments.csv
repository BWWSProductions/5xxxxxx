,aDruid,2010-11-01T04:13Z,Would've been real nice if you had seeded it!
,mouse32_k,2010-11-05T09:29Z,"Actually, I have been seeding it since the beginning.  Recent run-ins with my ISP have created a problem though.  I've run up against the bandwidth cap a few times, so I'm still going to be seeding, but not 24/7.  If you're DLing, please don't give up.  It will just take a little longer than I expected to get it out there.  Sorry for the inconvenience."
,MakeItRainnn,2010-12-19T10:46Z,Pleaseeee seed. Im at 93.8% and need it finish it by tomorrow night. I have already seeded it past 1. I just need to finish this download!!
,vivatpb5776,2011-04-07T16:44Z,"I had a very detailed report on all 20 seasons but I guess there is a character or word limit. So, in summation, the entire .torrent is excellent. There are two seasons (7 & 12) that I would replace but other than that, very excellent. Thank you uploader."

,mouse32_k,2011-05-01T18:43Z,Thanks vivatpb5776 for the info!  I admit I didn't watch them all before I uploaded them.  This is my first .torrent upload so sorry everyone.  From now on I'll be more thorough in assuring the quality of my uploads.  Very soon I will be uploading TBs worth of TV shows and movies and the like.  As soon as I get the business class internet with no bandwidth cap.  
,Gazooo,2011-06-12T17:30Z,"Thanks a lot for this great UL!!!!....
The Video and Audio quality is super!!...
Except for seasons 7 and 12, the video is a bit less than the rest, but still very watchable.
It took me over a week DLing it day and night but i finaly got it.
You made me very happy!!...
I will seed for a while.
Thanks again Anonymous UpLoader!!...
Greetings from Gazooo."

,djm1988,2012-01-23T05:11Z,"Exelent, i need it !!, 1 question... have spanish subs?"
,gothbless,2012-04-04T14:46Z,"djm1988 ... dude, he did an amazing job getting all these together... at least what you can do is search for the subtitles!! use subdivx dot com or something like that to start with, regards! :) THanks for the one who uploaded this, amazing work! "
,jackman0,2012-05-22T23:04Z,"Most of these seasons are what I already had downloaded and thoroughly enjoyed. Aside from shortening my download time, it also means more SEEDING! Woo!"
,edula666,2012-06-21T12:10Z,"Just to add to vivatpb5776's overview of the quality etc, in season 6, eps 1-9 and 23 are ripped from a European TV channel, and have rather large hardsubs (possibly Dutch? Sorry, not great with languages). The rest of s06 are the aforementioned Hallmark rips. Still, this is an excellent post - am loving the quality so far. Thanks soooooo much :-)"
