I saw how there was no English version of Toy Story 3 anywhere so I decided to provide one myself.

Yes it is ENGLISH and ONLY ENGLISH. I dumped the image myself from a real copy here in AUS.

As you can see it's also scrubbed and I have also have stopped it wanting to update your wii console.

It works fine for me I dumped it, scrubbed it, packed it, unpacked it, burned it and played it for a while with no problems.

Just unpack the iso inside the rar and burn it slowly.(I always do 4x)

Enjoy!
