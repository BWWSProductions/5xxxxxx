,masterfaster2,2010-10-25T00:33Z,this is the crack by vovan31337
,DCCentR,2010-10-25T01:15Z,Yep
,deathtrooper30,2010-10-25T01:42Z,Badass game!
,somedude.1001,2010-10-25T07:44Z,"Goddamn, the game itself isnt even officially released yet. Nice job!"
,enduin387,2010-10-25T11:19Z,Game works and everything max at a solid 30 but the Lucas intro stutters and lags like hell and none of the cutscenes work seem to work. No intro cutscene before the first mission and nothing before the second either. As well the lighting/shadows during the first mission are busted either its illuminated or completely black. But this could all be the game and not the crack.
,alless27,2010-10-25T14:07Z,"hmm, my mouse and keyboard dont work to play. In menu they are okey. Any ideas? "

In Windows XP- Start->Run->regedit
In Windows 7/Vista- Start and write down regedit
Or you can also press WIN+R (WIN is button on keyboard next to left CTRL)"

,JesiahCarver,2010-10-25T16:01Z,I'm thinking there is an issue with the crack in the sense that there needs to be other files copied into the game directory such as intro videos and such because I'm not seeing any intro vids either... Just suddenly puts you into combat.
,JesiahCarver,2010-10-25T16:04Z,It's either missing files that need to be in the crack or it's because of the ru version thats out doesn't have the english videos.
,spenaat,2010-10-25T16:26Z,"Well, i downloaded that CLONEDVD version, changed language using regedit and yes, I have there all videos and yes, they are in English."
,MysteriousS,2010-10-25T16:54Z,"@Jug141 It means press start and type regedit into your ""search program and files"" to find the Windows Regedit program. Alternatively you can look in Local Disk C/Windows for regedit.exe 

This crack works great by the way, though I am unable to save it would appear. Anyone else with this problem?"
,APDJOKER,2010-10-25T18:00Z,"From what I have read this is what you have to do do get it into english

HOPE THIS HELPS

""start"" search ""regedit""

Computer/HKey-Local_Machine\Software\Wow6432Node\LucasArts\Star Wars The Force Unleashed 2

Edit the language from ""ru"" to ""en""

Worked for me to get the menus in English

Xbox 360 Controller for windows works for this game as well "
,APDJOKER,2010-10-25T18:06Z,"You may also find it without the \Wow6432Node\ as previously stated in your regedit file

""start"" search ""regedit""
it should look like this below:

Computer/HKey-Local_Machine\Software\LucasArts\Star Wars The Force Unleashed 2"

starting exe. (Win 7 64 bit)"
,APDJOKER,2010-10-25T19:47Z,Works fine for me  win xp    you wont see any cut scene so don't think the games gone wacky it just the way it is...
,john6425,2010-10-26T07:43Z,"AVG says it's infected? (SecuRom.dll)

Explain to me why that is?


And get the fuck out of here with that ""false positive"" shit LMAO, how come the other cracks for other games don't give ""false positives"" I got Mass effect 2, Res Evil, etc etc No ""false positives"" 


Basically, I mean let's be realistic here, we just infected our computers..."
[V],blaze69,2010-10-26T13:05Z,"@john6425

yes The SecuRom.dll File Is actually a False Positive. Don't say That Other Cracks Don't Get Flagged, Some Razor 1911 And RELOADED""s Cracks Get Flagged.. Reloaded's whysosrs.DLL File Was Flagged as A False Positive For BAtman Arkham Asylum.

Anyways Proper Crack And English Registry Fix Here
