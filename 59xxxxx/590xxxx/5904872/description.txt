Beatles for Sale is The Beatles' fourth album, released in late 1964 and produced by George Martin for Parlophone. The album marked a minor turning point in the evolution of Lennon and McCartney as lyricists, John Lennon particularly now showing interest in composing songs of a more autobiographical nature. "I'm a Loser" shows Lennon for the first time seemingly coming under the influence of Bob Dylan,[1] whom he met for the first time in New York while on tour, on 28 August 1964.[2]
No single was released in the UK from Beatles For Sale â€“ the non-album tracks â€œI Feel Fineâ€ and â€œShe's a Womanâ€ performed that role â€“ however, that coupling was followed-up in the US by â€œEight Days a Weekâ€ which became their seventh number one in March 1965.
The album hit the UK number one spot and retained that position for eleven of the 46 weeks that it spent in the Top Twenty. Beatles For Sale did not surface as a regular album in the US until 1987. In its place was â€œBeatles â€˜65â€ which featured eight songs from Beatles For Sale, plus the A and B-side of â€˜I Feel Fineâ€™ and â€˜Iâ€™ll Be Backâ€™ from the UK â€˜s â€˜A Hard Dayâ€™s Nightâ€™ album. Beatles '65 enjoyed a nine week run at the top of the US charts beginning in January 1965.
