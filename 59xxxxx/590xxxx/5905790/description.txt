NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Wall St.2

Right here we are running late again with this one.....anyway we used laps audio as it was the best out and
used the russian dvdr.
Now once again the r5 dvdr was poor by the normal standard so we think.It was way too dark and colours too
strong and also off.
Anyway we made a script to fix the colours the best we could and also made it alot brighter ..roughly + 10 on brightness
alone + we added our normal resize,white balance etc...
Now the audio we used laps audio and added the last 3 mins of audio for the credits off the original russian track to make it
complete.
We also gone for a larger file size due to the runtime of the film being over 2hrs and we wanted to keep a really nice bitrate.


Enjoy folks
