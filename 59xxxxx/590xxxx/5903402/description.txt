This is a pack containing these applications/games:

- Angry Birds Level Packs 1/2/3
- Joiku Spot Premium
- Qik Premium
- Quick Panorama Pro
- SPiN
- Tower Bloxx Deluxe 3D
- ZenBound.

The files are zipped. Use unzipping programs or click on it on Windows and press unzip. All of these are in .deb files. You use a USB to send them onto your N900 in any file, just somewhere you can find them. When you are done just press the .deb files. It will take you to Application Manager and install them only, since the games are fully on your device now. For Angry Birds map packs obviously you need Angry Birds to be downloaded and installed.

Enjoy and seed. My uploading speed isn't the greatest so I'll need it.

Yarrgh!
