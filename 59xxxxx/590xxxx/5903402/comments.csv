,xxXdareaperXxx,2011-01-15T05:32Z,"Games :
Tower Bloxx 3D - Works !
Zen Bound - Works !
Spin - Works !

Apps:
Qik Premium - Works ! 
Quick Panorama Pro - Works !
Joiku Hotspot (Tip :Add the repositories for it ) : Works ! 


I've tested and installed all of these my self . They worked fine on my N900 (PR 1.3) . I did not test Angry Bird's packs cause i already have them . The Level 4 pack can be found elsewhere on TPB , a simple search should do .

Thank you Uploader ! and thank you seeders !
