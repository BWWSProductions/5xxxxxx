The Clash - I Fought the Law [promo].VOB  



HQ rare promo music video. "I Fought the Law" is a much-covered song 
originally recorded by Sonny Curtis and The Crickets (post Buddy Holly) 
in 1959. The song was famously covered by Bobby Fuller Four, who recorded 
a more successful version of the song in 1965 after releasing an earlier, 
slightly different version on Fuller's own Exeter Record label in 1964. 
Another famous version was recorded by The Clash in 1979. This cover version 
helped gain The Clash their first taste of airplay in the States and is one 
of the best-known cover versions of the song.
