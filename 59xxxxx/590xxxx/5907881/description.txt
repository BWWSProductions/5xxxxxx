The Landlord is the story of Tyler, the unfortunate young proprietor of a demon-haunted 
apartment building. While finding tenants has never been a problem for Tyler, keeping 
them alive long enough to pay rent is. No matter how nicely Tyler asks, he cannot keep 
the demons from eating the renters (or persuade them to wait a month or two, even). 
They never listen. And why should they? They have an all-you-can-eat buffet of delicious 
human flesh and Tyler as their pet monkey. But all that might change when Tyler takes 
a liking to the newest tenant, a desperate young woman running from demons of her own.
