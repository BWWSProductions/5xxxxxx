,DiMarko,2010-10-28T21:33Z,"So, because I'm still technically a newbie to running things like this, how would I install this?"
,DiMarko,2010-11-03T22:23Z,"Soo. No one is going to help? Just need info on the steps. I know it's something along the line of mounting the game with Daemon, but I don't quite understand what the other stuff is for. And yes, yes I know I am a noob to this stuff."
,chaotic82,2010-11-05T16:13Z,"DiMarko.  Usually the steps on how to install these are in the .nfo which you open op in note pad.  Try this, I am  not sure of your operating system so it may be different, plus I haven't downloaded yet.
1. Mount/Burn ISO with Deamon tools or related software.
2. Follow the install instructions.
3. Explore the ISO from ""My Computer"" and find the folder that says crack, provided it has one.
Enjoy.
Now if there is not a cracked .exe, you will have to find one on the net."
