[T],HD-R-US,2010-10-26T11:46Z,"
Cheers, prashant22 - I'm glad you enjoyed it :o)"
,zossie,2010-11-01T14:10Z,"I agree, perfect quality, thank you very much!!!"
,Screamokid,2010-11-11T21:50Z,"I'll download but I have a few things to say about your ""Important information"" DVD players are not 420p, if you're using NTSC, it's 480p, if it's PAL, then it's 576p so both are capable of ""rendering more than 420p"". So sure enough you can't watch at 480p/576p but you can still view the movie with a DVD player. If not, then it's the actual file or the fact you're using DVD5, I'm not so sure about this."
[T],HD-R-US,2010-11-11T22:20Z,"
@Screamokid

Firstly, thank you for doing me the favour of downloading the movie - I appreciate it.

Regular DVD players cannot render Hi-Def video, full-stop, so whatever your beliefs are, if you are looking to watch this movie on one without re-encoding it, save yourself some time and bandwidth."
,nark0z,2010-11-14T13:15Z,Whoever directed this movie is retarded.
,QuinnTheOnly,2010-11-16T17:26Z,"I downloaded it and, I opened the .rar file and nothing is in there. And it says its 4 GBs."
[T],HD-R-US,2010-11-17T15:15Z,"@QuinnTheOnly

It is not a rar file - there is no rar file - it is a blu-ray/AVCHD ISO, not a DVD ISO, so WinRAR, MagicISO and alike will NOT recognise the file. You will need to extract the ISO using a late version of PowerISO or 7-Zip - this has already been explained in the torrent's notes if you read them."
,dukeNikolas,2010-11-27T20:26Z,"AWESOME quality!!!! 
Video:11/10, Audio:10/10(although ac3) !!!! 
Thanks HD-R-US for this excellent upload in such a small ammount of GB! I watched the m2ts in a Western Digital Live Media Player and the quality just rocks! The movie was not the best comedy I have seen, although...! Anyway, thanks again! Cheers!"
,XxXchickenXxX,2010-12-07T18:16Z,Please seed :) ty people ! 
,jimk16,2010-12-14T06:02Z,"Ok, a few quick questions. I have a newer i5 with 8gb ram, but my display resolution is only 720p. Will I be able to view this movie if mounted? Also if I use windows dvd maker to encode and burn this movie HOW much quality would be lost, as in would it be worth downloaded such a high quality movie if I'm just going o re encode it and burn to a normal dvd?"
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-15T00:12Z,"Hi, jimk16 - You'll have no problem viewing the movie on your computer, but you will be watching it in 720p rather than 1080p because of your monitor's limitations. If you re-encode the movie to VOB, you will still have a very high quality DVD version of it, but obviously it will not be hi-definition. I hope this helps.

liquidmonkey - read the torrent's release notes, dude..... read them. =)"
,justdoit33,2010-12-15T21:22Z,how do i just put it onto my ps3 and have it play? sorry im not tech savy any help would be appreciated.....evertime i try transfering it says it is too large to be transfered thank you much appreciated

,xmanng,2011-01-05T02:50Z,"Hi i watched this on my laptop nd the quality was awesome! but just one thing, is there a way to watch it on my PS3 without first burning it to a DVD? i was thinking about a USB(16gb free) but when i tried to copy it says not enough space!..."
,leosales,2011-01-13T18:15Z,"Is there any chance I can download subtitles in other language and attach to it? I could extract it to a pen drive and play in the BRplayer, but I was thinking of somehow putting the subs into the file and burning it to a DVD. Is it possibile?"
[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-14T06:23Z,"xmanng - Unfortunately no, because PS3's USB port only recognises drives that are formatted to FAT32, which gives a maximum usable filesize of 4Gb. Your only other option with a PS3 is to transfer/stream the movie with Media Server.

leosales - Very possible, and takes a few minutes when you know how - no re-encoding needed. Download tsMuxer, remove one unwanted subtitle, and replace it with the language of your choice. You will need to make sure the subtitles are sync'd to the movie you are adding them to. Here's a brief guide:-
http://www.bitburners.com/articles/create-avchd-discs-with-subtitles-using-tsmuxer/4047/

Contrary to the guide, I'd recommend using the Verdana font at 62 pixels, with a bottom offset of 48 pixels for movies with an aspect ratio of 4:3, and a bottom offset of 148 pixels for movies with an aspect ratio of 16:9 (or thereabouts)."
,CGN3,2011-01-16T21:43Z,"@xmanng , you can watch the movies in your ps3 you just need to copy it to your ps3 by using ps3 media server . After installing ps3 to your pc you can see hard drivers in your big screen where ps3 is connected then select the movie where that is , you can play directly but you need giga lan with the hidef videos or 3com 100 mb ethernet .
Sorry my bad but before copyin also you have to encode the movie  to ps3 way of understanding by using mkv2vob . If you dont encode subtitles it just takes 3-4 min . But if you want to hard code the subs it is taking an hour to complete in  i7 6Gb ddr3 machine on x264(slow) codec . "

,ausn9ive,2011-01-17T23:49Z,Before i download this... How can 1080p only be 4.36 GB when other movies are a lot more?
[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-18T03:45Z,"We take the original blu-ray disk, cut it into 4 pieces with a sharp knife, and spin one section of it really fast so that it gives the illusion of being a full disk. Then we take a picture of it, and upload the image.

Or something along those lines..."
,EvilCorporateWhore,2011-01-18T04:30Z,"@ausn9ive

Don't question it, just enjoy the awesomeness of it.

HD-R-US's uploads are epic. In that they are fairly small files for absolute amazing quality - by anyone's standards. And come on, burning literally cannot be made *any* easier."
,Phatbum,2011-01-19T13:42Z,"I have downloaded this after reading all comments before and Figured it would be safe enough, Imagion my disappointment when trying to watch - Its constantly jumping! I have no idea if this has happened to anyone else, or if it is my Computer settings (which i highly doubt as i have watched countless dvd rips on here b4 and have NEVER had to change settings!) If it is something i can fix please can u tell me how Without using alot of mumbo jumbo (technical computer talk) I am quite a novice when it comes to settings and  such please help if u can. If you cant then may i suggest u remove this download and try again. I have downloaded alot off here and even though im having problems, it wont deter me from downloading again. 

Thanks"
[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-19T18:58Z,Phatbum - stick with the DVD rips that you have been downloading. Your computer hardware is obviously not man enough to render 1080p video.
,xefermix,2011-01-20T23:46Z,"thanks HD-R this is really good stuff. also while this works great right off the bat in w7 mounting with  virtual clone drive I ran into a problem reading it with xp, it cannot natively understand udf 2.5 I found a driver here:
http://www.digital-digest.com/articles/Xbox_360_HD_DVD_Windows_page1.html
now it works great on xp too!
also as a note to people having trouble with computer performance playing this, STOP USING VLC! on my computer it uses at lest 2x the cpu time to play the same videos  as wmp(with codecs, ffdshow, haali)

thanks again, will seed!"
