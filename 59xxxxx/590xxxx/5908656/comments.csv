http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5908665/Dexter.S05E05.First.Blood.HDTV.XviD-FQM

Scenebalance you can shove your RAR files up your ass!!!

Anyone who uses RAR to try and compress  heavily compressed XVID video is by definition a fucking retard.

Anyone who is too fucking stupid to UNRAR after getting it from scenetime, has no business uploading here. 

You are truly fucking ignorant and I avoid your torrents like the plague."
