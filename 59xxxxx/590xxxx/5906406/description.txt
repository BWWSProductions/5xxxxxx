Hardcoded Subs for Navi Dialogue

INTENTION:
This edit aims to eliminate the extreme environmental and political overtones 
that the viewer is bashed over the head with in the original. The original 
tried to make poorly conceived political statements which were executed even 
more poorly. At the same time it attempts to clean up some poor dialogue, 
poor acting, poor pacing, and just a slew of other problems inherent 
with the film.
