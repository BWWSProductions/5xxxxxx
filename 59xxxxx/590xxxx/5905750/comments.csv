,DSIN,2010-10-23T19:15Z,"@riddlerA : thanx dude... keep rockin :D

@siddhart : he did many series (seasons) in HDTV rips like gossip girl,24, chuck, Dexter(season 4) & lost season 6 etc
just to let u know... the quality of lost 6th season wasn't much different from any other (all gr8 i mean)
& IMO he compresses the file just enuff so that it doesn't lose much quality ... so iam just happy the way he's ripping tv shows now...
