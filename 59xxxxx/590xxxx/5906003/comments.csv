,RawRanger,2010-10-26T16:51Z,"How To Install 19.10.2010:

Prepare your system before installing and activating Nero 9:

1. A user account with Administrator rights: Windows Vista/7
2. disable UAC and reboot for the changes.
3. run the installation .exe and registration/key maker applications as administrator (right-click on the icon 

for the shortcut menu and choose ""Run as administrator"") Just in case.

Deleting all old versions of Nero 10/9/8/7/6:

1. stop all running Nero applications.

2. run the Nero General CleanTool. Reboot your system.Just to be sure (not necessary, but sometimes it helps) 

you can repeat the process.

3. in the ""Program Files"" and the ""Documents and Settings"" directories in XP (or ""Users"" and ""ProgramData"" 

directories for Windows Vista/7) delete all folders containing the name ""Nero"" (use search to find them). Also 

delete your temporary files.

4. reboot the system.

Also, before installing it is best to upgrade your system's .Net and directX framework.

Minimum required:. NET Framework 3.5 ( already present in Windows 7) and DirectX 9.0c (Current version: June 

2010):

1. Update DirectX 9.0c June 2010  http://download.microsoft.com/download/8/4/A/84A35BF1-DAFE-4AE8-82AF-

AD2AE20B6B14/directx_Jun2010_redist.exe

2) update. NET Framework to version 3.5 http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/0/f/60fc5854-3cb8-4892-b6db-

bd4f42510f28/dotnetfx35.exe"
,RawRanger,2010-10-26T16:55Z,"Start the installation:

1. Start the installation of Nero Multimedia Suite 10 Platinum HD. During the installation program will ask 

you if you would like to install components not included in the install package and then will offer them to 

download for you. You are free to do so.
The program will then ask for a reboot, after which the installation continues automatically.

NOW TURN OFF THE INTERNET!!!

2. Install Nero Multimedia Suite 10 Platinum HD with key 9X03-014M-337H-H1CZ-L2KK-229X-1ZUX-LPHA

3. After installation is complete, restart the system. Do not run the program.

4. If needed, install Nero MediaHome 4 and/or Nero Move it.

When the installation asks for a key open the Nero 9.0 HQ License maker manager 5.55 BetaMaster (Run as 

administrator on Vista/7).
Check the Auto Handle Installers, select CO list of these two products, click ""Generate"" and click ""Add to 

White-List"". 
They must show up as registered in the Control Center!

5. After a successful installation of the entire Nero Suite reboot. 

Make sure the Internet is still disabled at this point!!!

Start the Nero 9.0 HQ License maker manager 5.55 BetaMaster (Run as administrator on Vista/7). 
Choose: 
Activation (Nero MediaHome 4) 
Activation (Nero move it)
DTS plug-in click Register Serial.
They must show up as registered in the Control Center.

6. Then manually add the following keys in the Control Center:

DTS Plug-In: 	KK00-5195-199K-254K-132E-9056-XC07
mp3PRO Plug-In: KC00-203X-1886-2446-051E-54C2-XC60

IMPORTANT! Unable to generate the keys for the following components:

Gracenote Plug-in
Blu-Ray Video Plug-in
Blu-Ray/HD-DVD Plug-in
Blu-Ray Disc Authoring Plug-in
Blu-Ray Disc Playback Plug-in
Move it Plug-in"
,RawRanger,2010-10-26T16:59Z,"The most important thing to do after the installation and activation process is to block all access of your 

Nero products to the Internet. Do this by means of your firewall!!!

Now it's safe to turn the internet connection back on.

And do not update the product! This will get your keys blacklisted!

If you want to get rid of the annoying registration notice, delete the file ""NOSProductRegistration.dll"" in 

the following locations:
C: \\ Program Files \\ Nero \\ Nero 10 \\ Nero BackItUp \\ OnlineServices
C: \\ Program Files \\ Nero \\ Nero 10 \\ Nero Burning ROM \\ OnlineServices
C: \\ Program Files \\ Nero \\ Nero 10 \\ Nero Express \\ OnlineServices
C: \\ Program Files \\ Nero \\ Nero 10 \\ Nero MediaHub \\ OnlineServices
C: \\ Program Files \\ Nero \\ Nero 10 \\ Nero StartSmart \\ OnlineServices
C: \\ Program Files \\ Nero \\ Nero 10 \\ Nero Vision \\ OnlineServices

and replace them with ""dummy""or empty files of the same name.

That's it! Sorry for the long post."
