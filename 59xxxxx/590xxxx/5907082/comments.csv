,kevmeister2009,2010-11-03T14:56Z,@Rugik; use file explorer in your virtual drive ware and look for a file called Eng Fix...
,BMW_318tds,2010-11-03T19:41Z,"And I also can't install mods in this game, better look for the Landwirtschafts Simulator 2011... Yes it's german, but Farming Simulator without mods, that's like a pub without beer..."

As for jpderv, use file explorer in your virtual drive ware and look for a file called Eng Fix. copy and paste it on your installed version."
