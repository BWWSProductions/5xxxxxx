,h3ll4b0y,2010-10-22T20:26Z,is this stealth patched?
,billy234,2010-10-23T04:34Z,"@h3ll4b0y ; probably not , usually the patch release the day the game hits stores, so probably next tuesday. btw games are rarely pre-patch"

,balacaxana,2010-10-24T13:46Z,"""USA & PAL (Region Free)"", works on NTSC?"
,ntfcAndy,2010-10-24T14:13Z,USA is NTSC
,Metalprofi666,2010-10-25T02:44Z,"I just finished the game. It was quite easy and very short! What the heck is happening to the games recently. They all seem too short or its just me that is playing up to 4 hours per day:P
Anyways, the game was descent 8/10"
,greenmint,2010-10-25T04:59Z,Does this also work on Asian NTSC-J?
,Nords1980,2010-10-25T07:17Z,I just finished my Download 2 hours ago and Im playing it now for 20 minutes.  It's good.  
,Nords1980,2010-10-25T07:21Z,Vaggos97  Who knows what u did.  Do you have the right layer break code?  I use Image Burn and it works no problem. (as always)  I don't know what to tell you.  I use an iso image booter for my games to work.  Since they don't work until I put that disc in after it loads.  idk what other people use.
,Nords1980,2010-10-25T07:56Z,"My last comment,   The game seems very choppy graphics-wise when the action is going down.  I dont know what the reason for that is.  But is very ugly.   Maybe the makers of the game overlooked it, Maybe I burned it at a fast speed (2x I dont think so) or maybe the copy is sketchy.  It works fine other than that issue."
,dodoSKC,2010-10-25T10:41Z,"Yeah, I agree with Nords1980. The game looks absolutely fantastic but the moment you start chopping people with a lightsaber FPS goes to hell. It's like the frame freezes for a milisecond every time you hit someone with a saber."
,Feesty,2010-10-26T10:03Z,"everything seems to run fine for me apart from i seem to getting this weiord kinda bug where the floor is all is all pixelated and in a rainbow of colours, has anyone else encountered this problem?
my Rig is AMD5600 3gb ddr2, Geforce 220gt. all my drivers are up to date."
,Feesty,2010-10-26T10:26Z,other than this bug i have no frame problems no framerate issues or anything jus cant fix this colour of the floor problem.
,bulacha2,2010-10-26T13:53Z,"Wooow....In my house i have 540 seeds...

and a conection of 12.670KBP's.....

but i just get  conection with 59 or 66 seeds...

I don't understand much about torrent.....

,baaasen,2010-10-27T21:12Z,"good game but to short, finnished it in less than 6 hours. the graphics looks just fine for me. thanks for the up, keep up the good work."
,Epic_win,2010-10-28T22:45Z,"""It's like the frame freezes for a milisecond every time you hit someone with a saber.""

Dude, did you ever play the first one?  That's part of the game."
,Entreri11,2010-10-29T01:31Z,hey vaggos97 you should do a pot calibration on your dvd drive. If you dont know what that is then look up a tutorial for it. It will fix most disc unreadable errors.
,Sonicman12,2010-10-29T02:59Z,Does not work on jtag get black screen
,Sonicman12,2010-10-29T03:10Z,Does not work on jtag jasper

,thegamechanger,2010-11-01T22:15Z,"I have a jasper...I don't know if it was j-tagged, but it is not working...neither is castlevania and gothic 4, they show the pic on the screen but when i try to play it, it says it is unreadable. I write w/ layerbreaker and 1x speed. vanquish worked fine though. Did they change something w/ the new games to stop the jaspers at microsoft? "
,filofatty62,2010-11-05T22:10Z,"does this torrent work cos i dont want to use my internet usage on this if it doesnt and also i was looking at some comments and ppl are sayin there burnin it with imgburn at 2x u have a much better chance of successfully burning it at 2.4x or 4x it says on imgburn ""recommended write speed 2.4x 4x"" i only use 2.4x and it always workd  "
,marty584,2010-11-07T12:02Z,"I too am getting the disk unreadable error.

Burned as I normally do.

Checked it on abgx360 and patched to ss2 burned in clonecd after checking layer break
