NEW RULE: Show that gets "-" (negative) rating is on the way out. 
          Let me be clear: 480p is BETTER than XviD - but LESS than half in size. 
          480p has BIGGER frame-size ("picture" size) than 272p MORE THAN TWICE 
          (2.16 times) - but file-size is bigger just by silly 10% (15 MB approx.).
          Also, 480p has by ONE THIRD BIGGER frame-size than XviD.
          So - new rule: any complaints came from your head only.
          IF you are frustrated with your life or mentally incapacitated - vent someplace
          else out. My files are perfect - in given category.
          IF you do not think so - here's the deal: Turn around and go away. Forever.
          SUB-RULE: Normal people! Do not let be overrunned by idiots! Not again-
          Do not allow to be over-voiced. Again.
          IF you like my encodings, you CAN say so - by Rating and by Thanking.
          
          And yes - it is matter of vanity. That's me. Live with that.
