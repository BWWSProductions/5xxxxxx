Btw: the text doesn't look clear on my computer, any suggestions?"
,the_m11x,2010-10-21T18:33Z,"It seems like a good quality guide. I used Adobe Reader 9.4 (free from Adobe) to quickly glance it over. I wouldn't use it to read the guide though. It's roughly 250 pages, so maybe a quick run to a printing shop would help. There are pictures, so I would recommend printing in color. Enjoy!"
,dlr1988,2010-10-21T18:54Z,is this legit? i'm currently downloading one which has 278mb...
,keedoo,2010-10-21T20:10Z,Legit?? Legit means you spent money on to own it.
,Darkshire,2010-10-21T23:10Z,Next time don't reduce the size so much. It severely degraded the quality. Makes it hard on the eyes. Cheers.
,Klimt_Westwood,2010-10-22T03:06Z,This is not my scan. I'm just passing on what I found on some forum (and it is 240 megs unrared). The quality isn't great but it's quite legible when blown to more than 150% and I found it looks *much* clearer in Foxit (a free PDF reader) than in Adobe. The difference might help some people. Thanks for seeding!

Legit in the pirating community means if the file contains a virus and isn't complete rubbish. It's obvious he wasn't talking about owning it.

Thanks for this upload."
,Klimt_Westwood,2010-10-22T12:04Z,Does anyone have the game manual? I would like to do my reading in order.
,1994GiOVANNi2,2010-10-22T12:05Z,lol i stole my guide from gamestop :]
,sdnl1j2,2010-10-22T22:53Z,"@Klimt_Westwood 

you can download the manual from steam web site."
,Klimt_Westwood,2010-10-23T02:22Z,It never even occured to me to download the manual from Steam. Thanks! Now a bit of light reading while waiting for the update... let's say no. 6... which will require starting a new game... and I can start to play properly prepared. :)
,nikrusty,2010-10-23T05:52Z,Coolest...bless u!
,mcordell,2010-10-23T23:41Z,"What great quality seeders! 1.7 MB/s, finished 53 seconds :D.  Great guide!

Just one complaint, you need to view it at 125% to be able to read it, but no problem.  Thanks!"
,k-line,2010-10-24T01:14Z,"yes open it with Foxit.
Acrobat 9 freezes while navigating this file in my computer. But using Foxit the document looks better and there's no no freezing."
,RhymesMatter,2010-10-24T11:53Z,"@1994GiOVANNi2
hahahah man the way you said was so funny! :D
Well we actually all stole it one way or the other so cheers to you that you did it directly from gamestop :) Btw 
@Klimt_Westwood 
Thanks for sharing dude!Quality is the same as PRIMA Arcania guide which was a bit nasty but it's eligible and most of all REALLY Helpful so cheers!"
,storm919,2010-10-24T14:21Z,OMG! 57 SEEDS 1 PEER EPIC!!!!
,storm919,2010-10-24T14:22Z,OMG! 55 SEEDS / 2 PEERS EPIC!! Good Job ! Thanks for uploading :)
,AlexRmF,2010-10-24T17:31Z,"Klimt_Westwood - thanks for the recommendation about using the foxit reader, it has a waaaay better quality than adobe at least when reading this guide"
,chris886,2010-10-29T00:24Z,Foxit does view this much clearer.  Except neither foxit or Adobe allow me to interact with it.  I can't click on menu's to skip around the document. WTF?
,Crowded28,2010-10-29T05:03Z,"im having trouble getting the file after download completes, have rar and multiple pdf programs but its not picking up anything, any tips"
,AcidGlow,2010-11-07T15:48Z,"Or you can go and download 5 times smaller size and about 5 times clearer primaguide at: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5932741/Fallout_New_Vegas_Official_PDF_eGuide_-iNFERNO

40 odd megabytes a lot clearer than this copy and besides the menu works as it should."
,fleischi93,2010-11-12T00:03Z,"Thank you so much mate, I pre-ordered that shit (it's not in stores yet in my country) and now I can get it for free :)"
,Jangles90,2010-12-05T06:23Z,"I used to download these pdfs but seeing as I get the games for free, i might as well buy the guides at the very least.  Also, having a hard copy is 10 million times better than these pdfs.  Easier to read and easier to navigate through....not to mention the shiny pages and pictures :P"
,kakka66,2010-12-13T10:34Z,Bought the game but saved a good money here. Thanks for the torrent!
,mcgra6n3ahan,2011-02-22T20:15Z,there's a better quality guide out there that is much easier to navigate and open (no freezing)
,Hummiel,2011-08-17T17:28Z,"That upload is a real cat babe, youre the high-roller (lawl)

Nice one, thanks."
