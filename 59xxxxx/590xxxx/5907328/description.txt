.: Plot :.

No Heroics is set in modern-day Britain, in a world similar to ours but "with one small difference: there are superheroes." The superheroes of the world (colloquially referred to as "capes") are primarily modelled after those of the Golden Age of Comic Books, usually clad in brightly coloured outfits consisting of skin-tight materials such as Lycra or Spandex. The presence of superheroes in the world is commonplace, arriving not only to save people or avert disaster but also carrying out everyday tasks such as grocery shopping or taking a smoke break, all while in full costume. Other aspects of society relating to superheroes include:
Sidekick taxes - all superheroes have to pay sidekick taxes even if they choose not to have a sidekick, these taxes are to compensate those affected when a sidekick makes a mistake such as blowing up a post office.
The SPA - the Super Powers Authority deals with abuse of powers cases, dealing out punishments including community service, such as mentoring an unruly sidekick.
Anti-cape leagues - parallel to neo-Nazi groups in the real world, anti-cape groups (such as the Cape Haters of Great Britain) are prejudiced against superheroes and tell "capeist" jokes, and sometimes go around "cape-bashing".
The Fortress - the bar of choice for the protagonists where most of the show takes place, with three fundamental rules: "No Masks, No Powers and No Heroics".
A superhero academy exists where the capes are trained.
Cape rape - a term similar to Date rape, referring to superhero rapists.
The Stronghold - the supervillain equivalent of The Fortress. A place for the villains to meet and show their battle and torture scars from their run-ins with heroes.
