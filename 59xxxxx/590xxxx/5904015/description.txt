1989 Here Come the Snakes    CD  China WOLCD 1013 

Green on Red were an American rock band, formed in the Tucson, Arizona punk scene, but based for most of its career in Los Angeles, California, where it was loosely associated with the Paisley Underground. Earlier records have the wide-screen psychedelic sound of first-wave desert rock, while later releases tended more towards traditional Country rock.

I didn't expect to spend to much time with this, but actually I played it for about two days straight. Sure once the newness worth off, it didn't quite thrill me as much but I like it all the same. Things start off in a kind of rockin' Stones style, which is o.k. but I have to admit I like the more country rock flavored sounds which recall Highway  61 Dylan, Dream Syndicate, Meat Puppets, Neil Young and did I say the Rolling Stones already? Not bad.
