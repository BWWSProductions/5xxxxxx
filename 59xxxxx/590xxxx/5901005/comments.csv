,nikoHD,2010-10-21T14:00Z,"Thanks 20/40 when you can fit it in your schedule can you upload season 1 and 2 of joey http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375355/. I found a good source
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4630406/Joey.Season.01-Seriemesteren.
 Let me know if you can."
,lilars26,2010-10-21T14:21Z,Thanks 20-40.
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-21T14:45Z,"Same request was placed few months ago, by htctouch - and declined for simple reason: Few really small encodings already exist. Link for Season 1. was found and given. 66 MB per episode, and htctouch said that quality is good- I do just season packs of my already existing encodes."
,jon4fun,2010-10-21T18:09Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encodes/upload.

Cheers
Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-21T18:22Z,Modern Family is in.fucking.credible.
,htctouch,2010-10-21T19:07Z,"yup Joey in tht 66 mb rip were quite gud accordin to size wid .mkv containr . i wish my speed could b high so i can also do a lil bit of uploading .but damn this slow speed.

[V],twentyforty,2010-10-21T22:26Z,"Nope - it's ugly and terrible, piece of shit...

That is the opinion of our perpetual idiot: ""-1"" MORON was here."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-21T22:33Z,"... BTW... this pack was downloaded 184 times and I see 4 (FOUR) thanks and -1. I have ratio 82/1.

So - next week I would not encode Cougar nor Modern eF. So be it."

,saurabh1992,2010-10-22T07:52Z,hey wat time r u gonna do 'the big bang theory'???
,skillet92,2010-10-22T08:01Z,"pls don take modern family out of your schedule!!

pls!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-22T10:11Z,"NEW RULE: Show that gets ""-"" (negative) rating is on the way out. 
          Let me be clear: 480p is BETTER than XviD - but LESS than half in size. 
          480p has BIGGER frame-size (""picture"" size) than 272p MORE THAN TWICE 
          (2.16 times) - but file-size is bigger just by silly 10% (15 MB approx.).
          So - new rule: any complaints came from your head only.
          IF you are frustrated with your life or mentally incapacitated - vent someplace
          else out. My files are perfect - in given category.
          IF you do not think so - here's the deal: Turn around and go away. Forever.
          SUB-RULE: Normal people! Do not let be overruled by idiots! Not again-
          Do not allow to be over-voiced. Again.
          IF you like my encodings, you CAN say so - by Rating and by Thanking.

          And yes - it is matter of vanity. That's me. Live with that."
,azrielle,2010-10-22T12:27Z,"I have appreciated your encoding of Hellcats, Lost Girl, Nikita, Rizzoli & Isles, Covert Affairs, NCIS, Outlaw, Rubicon, Warehouse 13, No Ordinary Family, SVU, Smallville, Glee, and now Terriers.  Wish you'd ""smallicize"" the existing iCarly downloads for the current season (or publish how I could do it--I am still using Gordian Knot and XVID for DVD Rentals).  What happened to Undercovers?  This is my blanket thanks for your efforts, btw.  In the category of impossible requests--the epic comedy Americathon, and the incurably romantic Invitation To The Wedding (Ralph Richardson's last movie).  Again thanks."
,azrielle,2010-10-22T12:43Z,"Addendum:  Gordian knot was what I WAS using until my desktop system HDD went into defib.  The economy forces me to use my 2GB eMachine netbook that I got with my meager tax refund as my one and only.  Viewing is 1024 x 600 using VLC.  Considering that my desktop was home-built, circa 2003, with XP1700, and that the Atom N270 has almost identical benchmarks, I haven't found this to be as much as a problem as others might."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-22T14:18Z,"@azrielle: Thanks for your writing. Quite frankly, I would never like tweeter/text-messaging and by that debilitated language most people use here - and your words act as refreshment for my sour brain...

Regarding both of your requests -  unfortunately, you're right - both movies have been gone in filmographfic segments of our past and myriad of movie databases - only as obituary to their existence and glory of their time.

Thank you for thanking, by the way, even if you've used past tense (""I have appreciated"").

Regarding the playback, I never understood why some other people, on slow hardware use slowest software possible. It is illogical, right?

People with slower hardware and in omnipresent Windows  MUST use CoreAVC and Divx 1.0 in combination with WMP or MediaPlayer Classic simply because - CPU consumption is almost 6.4 TIMES lower than one of VLC. Even worse, prevalent stupidity almost direct people toward crap as K-Lite or ddshow filters from CCCP codec pack - what is utter rubbish. Shooting their own leg - and have something to bitch about later.

Thanks again."
