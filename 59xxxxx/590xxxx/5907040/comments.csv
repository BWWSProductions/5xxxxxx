,aldrinstryder,2010-10-25T11:35Z,50 episodes in just 1.39 gb?

,fakebest,2010-11-07T21:27Z,http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/45691/legend-of-bruce-lee-the/ and it confirms that lionsgate made this 3 hour compilation edit from the 50 episode series.  I am disappointed by this I wish they would release the whole series dubbed in english or at least some one release english subtitles for all 50 episodes. the uploader has a x264 HD version of this which is 3.93 gb but way better quality and has been on here for longer so it has way more seeders.
,spen007,2011-07-17T16:08Z,Not bad at all! Thank you!
,kiwilove007,2012-02-24T22:32Z,"I am recording this off the TV now, currently it is at Part 19, finishing in mid-April. I put 3 parts onto one DVD. (It is of DVD quality and is not HD - this is the way it is screened here...)  I would be happy to upload it here - but I don't have much uploading capability and I haven't uploaded anything here before... so I don't know how to start? It has English hardcoded subs, with Chinese Mandarin dialogue. Overall I rate the series as being pretty good... some parts are slow -- drag but that is to be expected...
I can't see 50 x 45 mins being edited down to 3 hours being any good - sure, there are whole parts of this presentation that can be edited out, but still - many worthwhile bits have to be omitted"
