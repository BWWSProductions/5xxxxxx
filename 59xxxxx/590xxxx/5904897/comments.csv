,2obsqr,2010-10-23T21:49Z,Nice surprise.  Logged in to get a copy of live 'thunderstruck' and I see you're back.  Thanks.  Saw BBGabor in Montreal backing the Clash at Theatre St. Denis and Robin Lane in Boston.  Thanks for the memories.  Forgot my login so had to create another.

[V],80zforever,2010-10-24T09:46Z,"steevo-be-thy-name, to answer your question, some of these bands had local cults or in other words were known in their own backyard, so not even all over the US. 

What I intended by starting these series was to give people the chance to re-discover this music and go beyond the mainstream 80s we all know and experience new ""old"" music.

By the way thanks to everyone for the comments. It's great to see old buddies around!"

Looking for the second ""The Other Ones"" album: Learning to Walk

Also...Ecstasy by Torch Song.  This was William Orbits second album after the excellent Wish Thing!"

,Crakktastical,2010-11-10T23:14Z,"I LOVE the Sue Saad and The Next album!    I've been looking for this for many years.   

Any chance you could upload this as a CD quality 320kbps torrent?   I'd be forever grateful."
[V],80zforever,2010-11-12T22:11Z,"Crakktastical, Sue Saad was a vinyl rip I did a while back and I don't have the vinyl record anymore. So this is the only copy available on my HD. sorry man. "
,Crakktastical,2010-11-17T22:49Z,"Understood - I truly appreeciate the Sue Saad, its no exageration when I say I've been looking for this for many years.  And the Jack Green upload was FANTASTIC - I've been listening non-stop - Thanks again!"
