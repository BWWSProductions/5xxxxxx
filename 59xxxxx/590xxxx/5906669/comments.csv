,LiquidKill,2010-10-24T02:29Z,My seedbox wont work here lately. So you get my slow upload speeds of 80k/sec :(
,deadlyvirus,2010-10-24T09:17Z,"Dude, thnx SOOOO much. Been waiting for this since DJ Hero 2 came out. Get the rest of those tracks though, yeah?"
,Kotjze,2010-10-25T10:45Z,thanks! looking forward to the unlocked tracks aswell :)
,Kotjze,2010-10-25T23:20Z,"Hm... Some of the tracks have weird skips in them. the Bad Romance remix has a really noticeable skip somewhere between the start and halfway, and the American Boy remix has a little skip, but not too noticeable. Haven't listened to them all, so I don't know if others have the skips."
,Linkyzor,2010-10-26T02:48Z,"Yes, this is very good quality but some of the tracks do have clipping/skipping issues.  There is an epic part in track 53 and the song clips right in the middle of it :( Still a worthy upload though I guess.  Thanks."
,Kotjze,2010-10-26T03:24Z,"Yeah, the skips aren't that bad, and it's not like anyone else has ripped this yet. So it's still awesome! :)"
,chooray,2010-10-26T20:14Z,Thanks for this!
,totsuko,2010-10-27T09:27Z,"once again amazing mixes!!

great job releasing it mate!

can't wait for more!"
,LiquidKill,2010-10-27T23:27Z,"Yeah I notcied that some of the songs have a few little tiny skips in them. I have only noticed it in around 3 song(I did not listen to all the songs)

I opened up one of the songs(Bad Romance Mix) with the skips and tried to fix it up, didnt work. Would have to redo the whole song.

Oh well. Better then nothing.

Someone else will eventually realease another version.

,little_horn_is_born,2011-04-11T23:18Z,"a real half ass job. i dont dout it took you 10 hours to do but how many of those hours were you watching tv while you just let party mode do all the work. the audio sucks next time use a digital audio cable and record all the tracks. reverb, scratchy bass. and before you say ""oh well i would like to see you do better"" i will tell you now i am going to do better!"
,reduxx,2011-10-08T00:59Z,Awesome work. Thanks LiquidKill!
