Late Night With Conan O'Brien - Thunder's Vol 1



YAY! FRESH HOT COCO!

I'm starting to upload my Conan collection, in the hopes it will get some of you to start uploading yours.  There's wayyyy too many episodes that just can't be found on bittorrent sites.

I've included lists of the episodes that've been uploaded to Demonoid so far, and the episodes I have yet to upload. I may just hold the other volumes hostage, though, until I see some more users uploading unavailable episodes.

PLEASE PEOPLE, START SHARING YOUR CONAN!  Dig through those stacks of backup discs and old hard drives, VHS tapes and laserdiscs  ;) , and give us some fresh Conesy-Wonesy to enjoy, or these pre-2004 episodes I have may never see the light of day:

PLEASE SEED, so that future generations can enjoy the show that introduced us to Coco.

There's a ton of other Conan episodes on Demonoid, as I've listed in one of these text file, mostly uploaded by users TBKA and CAPTAINSOLO.  I'd encourage anyone more adept at uploading torrents to share them here so that the filesharing world at large can enjoy. 

Thanks in advance to all that seed, and SPECIAL THANKS to those who upload their own Conan episodes. (Hint, hint. This means you.)
