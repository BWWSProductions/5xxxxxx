A = 10
m = 10
Super funny! Thank you!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-24T18:07Z,"@the_mind: Yes, I want to be praised.  It is - as I said. ""prefect encoding by given size"".

There is nothing better, and if there was, you'll share that with us, right?

And, fucker, you still haven't read - and I bet you can't handle:
...""IF you are frustrated with your life or mentally incapacitated - 
          vent someplace else out. My files are perfect - in given category.
          IF you do not think so - here's the deal: Turn around and go away. Forever.""

Now, piss-off and be quick. QUICK! Got that? 
Only morons as you come back to vent out. I vent on my way out."

,Royaltee,2010-10-25T17:23Z,@the_mind dude i dot know what ur talking about. the movie is perfect. maybe you should re download or something and figure out where YOU fucked up at. and you shouldn't complain about something that you didn't have to pay for.
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-25T18:17Z,"@the_mind: LMAO: ...""to teach you lessons"".
