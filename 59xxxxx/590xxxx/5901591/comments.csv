,fillinthisspace,2010-11-17T05:25Z,"It seems the 720p thing is still hard for people to understand.

1280x720 are the standard 16:9 dimensions. Other resolutions such as 1280x544 listed as 720p encodes are still 720p encodes but the source no doubt has a different aspect ratio such as 2.35. Therefore the 1280x720 rip would only use around 544 lines for the actual video and the rest would be encoded black bars top and bottom.
If you crop the back bars and only encode the video it's still the same resolution as the original 720p content which is why it's labelled 720p. Calling it 544p would be confusing as it's not a standard. You can take it as read a 720p 1280x544 encode is still a 720p encode, only with the black bars cropped."
,fillinthisspace,2010-11-17T05:40Z,"By the way, according to IMDB this movie has a 1.85 aspect ratio. 1280x720 is 1.77. As all the encodes I've seen are 1280x720 I assume the BluRay version was released with a 1.77 aspect ratio, while the original aspect ratio would have been around 1280x688. It seems the disc was released with a small amount of the picture cropped from each side to eliminate the need for 16 lines of black bars top and bottom.
Do the same with a 2.35 aspect ratio movie to make it ""720p"" though and you'd have to crop about 33% of the picture from the sides. Better to keep it a ""1280x544 cropped 720p"" encode than to make it ""actually 720p""."
