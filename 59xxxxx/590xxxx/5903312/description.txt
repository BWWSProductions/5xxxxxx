This is a compilation of the best and worst memes of the internet! It fills up six discs and it is in m4a format for easy use with itunes, or a Nintendo DSi.

I can not list what is here because I am lazy and it is too damn early in the morning. But there are over 100+ sound clips and songs in this file and it covers ALMOST every single meme from All Your base to Bed Intruder to Boxxy to Jessie Slaughter to stuff I can't even tell you about because it would get me in trouble with copyright holders.

But yeah. The internet in a torrent file. Literally.

The file structure is like this.

The Internet Is Terrible (5 sub folders - One for each disc.)
Pictures (Includes the rules of the Internet and stuff.)
Lobster Cat's Secret Stash (A B-Side disc with ridiculous covers and stuff I didn't put in the main five discs.)

This is NSFW, by the way. It contains profanity, psychological nudity, and implied horribleness.

Even popular stuff like Ask A Ninja, Foamy, Red VS Blue, and Homestar Runner are represented here. There's some Parry Gripp, Auto-Tune The News, and Lonely Island in here.

It's full of internets.

This thing is about 743 MB. Please help me seed it!
