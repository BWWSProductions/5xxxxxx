,2012637,2011-03-05T08:55Z,"I'm just wondering, I thought this was a 35gig+ movie on retail copies? How did this (assuming it full works) pull off less than 8 gigs?

Please reply, Thanks."
,SynapsisXXXX,2011-03-05T10:04Z,"2012637 - the bluray version has 30 mbps or more bitrate.... whereas these rips has a bitrate of around 5.5 mbps, keeping the resolution constant... hence reduction in size. "

,stark13,2011-10-10T16:32Z,has this rip got black bars above and below or does it fill the entire 16:9 hd tv screen??????
,zorn1,2011-11-11T09:20Z,"@stark13: 1.78 : 1 is the same as 16 : 9.

16/9 = 1.777... which is rounded off to 1.78.

1.78 = 1.78/1 which is written as 1.78 : 1."
,EvilCorporateWhore,2011-12-15T19:02Z,"Amazing quality, thank you. :)"
,ParasiteX,2011-12-26T15:55Z,Quality is grainy and full of small artifacts. Plus the entire video aspect has been cut down and scaled up to fit 16:9. Overall a shitty release.
,rubira,2012-01-26T00:15Z,@ParasiteX Totally agree! The constrast isnÂ´t good either
,julien3112,2012-06-26T21:14Z,Worst quality ever for a rip this big!
