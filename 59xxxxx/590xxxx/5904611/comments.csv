,Angookie,2011-02-09T05:19Z,"THERES NO VIRUS!!!!!!!!!!! Just because your crappy anti-virus software says theres a virus doenst mean your computer is getting infected.

KEYGENS and CRACKS have changed bits in their programming, most of the time matches virus signatures.

if your downloading torrent software, then its not a virus

if you visit a porn website, then its a virus

keygens especially use code that matches virus signatures to generate keys, its normal, theres no way to hide it

if your using mcaffe or norton, then your comptuer is infected from those programs

get MSE or NOD32 and get smarter"
