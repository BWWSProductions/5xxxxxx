,wildcat469er,2011-10-10T05:32Z,Thank you for using avi format.  My Blu Ray player and my DVD player will play this format.  mkv is not the greatest format.  Maybe instead of complaining ThisSiteRocks could just convert the files to mkv.  Maybe they should start uploading if they are going to be so critical
