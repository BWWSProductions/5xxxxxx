Tonight's Show: Election Myths (FBN @ 9pm ET)

On my FBN show tonight @ 9pm ET: Republicans are excited about this year's midterm election.  If they re-take the House, will things change in Washington?   Or are American elections more like the song by The Who: â€œWonâ€™t Get Fooled Again?â€ The relevant lyric: â€œMeet the new boss, same as the old boss.â€  Reason editor Matt Welch thinks so.

Republicans say they will shrink government and Democrats say they are "pro-choice" ... but those are myths. Under Reagan, Nixon, Bush, the size and cost of government grew. Karl Rove will join the program to defend Republicans. And while Democrats are "pro-choice" on abortion, they're anything but pro-choice when it comes to education, wages, and other policy areas. I'll confront Democratic strategist Joe Trippi about that.

Author Angelo Codevilla argues that whoever gets elected will soon act like a â€œruling classâ€. They will just grow the government and take more of our money.  The public, he says, puts up with it, much like a frog will slowly boil if you it in gradually heated water.  Weâ€™ll have a frog and a pot of boiling water in studio.    Will the frog jump out?
