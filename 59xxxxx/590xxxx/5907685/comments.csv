,smasudi,2010-10-24T17:04Z,thanks buddy...this was my req.will comment about the quality after i download..thanks +1
[V],prashant22,2010-10-24T18:32Z,"@mzk57
peers means exactly what u wrote...and 3(10) under peers coloums means that out of 10 peers their r 3 peers which r helping u download...means the 3 peers have some part of the file which u dont have and u r downloading from them...

the 0(1) under seed coloumn means that their is only 1 seed bt 0 indicates that it is nt active at ur client..means u r nt able to download from that particular seed...although the reason for geeting a speed of 28kbps is that their must be some peers with some percentage of downloaded file with them and helping u download...

for ques 3 ans is no...

btw did u downloaded love actually??if nt then download..i think u always miss my top quality uploads...or m i wrong??"
,DSIN,2010-10-24T19:09Z,"gr8 movie & iam sure the quality will be gr8 too....

I dont know why info of your torrent says - Audio 48kbps. Audio is really nice and overall quality is excellent. Keep up the great work buddy. 
Not downloading Rocky series. Thanks for Wall-e and inside man.
Thanks a lot."
