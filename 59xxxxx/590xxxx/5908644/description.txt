Clean Scene Releases    http://bitxtre.me/

This release may have "rar files", thats how they are uploaded to "top sites" if and when a "scene" group upload to those top sites the files that are originally "spread" to other "top sites" aka "affill sites" can and do make there way to p2p (like here on TPB). 

If You need more help understanding the scene Google it :) 


Most of my uploads are rars if you dont want the torrent dont comment or download simple as that.
