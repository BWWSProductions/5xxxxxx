Fall Out New Vegas

1. Emulate the ISO with Magic Disk(suggested)
2. Install the Game
3. Open the ISO and locate the folder named skidrow
4. Copy both exe files named FalloutNV.exe & 

FalloutNVLauncher.exe to the game installation 

folder. C\program & files\game directory name
and copy and paste & replace when asked.

Play the game. That easy. 

After the game installs, but before you crack it, 

it will try to update your Visual C ++ & Direct X. 

LET IT. If no updates are needed you will get a 

error sign and a red x. This is ok. Simply close 

and play after you crack it. I have video install 

tutorials on my you||tube account
(see the read me file for url)


This is another fine release by the SKIDROW crew
