,FappingToaster,2010-10-28T06:10Z,"I'm getting the same steam error as violentretardman. I've extracted the dll you gave to autokill117 to the game folder, copied both exe files to the game folder, and installed c++ and direct x. My concern is the steam error when i try to open the game and when i try and open the exe it says I'm missing a steam dll. Should i uninstall steam? I've tried playing the game through steam but it says it's an invalid mod or something. Sorry i have little experience with torrenting and steam lol"

[T],GWpirateGW,2010-10-31T08:19Z,"for everyone with STEAM ERROR APPLICATION LOAD ERROR 5:0000065434  issues. I searched for 3 hours. Best fix I found was to download & run a reg cleaner. C Cleaner is one that I use. Clean and repair the registry,

1. uninstall the game(all files and folder and crack)
2. google & download ccleaner.
3. run fix registry. 
4. run it 3x total(i usually find crap 1st 2x)
5. restart pc
6. proceed to install the game.
7. hope like hell that works for you.

sorry the game is still new, not alot of fixes yet."

,Cqt,2010-11-03T19:41Z,"I was a little put off by the .bat file, but change the extension to a .txt and it's legit.

Did a virus scan with AVG and MalwareBytes, everything checks out, and the game installed correctly, so this is legit.

Cheers to the uploader."
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2010-11-03T23:24Z,"Ok, so this torrent worked fine for me on the very first try. Well worth the 8 hours it took to download, obviously. I should also let people know that I am not new to this so it was really pretty easy to install and crack the game.

Anyway, I didn't need STEAM for anything. It was installed at one time on my computer but is not anymore. Didn't need it though. I am happy to report that my 2 year old computer can run this game on medium settings with no difficulties. (besides the bethesda-esk split second new region load glitches lol)

Here are the specs for my computer, in case anyone is doubting they can even run it. 
MEDIUM GRAPHICS SETTINGS

Ati radion HD3200 Graphics card (oddly enough its not one of the supported models under requirements, so have faith here)

Amd Phenom X4 9100e Quad core processor

4 Gb of ram

Hope this helps at least a few people. With all of the problems posted for this game, its rediculous that it may just be installer errors. MAKE SURE YOU GUYS GET THE C++ AND DIRECT X 9 FILES WHEN PROMPTED.

Thanks for the upload GW."

After i've installed the game, i tried to run it. It crashes after the first image in the game - beggining credits. After they try and fade into the second one, where you already can see the pointer, it crashes to the dektop. No errors popping out, it just closes itself. I've downloaded all the updates and tried each possible fix out there, i've cleaned my PC with CCleaner and nothing works. My specs:

Ati Radeon 5770 (no OC)

AMD Athlon 64 x2 7750 (also no OC, 2x 2,7 GHz)

4 gb DDR3 dual channel

I've mounted the image with Daemon tools during the installation.

DirectX and Visual C++ are both updated."

Here's what to do: 
1.install Utorrent/bitorrent client
2.install poweriso at http://www.poweriso.com/download.htm
3. download this torrent file and open it with your torrent client
4.download the files(there whould be a readme and a 6.3Gb file, 2 files total) into your downloads folder(windows)
5. create a empty fallout folder in your download folder.
6. open the 6.25gb file with poweriso and extract everything to the fallout folder, leaving the stuff u got the extract from alone
7. there should be many files in the fallout folder, just click the ""setup"" file and open.
8. install into whatever drive C drive for me
9.THIS IS IMPORTANT I ALMOST FORGOT TO DO THIS AND WAS GONNA SCRAP THIS TORRENT,Copy both exe files named FalloutNV.exe & 

FalloutNVLauncher.exe from the fallout folder in your downloads folder to the game installation 

folder. C\program & files\game directory name
and copy and paste & replace when asked.

10.now run the launcher replaced launcher to start. oh and leave the 2 files(iso file and readme) you torrented originally in your download folder. ENJOY 7-6-2011"
