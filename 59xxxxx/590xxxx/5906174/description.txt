An Introduction to Syd Barrett is a 'best of' compilation featuring the work of Syd Barrett spanning the period 1967â€“1970, including both material written during his time with Pink Floyd and his post-band solo career. The album will be released in the UK and Europe on October 4, 2010, with an, as yet, unknown release date for the rest of the world. The album features a series of new remasters and remixes, apparently all overseen by Pink Floyd's David Gilmour. The cover art, featuring various images relating to songs contained within the album, was designed and created by long-term Pink Floyd conceptual artist Storm Thorgerson. It has been announced that an extra track for CD and itunes buyers will be the previously-unreleased 20-minute long instrumental Rhamadan.
