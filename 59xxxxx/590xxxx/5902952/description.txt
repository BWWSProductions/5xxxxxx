U2 - I Will Follow [Old Grey Whistle Test 1981].VOB 



HQ rare "Old Grey Whistle Test" performance music video. "I Will Follow" 
is a song by rock band U2. It is the opening track from their debut album, 
Boy, and it was released as the album's second single, in October 1980. 
Bono wrote "I Will Follow" three weeks before U2 began recording Boy. 
U2 singer Bono has said that he wrote the song from his mother's perspective 
and that it was about the unconditional love a mother has for her child. 
His mother died following her own father's funeral when Bono was fourteen, 
which the singer says plunged him into emotional turmoil for the next few years.
