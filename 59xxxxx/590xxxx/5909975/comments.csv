then take your 99.9% assurance and report me.  When you see that my account still has the ""trusted"" status after you report me, then you can look like the Jackass as you enjoy the Jackass 3d I uploaded. Enjoy now Jackass. It is real, otherwise I would not be able to keep my trusted status and probably lose my account as well. So go, I challenge you, report me. Cause when they do nothing, cause I upload only real stuff, you will be like man, GWPirateGW was right, I made a Jackass of myself on TPB.=D"

np guys. I know it is not the best, but with all the fakes, I was forced to try and provide you with something real. If only media players supported 3d cam copies=D"

Most likely not until a non 3d dvd is released and people rip it. And I have my 3d glasses from Avatar still, which I went to see, they did not work on a cam copy, least not for me.

As how to seed, you simply do NOT remove the file from your torrent completed list.

Look under the ratio & upload to the right of the torrent file.

For me, I have seeded 2.74 gb worth for this thus far. Ratio is 6.428 I will cut it at a ratio of 10, and let the rest carry it on. generally a 1:1 ratio is considered respect meaning you seed the same size as the data you downloaded, 434.31 mb Some do more, some dont at all=/"

VLC would be your best bet (in my own opinion, of course) if you are looking for a good media player. "

yes, provided you have the video codec. You can also download Media Player Classic. Also consider Klite codex for the ability to watch any format video.

That is a decent program. I used it, but I personally prefer media player classic & installing klite codex. but none the less, thanks for helping with an answer. Respect dude"
,theRealKarmine,2010-11-20T08:28Z,fuck you and your VLC.  vlc is worse than WMP.
,laned130,2010-11-24T13:21Z,"Yeh, VLC used to be an awesome program that I would have recommended to anyone, but recently it's become really unstable, and the number of bugs just seem to increase with each release :-(
Currently, mine:
- won't play sound with video, untill I open up the Playback Devices window
- often freezes when I press stop
- often won't close, and sometimes when it does, the window goes but the process is still running
- sometimes won't play anything untill I reboot!
- oh, and it told me I was running the latest version when I wasn't, but installing the new version hasn't fixed any of my issues!
I'm an IT guy, I'm a big fan of VLC and open source principals: how can I recommend this?!"

You're an IT guy? If that's true you would know that opening the playback device window and continually rebooting your system in an attempt to fix your VLC issues is fucking retarded. That's like putting a bandaid on a broken leg, dumbass. You don't know shit. Simply uninstall VLC, delete the folder in pgrm files (if uninstall does not remove it) and reinstall the latest version. Wallah... fixed. "

real simple kids.. if you are downloading something from this site then you must obviously know what you should expect in a pirated version of a movie that hasn't been released as a dvdrip... especially if it is a bootleg cam of a 3D movie... so quit your complaining and sneak out of the house to go see it or wait until there's a descent release. Most of us real pirates are on private sites and never see uploads like this.. so best thing for you to do so you wont complain is learn how to be a real pirate and get yourself an invite to a private site...especially the americans.. this site will be banned from us soon... until then keep sailing... just to let you know how dedicated I used to be to this site and pirating check this pic out...https://pvhp1q.bay.livefilestore.com/y1pX7BRPnKX6Mp6iMPzb7cEXUbwY-Xi_W998D5zA1lHkUu1rs8etZW7SRmCvR9DdoFsr8EJ_nMECN0q1OZKBG9WdXZjNKZx2FyA/P1000320.JPG?psid=1"
