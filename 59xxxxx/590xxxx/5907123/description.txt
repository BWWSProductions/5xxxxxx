â€œTheyâ€â€”Texe Marrs Unravels the Mystery of Who Really is Behind the Global Illuminati Conspiracy

Patriot radio talk show hosts and website authors are constantly peppering audiences with accounts of Big Brother Police State abominations and the accelerating momentum of America toward economic collapse and a New World Order. But they are either too scared to tell us who is behind these things or they are simply ignorant. Who are â€œThey,â€ the conspirators behind the sinister evils that surround us? Is it the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderbergers, the Jesuits, the Masons, Obama and the socialists, the Rosicrucians, the Nazis, the Communists, the Bohemian Groveâ€¦? How can we fight against an undeclared enemy? Are patriot leaders and conspiracy researchers simply ignorant and unaware of who â€œTheyâ€ are? Are people in the know too afraid to even speak it out loud? Texe Marrs, ever unafraid, unravels the Mystery.
