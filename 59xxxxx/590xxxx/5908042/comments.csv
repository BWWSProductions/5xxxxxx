,tdmk1,2010-10-24T20:32Z,"Just noticed, ignore the date in the file name - TPB keeps erroring when I try to correct it - this is the race..."
,6fire6power6,2010-10-24T20:37Z,wow tdmk1 you rule!

,mianghuei,2010-10-24T20:45Z,Awesome!
,Loxxster,2010-10-24T21:06Z,"Thanks again Brother been waiting all day for this! I registered just to thank you for always doing a great and reliable job upping the races. The coverage in Canada is rubbish, so you can't beat the BBC commercial free. Thanks Again! :)"
,io23,2010-10-24T21:27Z,Thanx dude!
,CIwbIe0Z,2010-10-24T21:33Z,thank you thank you thank you...your vids are always flawless. now we just need some seeders.
,ablamboo,2010-10-24T22:10Z,"TDMK1, thank you once again - you are very best. Without you, we in the US would be forced to watch the awful drivel that passes for F1 coverage here. Did I say coverage? I meant four mediocre guys talking over each other while missing important events, all interrupted by frequent commercial breaks. Oh, and no informative pre- and post-coverage."
,hakuna_matata,2010-10-24T22:49Z,"Keep Seeding Guys

Earlier - SE-35 LE-1350
Now - SE-24 LE-1954

Dont remove the torrent after you are finished with downloading, your isp dont charge you for that. I am even seeding the last weekend torrents untill now. Sharing is Caring.

@tdmk1
thanks as always... regards"
,Phraed,2010-10-25T00:17Z,many thanks!!
,tuff24x,2010-10-25T02:26Z,"Seed you greedy bastards!

Thanks tdmk1 for the up!"
,Leib,2010-10-25T02:37Z,"Thanks again TDMK1

There is becoming a very sad state of affairs here on TPB - namely hit and run downloaders. I was downloading this torrent since it was 2 minutes old and am still downloading it 6 hours later because no one who became a seeder got hooked up to me even for one second today.

Are we in the motorsport community really such pigs that we can't give up a little bandwith for fellow enthusiasts ? 

Well I, at least, will continue seeding up to 100 kB/s for a couple of days after I've finished downloading, which is my usual behavior."
,tom911s,2010-10-25T03:21Z,"TDMK1 I can not thank you enough, I watch the actual race on Chinese CCTV5 but download your file the next day to get the best all round show for F1.
Thanks again"
,MikeR56,2010-10-25T04:04Z,I've uploaded more than I've downloaded. 7 hours gone by. Nothing bad to say about TDMK1. I have 25 meg ISP so you seeders must be selfish pricks.
,MikeR56,2010-10-25T04:18Z,"@Leib

Good point. I bet these bums wouldn't last if a ratio system existed. I like TPB but it's off the hook and very unreliable at times."
,hakuna_matata,2010-10-25T06:01Z,"I think the point is.. new people are coming to TPB and they dont fully know how how it works. I really hate these Hit and Runs... Its bad. but what to do. Now only its showing.. SE-1127 LE-1929 only now i am getting the file ..strangely Seeders are up now. 

Hope there is a way put to stop Hit & Runs on piratebay. 
"
,hakuna_matata,2010-10-25T06:08Z,"Just noticed.. Duration: 4h 28min wow .. and if forum is further ahead.. it will be fun. thanks tdmk1

@guys
where do the F1 enthusiast hang out .. I mean do u online at some forums or something ..to share talks. 


@Hit&Runs
I wish your processor fan stops working and heatsinks melts :P lol .. hehehe"
,danjoe,2010-10-25T07:04Z,Thanks tdmk1!
,lolaford,2010-10-25T09:14Z,"Thank TDMK1. 

Unfortunately I have to tell that I DL this race from another source and now seeding that. But I got your forum, and will never stop seeding these races and forums before I hit ratio 10 or above!

But I have a question regarding all races uploaded during this year and earlier. Why does it last so long to be here in TPB? What I'm saying is that coverage starts at 2PM and lasts until about 5PM raceday time. Why does it take 10 hours or more to have it uploaded here?

Please tell me because I honestly don't know, and waiting is bothering me sometimes.

Thanks and all the best!

,io23,2010-10-25T14:20Z,"Thanx again dude!


(Guys, I need some help. Just bought a 42"" plasma that plays .mp4/.m4v directly on the TV's USB! Problem is some files like this one the first couple of frames are messed up so it refuses to play:( Of course my PC doesn't care and that's where I'm gonna happily watch the race right now, but out of curiosity... Anyone know a free editor/splitter I can use to throw away the first couple of seconds, preferably without having to convert the whole file into something else? Thanx!!)"
,maazzee,2010-10-26T01:10Z,"I really hope one day to be possible to jump in and out of pc monitors so i can slap all those bitches that as soon as they get what they want from the community they do not seed, yet delete the torrent. 

TDMK is doing a fantastic job so you Morons can get the best F1 coverage in the WORLD without ADS and stupid ignorant comments from your localPresentators. You get all the pre and post race coverage and the Forum for Free just because ""idiots"" like myself seed two times more than what i have leeched so you can sit on your asses and watch. SEEDING a Torrent is what is WATER to FLOWERS. The flourishing of this community depends on SHARING. 

DO NOT STOP OR DELETE THE DOWNLOAD AFTER IT IS COMPLETED !!

400 SEEDERS 2500 LEECHERS 2 DAYS AFTER THE GRAND-PRIX ? FFS

SEED !

,tdmk1,2010-10-31T17:30Z,"Just received my work schedule for next weekend and I'm gonna be in Thurso, Scotland - basically as far away from my home without leaving the UK mainland!

This won't affect me capping the MotoGP & F1 on my Sky+ box, but I know there will be next to no chance I'll be able to get a 3G signal up there so I can RDP in to my server and upload it... Basically, I'm saying, the upload will be a few days late next week... :("
,io23,2010-11-05T13:27Z,"Thanx for the head's up!
Have fun up there (and a few aged malts while your at it)!:D"
