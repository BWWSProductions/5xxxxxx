,3CPTVC2,2011-01-22T07:53Z,To whoever is seeding from florida....your isp is throttling you back or your torrent program setup is not correctly setup. That's why we are all stuck at 94.8%  
,3CPTVC2,2011-01-22T08:04Z,"To whoever is seeding from Florida, either Comcast is throttling your connection back or the torrent software you are using is incorrectly setup. Therefore, we are all stuck at 94.8% which is useless as as these are .rar files"
,3CPTVC2,2011-01-22T20:36Z,"Mr. Florida Comcast, you cannot see it because you cannot see a seeder in the torrent, but your upload is choked. You need to increase your upload slots or nobody is going to be able to connect to you. The flag info on your IP address shows a small letter d which means it's available but choked. I hope you see one of these posts as we are all stuck at 94.8%"
