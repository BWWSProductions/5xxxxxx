I had seen this book in a bookstore in San Francisco a year ago, but never picked it up to look inside. I was blown away. This book goes way beyond drug-making techniques - it's basically a manual on making high-quality chemistry equipment. While I've seen other books touch on this topic, none have gone into this much detail. And I've never seen instructions for making large-scale/industrial chemical ware. Highly recommended if you're interested in chemistry of any kind.
