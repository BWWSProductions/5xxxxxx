Hunger is a dark exploration into the breakdown of humanity. How far would you go 
to survive in the most extreme of circumstances? Five strangers awaken to find 
themselves trapped in an underground dungeon. They soon realize they are the 
subjects of one man's sadistic experiment to test the depths of a human being's 
will to survive. As the days go by with no means of escape, their hunger increases 
as their humanity fades away.
