In this Shaun of the Dead style zombie comedy, Drex Greene (Napoleon Dynamiteâ€™s Jon Heder), a confused zombie who canâ€™t be any deader, tries to solve the case of the mystery pill that left him drowned in a bathtub. With the help of his wannabe filmmaker roommate Matt (The Daily Show's Josh Gad) and the sexy med student Cassie (Breaking Bad's Krysten Ritter), who first discovers Drex as he unzips himself from his own body bag, the three begin to uncover leads about why his death didnâ€™t stick, why a mystery online chat buddy is after him and why heâ€™s starting to show signs of superpowers. Will they figure out why Drex is only sort of dead? Will Cassie discover ancient Zombie secrets? Will Matt get a film career out of it? Or is falling in love actually what Drex needs to do to stay alive? Woke up Dead co-stars Wayne Knight (Seinfeld) and Jean Smart (24, Frasier).
