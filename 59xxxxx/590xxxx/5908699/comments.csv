,Stuhank,2010-10-25T13:31Z,Its not enough to upload a torrent its requires seeding as well ....Let me have it and I'll show you how its done....
,PixeeX,2010-10-25T18:00Z,"Really, Stuhank? Thanks for the no shit there. I'm the only one seeding it, it will take awhile. Can't handle a torrent being slow then DON'T D/L IT WHEN IT'S JUST POSTED 12 HOURS AGO. "
