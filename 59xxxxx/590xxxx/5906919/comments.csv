,Dolokhov,2010-11-12T15:42Z,This is what I was after. It looks like a comprehensive guide to using the coimmand line in Linux. It will probabably take my aged and alcohol addled brain about a year to figure it all out. But thank you ahead of time for at least giving me a chance to learn something.

Though, following URL will assist one who wants to read CHM on Linux:
