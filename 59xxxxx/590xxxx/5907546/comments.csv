It will show a lot of files and folders, u simply navigate to Contents folder, then MacOS folder, and you will see the file there.  U simply over-write it with the cracked one.  "

Unfortunately isn't working.
Most likely it is not an issue whit this specific share.

Mine crashes few minutes after launching.
It crashes after opening and letting it sit 1 or 2 minutes without any activity.(Untouched)
It crashes after few seconds of drafting lines picking the command from the tool bar.
If I pick a task from the menu bar, the pointer disappear but the tool tip will remain. Even though no action can be performed when the pointer is not present. Few seconds later AutoCRASHED!

I have tried everything around to no avail: Raw, Update 1, Update 2 and many other options.

And wait!
Lion is out in summer (2011) and I gave it a try in there. Result: there is not even a possibility to install. Installation screen appears grayed out.

Please give me some good news!

If any of you have experimented and solved this problem, plz let me know :)

,Go-Pirate,2011-04-25T01:18Z,"@rubengarciajr:
Being unable to install update 1 and update 2, bars you to fix very and many important issues that Autodesk is addressing with those updates, i.e. Copy and paste problem.
Refusing to fix those problems by applying those 2 updates render AutoCAD unbearable.
Even using the crack on an original, [un]updated version of AutoCAD 2011 for Mac stills is a very poor (rather useless). The app won't crash (BUT) you won't be able to select objects other than 2d Wireframes and the pointer will disappear (and won't work) if a command is selected from the top menu bar."

,casadomack,2011-08-04T20:46Z,"AutoCAD 2011 crashes on startup;
Complete Uninstall 

Guys, I figured this out and I'd like to share with you (I'm using Lion):

First, uninstall AutoCAD using it's own tool, then:
On FINDER, type ""auto"" on search;
A new search line will appear;
Click on ""+"";
On the first field select NAME;
On the second field select CONTAIN;
On the blank field type ""auto"" again;
You will see some filtering;
Click on ""+"" again;
On the first field select OTHER;
A big list will appear. Pick the SYSTEM FILES attribute;
On the second field select ARE INCLUDED;

Now you can manually delete all files that keep you CAD crashing, even when trying the uninstall tool.

Try installing AutoCAD again. Everything will work like a charm.

Hope this works for u to."
