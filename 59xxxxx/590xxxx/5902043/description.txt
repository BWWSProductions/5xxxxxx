				Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the complete second season of the Joseph Smith Papers series
that was shown on KJZZ TV.  This intriguing documentary series explores 
the ambitious effort to compile, transcribe, edit and present the papers 
of, by, and directly related to the LDS Prophet Joseph Smith.  In this 
series, Larry H. Miller and KJZZ Television have partnered with the 
Church History Department and a variety of prominent scholars to discuss 
the project, the documents, and the life and work of Joseph Smith.  

These video files were ripped from the 6-disc DVD set.  The discs 
contained no additional bonus features nor subtitles, or I would have 
included them as well.

				NOTES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
About the Joseph Smith Papers Project itself:

The Joseph Smith Papers (or Joseph Smith Papers Project) is a project 
researching, collecting, and publishing all manuscripts and documents 
created by or sent to Joseph Smith, Jr.(1805-1844), the founder and 
first prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS 
Church).

They will present the earliest handwritten and published texts of the
foundational documents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, including Joseph Smithâ€™s revelations and translations. The 
Papers will provide insights into Josephâ€™s life and times through his 
correspondence, journals, discourses, court cases, and business 
dealings. In addition, the Papers will contain minutes of important 
church councils, reproductions of the scriptural canon as it existed 
during Joseph Smithâ€™s lifetime, official histories, and records 
pertaining to church institutions that were under Joseph Smithâ€™s 
direction or that reflect his personal instruction and involvement.

With the Papersâ€™ publication, readers will have, for the first time 
in one place, access to these essential primary documents. To date, 
there never has been a complete listing, let alone a comprehensive 
edition, of Joseph Smith's papers. This ambitious project is intended 
to fill that gap. 

Although not an official part of the project, a documentary TV series 
also called The Joseph Smith Papers was created. This series 
documented the creation of and work involved in the Joseph Smith 
Papers Project. It was produced by KJZZ-TV in cooperation with the 
LDS Church Historical Department.
