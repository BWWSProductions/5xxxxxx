        In the wake of a messy divorce, Fran (Noni Hazlehurst,  Monkey
        Grip) is left to care  for her three children. Devoted  to her
        children  she  longs  for  more in  her  life  and  develops a
        relationship with Jeff (Alan Fletcher, Return Home), a barman.
        But Fran's endeavours to sustain a meaningful relationship and
        attend  to  her  matriarchal  duties  are  often  at conflict,
        causing her to call on close friend and neighbour Marge (Annie
        Byron,  Muriel's  Wedding) to  care  for the  children  in her
        absence.  Soon the  dynamics of love  and trust are  tested as
        Fran  faces a  betrayal destined  to tear  the fabric  of her
        family and thrust her into an uncertain future. 

        Winner of three AFI Awards, including Best Actress, Supporting
        Actress and Screenplay, Fran is a dramatic, thought  provoking
        story with insight and heart.
