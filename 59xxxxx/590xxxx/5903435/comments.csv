[V],twentyforty,2010-10-22T16:11Z,"@hunt_0710: I haven't switched off computer (and myself) last three days - and I am still little behind. 
Thanks.

@skillet92: UP was ready yesterday, both in 272p and 720p versions - but couldn't be upped.

I'll try to find free slot later tonight and left to upload during the night. Torrent you'll see tomorrow, early in CET morning."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-22T16:26Z,"One thing more: Requester should provide iMDB link or similar if anybody ask for information. Peek in from time to time, please. It's long forgotten, unwritten rule."
,i_am_sid,2010-10-22T16:37Z,"@twentyforty
Thanks for uploading my request 'wait until dark'. 
Ill try 'Insomnia' too."
,i_am_sid,2010-10-22T16:49Z,"Oops, forgot
+1 for quality which im sure is gonna be great."
,htctouch,2010-10-22T17:48Z,"thanx allot ... superb share

,skillet92,2010-10-22T17:49Z,"Yeah no problem.!
i have no problem when u upload it!!
i want the 720p version!
IT can WAIT! :)

Thanks a ton !"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-22T18:58Z,"@htctouch: I drastically improved quality by using HDMI between graphic card and my LG 23.3"". 272p still looks ugly full-screen, but on parallel Samsung CRT looks great. 480p however, look fantastic on both monitors."
,dandeak,2010-10-22T19:07Z,"Hi, I would like to place a request for an old movie I've seen when I was a kid, it's called ""The Day The Fish Came Out"", the link for the movie is here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061553/
Thank you."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-22T21:11Z,"@dandeak: I think I found one, but I am not sure is it dubbed or not. If it's good one, I would encode and up one next week. Let me know if ipod compatibility is wanted or not."
