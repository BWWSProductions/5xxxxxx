,distroyinmasses,2010-10-25T14:23Z,"if you change the date of your console off-line to 29/10/10 and play off-line could Microsoft tell you been playing early, cause that how most of the bans happen!"
,superztar,2010-10-25T15:34Z,"you get banned because the game isnt properly stealth patched, not because you play it early"
,mdrrain,2010-10-26T09:41Z,"I can't seem to get it to work...I loaded it into my dashboard using the same process (Extract the .Rars, Create folder with game's name, use xbox image viewer, extract to the folder I just created, delete system update, and upload it into the xbox via LAN using flash fxp I use for the other games and usually I have no problems or if I do have a problem, I usually backtrack my steps and find what I did wrong. Anyways the game shows up on my dashboard, however when I select to play it, the screen turns black (Like it would before a game is loaded/started up.) but stays black, any suggestions? Do I need to do something different for this one?"

New Protections Added to Leaked 12606 and Fall2010 Dashboard?

A new beta version [build 12606] of the Fall 2010 [alias 'Kinect'] dashboard has been leaked on the internet a few days ago and it seems like Microsoft added new protections to it. Several users seems to report problems booting certain games from recordable media on 360s with a modified DVD FW.
One of the titles affected seems to be Fable III. The game boots fine from any media on the current dashboard on a 360 with modified FW, but fails to boot from recordable media on the leaked/12606 beta dashboard [""This disc is unreadable""] - while the retail disc will work just fine according to #FW@EFnet.

Right now it's unclear which games, DVD models and/or modified FWs are exactly affected.

The new fall 2010 dashboard might get official released tomorrow [Tuesday Oct 26th 2010] (unconfirmed date, but it will be before Nov 4th anyway) to all 360 owners, so we suggest you do NOT update if you have a modified FW until we know more about these issues.
JTAG users should of course not update at all (will lock-out old CB and make the JTAG hack impossible), they should wait for a new rebooter."

You realy think M$ is that stupid?...:D."
[T],Sunblock.,2010-10-26T16:26Z,"what i can confirm is that it work on My old banned console with IX 1.6. But i pach it to wave 3. This something i dont recommend with none banned console.

I have not get tested on my New IX LT and i will not do that before its verified by abgx."
[T],Sunblock.,2010-10-26T16:28Z,Forgot. I do not have new BETA/Leaked 12606 Dash on it.
,mdrrain,2010-10-26T19:00Z,"I consider myself a little computer savvy, but I will admit when it comes to the xobox 360 related stuff, I am illiterate, what I can tell you though is this, I bought my xbox360 (Which is a JTAG, I can tell you that, and I believe it was hacked in November or december of 09, some time around there) I bought it from one of my co workers who hacked it himself, I've tried learning the basics EX: connecting it via cable from my laptop to the xbox and uploading the files for games through that way. Needless to say I figured it out...sot of, the co worker made a notepad file, emailed it to me and just told me where to put it. I keep it in offline mode on the xbox so microsoft can't sneak an update into it. At any rate I never updated the dashboard, I am sure by now there have been updates for freestyle dash but I never got around to it. Anyways, I think that is all I really know about it, I can't even figure out what version of the freestyle dash that I have, can't find it anywhere."
,billy234,2010-10-26T21:03Z,"Just to let you know that i downloaded this torrent, now the fix for abgx is available, this game is stealth. works fine"

,Nexxion,2010-10-27T02:22Z,Downloading at 110 kb/s - Not bad. Will comment after I burn it and test it out! Any ideas if I'll need to patch the Wave? I believe Fable III is Wave 6 and my xBox is only up to Wave 5.
,Rafael_1123,2010-10-27T06:20Z,"I DL the Beta version of the ""kinetic"" dashboard update but that was when it first got leaked a couple of weeks ago, am i having problems with this game becouse of that one too??

P.S. i can play Fallout: New Vegas but not this one.....any help?? and thanx in advance."
,Nexxion,2010-10-27T22:32Z,"Alright - Finished downloading - Works great!

I see no option for Spanish in this version - There are subtitles for Traditional Chinese, Czech, Hungarian, Korean, Polish, and Russian though. Kind of an odd mixture of languages."
,HoslerG,2010-10-27T23:06Z,"A++++++++++ Download, Works perfectly!!!"
,UnholySurge,2010-10-28T08:12Z,"Can anyone teach me the step by step procress of torrenting a game.
I have torrented many things and i know the general steps but have never done a game. i just neeed a basic 1.2.3 and im sure i can fill in the blanks. what programs i need what disks... and can the game be played online or will i be banned from xbox live?"
,Rafael_1123,2010-10-29T06:16Z,i downloaded the Kinect Dashboard Update 2.0.12416.0 BETA just when it came out......is this the reason I can`t play Fable 3??? plz help me out here!!! I would really appreciate the help....
,zingo 1,2010-10-31T01:35Z,Do you have to have the latest dashboard to play this game?
,lDunKs,2010-10-31T23:26Z,"No, you dont need the latest dashboard."
,remedy2,2010-11-01T04:20Z,Did this pass ABGX anyone?
,kdallas2010,2010-11-01T13:21Z,"@remedy2, yes it passed all stealth & CRC checks perfectly... did not need patching.

However I foolishly updated to the lastest dashboard and I'm getting the infamous ""Disc Unrecognized"" error.  Has to be something new in the disc protection... (Wave 7 ?).

Do you think this is an almost certain imminent ban for me?

Anyway.. take heed, stay offline to play this so you don't update."

,Dazza1138,2010-11-02T08:42Z,Works like a charm ;). PLEASE NOTE THOUGH: AP25 Checks have started with the latest release and it is advised to keep your FW's offline other wise you will be banned. Team Jungle & Team Xecuter are working on an LT+ firmware to bypass these AP25 Checks.
,CaineDeva,2010-11-02T15:36Z,"Dazza, what did you do to make it work? I ran it through ABGX a couple of times, burned it like normally, layer-break, the works.. And I still get the ""disc unrecognisable"".. Even before i updated my modded console with the new Dashboard (Which was an error on my part)"
,lDunKs,2010-11-05T01:02Z,"running into the error where it says "" DISC ERROr REMOVE TO CLEAN"" etc... i don't have the latest dashboard and this happened to me... the error pops up after 10 mins in the game. around the same scene every time i reboot. any idea how i can fix this?"

,eviltwig,2011-02-12T09:43Z,"Ok look noobs and wanna bes that dont explain shit but complain, Dude this works. Just make AGBX is the latest version, make sure to check "" Check Video/FIX"", my zone is set to 2 untill I get a error, make sure region is set right, ok do press Go! If its green all the way go for it and burn it, slow and steady wins the race, set it to 2x and make sure sector ##### is correct, make sure its Verbatum DVD DL +R, Im not here to argue disc types Im telling you what works for a actual PC Genius, burn baby burn and you will be playing like me, right now. I just burnt this and I'm online with the update required by Microsoft before I can actually play the game. So it works. Hopes this helps someone. P.S. This shit looks amazing already.

Run it through abgx, select level 3 from the autofix threshold tab. Hope that helps."
