Fable III, the latest
installment of the franchise
that allows you to forge your
own adventure through the
choices you make. Set five
decades after the events in
Fable II, the land of Albion
has enjoyed the fruits of the
industrial revolution, but the
fate of the kingdom is in
peril. As you are drawn into
the revolution, youll find
yourself in a position of
power. Whether you use that
power for personal gain or for
the greater good is up to you
unless you were predestined to
make those choices.
