,fatboy_17,2010-10-24T16:12Z,Good quality for an R5 really. Audio is a bit tinny though. A:6 V:7
,oak415,2010-10-24T23:46Z,"As always.. Team {1337x}-Noir has done it again. Excellent work gentlemen!

V=9
A=8  only minor issue is that audio is completely cut off at ending credits. Again..this is but a triffle."
,LiquidInsanity,2010-10-26T04:35Z,"A-6
V-8

Terrible movie, but thanks for the upload!"
,puppyup,2010-10-31T02:59Z,Are there any PROPER English subtitles? I only found auto-translated crap so far.
,iray8t,2010-11-08T09:17Z,"Well these new English subs just got posted on 8/11/10:
http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3941708/wall-street-money-never-sleeps-en
They are not perfect, but they are much better than the Google translated subs available so far.
They work with both this rip (noir) as well as the Maxspeed version."
,briareosdeunan,2010-11-28T02:26Z,"Here is my rate: (Out of 10)
Audio= 9
Video= 10
Movie= 9

Better than the first sequel for me.
Any problems with your video player or anything under the sun? 
Please e-mail me at emzdoe@yahoo.com.
Thanks for the upload. I really appreciate it."
