Cold Fear is the first action-horror title under the Ubisoft brand. The game is set in a dynamic environment on a stormy sea, including intense combat, intelligent enemies, and a high element of the shockingly unexpected. Your life jacket wonÃ¢Â€â„¢t be sufficient. Players step into the role of Tom Hansen, a U.S. Coast Guard who is sent to board a drifting Russian whaling ship in the middle of a howling storm on the Bering Sea, who will discover there is no safe place here. On this constantly rocking and shifting ship and a mysterious oil rig, players must turn their interactive surroundings to their advantage to take down human enemies â€“ and enemies that arenÃ¢Â€â„¢t human any more â€“ and save their own life.
