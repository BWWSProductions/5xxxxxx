Storyline:

For nearly 200 million years while dinosaurs roamed the Earth, the seas teemed with some of the most awe-inspiring ocean creatures of all time.
Sea Monsters, a National Geographic Giant Screen film, is an entertaining journey into prehistoric oceans.
Inter-cutting between the animated story and the reenactments of fossil discoveries combine the appeal of "Indiana Jones" with the CGI that brings these prehistoric monsters to life.
Perfect for the whole family.
