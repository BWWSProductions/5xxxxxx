A collection of songs based around guitar and fretless bass. 
Blissful ambience finishing with the apocalyptic post rock of 'Where I Stand'. 
These songs were recorded over the last few years, using different techniques and equipment for each song. All that links them is the presence of my trusty, battered, old guitar and fretless bass.
