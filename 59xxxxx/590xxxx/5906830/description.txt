THIS SHOW CONTAINS PREVIOUSLY AIRED MATERIAL.
	
This broadcast is a strange one, and I'll admit that I have not listened to the whole thing. It begins without the usual theme music and launches straight into the beginning of the September 25th show. I don't know that it is a complete repeat of that show or pasted-together highlights from various shows, or what. But this IS the second week in a row without a new show, and without any explanation [either on GCN's web site or on MaxKeiser.com].

My guess is, from what I did hear, that GCN edited this together in order to have something to fill the timeslot today... and I have to say they did a rather poor job of it.

My inclination was to not upload this at all, but perhaps someone out there will get more out of this than I did.





This is Max Keiser's show on the GCN radio network.
It airs Saturday mornings from 9:00 - 10:00 Central Time.


================================================================


Rigged market capitalists and banking oligarchs are at war with the people. With the collusion of the politicians and the central bank they own, bankers have created a gulag casino state designed to annihilate competition and prosperity.

Financial war reporter, Max Keiser, a former Wall Street banker and options trader, knows how the markets are rigged to explode at the push of one deliberately fat finger. With co-host, Stacy Herbert, the Truth about Markets team warns you of market manipulation, fraud and scandal before it destroys your wealth and opportunity.

Max Keiser presents financial investigations and entertainment for television networks around the world, including Aljazeera English, BBC Worldwide, PressTV and RT. He previously hosted a CBS/KLSX Los Angeles, a segment of Access Hollywood for NBC. He's the creator of the Hollywood Stock Exchange and inventor of the virtual specialist technology on which the exchange operates.

It's time to rise up against the financial tyranny of rigged market capitalism and banking occupation!

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 until you've researched it yourself.
