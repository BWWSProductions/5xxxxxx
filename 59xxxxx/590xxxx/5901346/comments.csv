,OrpheusDude,2011-09-29T10:23Z,"I have delved extensively into all the available torrents for this film at TPB and Demonoid, and this is by far the best quality torrent available.  And no: it is not censored.  It is an ISO file packed into a WinRar file and opens a VIDEO_TS file which you can burn onto DVD with zero loss in quality.  The film in is English with 5.1 Dolby, and has optional Finnish subtitles.  Narration is by Johnny Depp.

The film is good, but a little disappointing compared to some others in the genre (such as ""Janis: A Film"" or the incredible ""Who Is Harry Nilsson (And Why Is Everybody Talkin' About Him)?"" which is essential viewing to anyone who has ever sung a song, or even thought about singing a song).
