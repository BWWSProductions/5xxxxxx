,longdistance,2010-10-23T23:15Z,"Thanks for your work in uploading these ""diet"" versions  of the shows. I regularly download your Stargate Universe, Smallville, & Sanctuary. I live in Africa so have a slow connection. 350MB usually takes a day and a half. Yours can be downloaded in about eight hours. They look GREAT on our 25"" analog TV - actually I can see no difference from 350MB files. Keep up the good work!"
