,reyfox1,2011-12-25T17:24Z,This film is not complete. The subtitles at the end just before the credits that tell what happened to everyone after college are missing. This is a very important part of the film and why anyone would remove them is beyond me. My advice is to find another torrent. Shame on whoever removed them.
