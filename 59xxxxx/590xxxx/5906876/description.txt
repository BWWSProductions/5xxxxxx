Dont know why or when i bought this cd but the music on it is a darn good , a whole lot of energy, very tight and together, and without question all of the guys in Atomic City Rhythm Rascals are excellent musicians. The only problem with this recording is that I wanted to hear more of Evan Carawan's great hammer dulcimer playing. I would however buy it just for the first track alone, that being Two Steps Back. That being said, this CD delivers on the tunes - there are 25 and each one is wonderfully performed.
