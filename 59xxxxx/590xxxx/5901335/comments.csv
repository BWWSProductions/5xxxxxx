Can you or anyone else on here, please point me in the right direction/link, to grab an .MKV to DVD converter app? Although you mention AVI is a container too, i have other converters,but none open .MKV files?
 (99% probable chance is cos i don't know what i'm doing! Lmao)
I have spent the 2 past days trying to D/L a converter, but most of them are scam apps, and they don't let you convert anything.. 
I am going crazy please help! :o/

,thajazz,2011-04-17T07:11Z,"Hey RiddlerA, In the process of downloading all series of The Wire. Great series and thanks for the upload. I do have a problem, the first season the files where perfect. In the second season some episodes the video was split in four, lenght ways, with each layer shifting a few cm's to the right... Season three, same problem on more episodes... I'm using VLC, that should work right? Don't know how to fix this... Any suggestions? Thanks!"
