Look at paragraph 3."
,mckayi,2010-10-23T21:55Z,Don't download wait for the crack....its  not included on the dvd its just a trick..
[T],Coolguy33,2010-10-23T22:38Z,"Works great. Just follow the instructions!......the cracked content is in the SKIDROW folder!!

The control system is much easier than in previous games. All can be controlled using the mouse. "
,smith231,2010-10-24T01:05Z,"@Stu1977: download the file and look in the skidrow folder, no fucking crack. why dont you inform yourself better before telling people how to work their torrents"
,smith231,2010-10-24T01:10Z,"crack: http://www#easy-share#com/1912695914/RailWorks.2.Crack.Only-SKIDROW.rar

replace # with ."
[T],Coolguy33,2010-10-24T15:43Z,"@Stu1977, all the content that you see in the SKIDROW folder is the crack.  Copy and paste everything you see in the SKIDROW folder to where the installation folder is. It is usually (C:\Program Files\RailSimulator.com\RailWorks 2) and overwrite the existing files.  No problem!"

My bad, the comment was meant for smith231"
,smith231,2010-10-24T23:05Z,"@Coolguy33: my bad, i downloaded another railworks 2 torrent that contained a link to a website where you had to do a survey to donwload the crack and i assumed (based on ed12345's and other comments) that the crack wasnt included in this release"
[T],Coolguy33,2010-10-25T00:48Z,"@smith231, no worries man shit happens.  I always trust and download the SKIDROW, RELOADED, Razor1911 torrents etc only on here. Other websites will try and con you. 
Hope you got the game to work anyway !!"
,tatterss,2010-11-03T08:14Z,"Cheers for posting this torrent up! 

Just a couple of quick questions:

1) are there any addons available for this game yet? 

2) would the old addons (ie. this torrent by railgamelover: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5323235/Railworks_Addons) work with Railworks 2? or if I tried to install them would I just completely stuff the new version of this game due to incompatibility?

Thanks in advance for your help.

,skid222,2010-11-11T16:40Z,"Don't work. I downloaded, burnt and installed, then copy/paste the skidrow contents into game folder. game would not work."
,vineet120,2010-11-19T08:30Z,thnx it works
,Gamer133,2010-11-25T22:11Z,"Ok im sorry if im annoying anyone, but first of all, is this the game Railworks 2 or some kind of addon?
You see, I downloaded this torrent, and I opened up the folder. All i saw was the .iso file and the information file. there is no ""Skidrow Folder"" as said in the below comments."
,Jakubs,2010-11-27T15:35Z,"everything works as it should, I do not know what this bullshit nonsense:
1) install the game
2) to drive F: \ SKIDROW copy everything in that folder and paste them into folders RailWorks.2-SKIDROW \ Railworks 2 and start the game"
,Acrose12,2010-12-29T03:16Z,"Trust SKIDROW guys so far no viruses or Malware/trojans NOTHING THAT CAN HARM UR PC, we nbeed more uploaders like SKIDROW in this world "

,_martijn,2011-01-24T09:55Z,"Thanks for the torrent!

One question: When I'd like to play the game I got an announcement: Please login to Steam

I have only the mountable file, no other files in the download folder"
,Cruzu,2011-02-11T13:39Z,Where is the crack folder? The only two files that I got is the iso and a 'SKIDROW' thing but it's not a folder!
,namkong,2011-02-12T10:53Z,"Cruzu
Mount or burn the image first, then you will see the Skidrow folder on the DVD"
,hmhs,2011-02-20T17:44Z,Thanks! Works perfect!=)
,DWarbird,2011-03-06T00:39Z,"Jesus Christ some of you guys are freaking stupid.  If you don't have the technical ability to crack software nor understand how cracking works then I'm afraid you're just too retarded to be using it.  Go pay for it, uninstall your bit torrent client and go play some stupid Facebook games like the other computer noobs do.

Thanks uploader!!!"
,jc98,2011-03-10T22:00Z,Works great!
,bialystok,2011-04-05T11:14Z,where is the password for the rar file?

,MC214,2011-04-26T13:02Z,"I downloaded, burnt and installed, copied and replaced the files as i needed to when I open the game and click 'Start Railworks 2' a box comes up and says the following..""This application has failed to start because PHYSXLoader.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem."" So I was wondering did I do something wrong or should I just reinstall?"
,heli3,2011-05-02T16:34Z,Railworks perfectly! Thanks for the upload :D

,Trooper47,2011-06-08T21:31Z,"Hey I have i question.

The game does not seem to save your progression. When you complete a scenario you get a green mark in the scenario select menu. 

Can this be fixed? Or is it because the pirated version is not linked to a steam account?"
,24485,2011-06-14T04:55Z,I've got the same question as Trooper47
,Trooper47,2011-06-14T20:09Z,"For clarification, The green wink disappears when you restart the game. The fixing refers to, is there a fix that makes the green wink stay after restarting the game. "
,gearheadtheman,2011-06-29T08:42Z,"The torrent comes with the image file, and a system information file called skidrow. I don't see a crack, and when I put the system file where it tells me to adn start the game, it still doesnt work. Is something wrong?"
,gearheadtheman,2011-06-29T08:45Z,"nevermind, I figured it out"

,cowboy4hacking,2011-08-01T20:27Z,"Hello, Thank you very much for this torrent! :) Im having one problem though, I read over the install instructions over and over to make sure im not being a dumbass and forgetting something. So here's whats happening, I downloaded the torrent, Burned everything to a dvd, Installed the dvd/game onto my harddrive, I then open up the CD, Copy the SKIDROW file over to My Computer/C/Program files/Railworks2/ And replace everything in that folder with the SKIDROW content off the disk... I close everything, Go to the game shortcut and open, and It tells me to sign into steam, Then i sign into steam, and it keeps telling me over and over to sign in, or it cannot open the game due to steam not registering some files.... Can someone PLEASE help me out here, I see a few others are having the same problem i am. Thanks in advance for any help! "

,BobMarleyLives,2011-08-25T07:12Z,"to everybody with the steam issue, dont flame me if im wrong this is just an idea, but, if you go to the top left of steam itself click that and click ""go offline"" then go to your library and add a non steam game...this is just an idea as i had to do it with duels of the plainswalkers 2012..just give it a try"
,crazychum,2011-08-30T17:46Z,"IMPORTANT (WHAT FIXED THE STEAM ISSUE), you copy the WHOLE of the skidrow folder CONTENTS into the installation directory!"
,daza1411,2011-09-11T19:42Z,this is really frustrating i have burnt and installed and cut the skidrow file and copied it into the file location however when it starts up it saying no strings what is that all about someone please help
