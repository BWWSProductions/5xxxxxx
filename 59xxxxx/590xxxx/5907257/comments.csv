,irahk,2010-10-30T00:41Z,"Sadly this doesnt work. I used the launched and it still crashes b4 the game starts. Is there a fix for this release, or is this just a bad rip? I tried using other cracks but none worked. I advise dloading a different release"
,irahk,2010-10-30T03:04Z,"I get 5 errors during installation....they all say this:

precomp.exe Unable to locate component

This application has failed to start because zlib1.dll was not found"
,ShadoTBT,2010-10-30T03:26Z,"to irahk and anyone else that is missing zlib1.dll

go to 

http://www.dlldump.com/download-dll-files_new.php/dllfiles/Z/zlib1.dll/1.2.1.1429r/download.html

and download the dll and place it in your installation folder"
,JoeKKer,2010-10-30T04:11Z,"It Cud Never Happen That This Rip Doesnt Work , Coz Many Of My Frnds Are Playing This Right Now,"
,JoeKKer,2010-10-30T04:15Z,"Please Press Yes While Adding To Regitry , So That The Rip Will Work"
,ShadoTBT,2010-10-30T04:22Z,"CONFIRMED AS WORKING.

Works perfectly, thanks Joekker, you deserve a skull.

the instructions are a bit vague so here is how to properly install it:

mount ""Fallout.New.Vegas.RiP.JoeKkerr""

once mounted run ""Fallout.New.Vegas.RiP.part1""

click install and wait for it to finish

a popup will appear telling you to press anykey, press anykey

if you get an error saying that you are missing zlib1.dll see my post above 

once it is finished installing RUN THE SHORTCUT ON YOUR DESKTOP

DO NOT RUN ANYTHING FROM THE INSTALL FOLDER

happy fallouting
"
,ShadoTBT,2010-10-30T04:41Z,"ok, there seems to be a lot of missing textures.

,guna24,2010-10-30T12:02Z,i found the reason for crash before start the game..download Zilb.dll frm above link and place it game install folder (important: u have to place zilb.dll file before extract and install the game into specific folder not after installation)
,JoeKKer,2010-10-31T05:25Z,"After Mounting The ISO Extract Where U Have To Extract , Then Copy Zlib.dll File Where U have Extracted And Then Start Instalation"
,Awes0meX,2010-11-01T03:01Z,"Hi, I downloaded your previous dead rising 2 torrent and had no problem, but I seem to be having the zlib1.dll problem with this torrent.

 I downloaded the zlib1.dll and put it in C:/programfiles/fallout  , then extracted the folder after mounting the iso and put the folder in C:/programfiles/fallout as well. I then started the install and I got a message several times during the install saying I was missing the zlib1.dll file. When the install finished and I tried to start the game it crashed. What did I do wrong?"
,JoeKKer,2010-11-01T10:20Z,Problem Should Not Arise After Downloading zlib.dll !! Strange
,VitaLLzz123,2010-11-01T13:46Z,"you have to put .dll to data folder, when it start installing the game, not simple in the game folder"

,kidkayos,2010-11-03T02:05Z,"I'm a little confused here - is there supposed to be an intro movie? When I start it, I'm lying in the docs office and he's asking me questions and everyone keeps talking about the ""ones that shot me"". Is there supposed to be some sort of intro showing how I ended up in town?"
,chinzy12,2010-11-03T08:04Z,Any way to replace the intro movie??
