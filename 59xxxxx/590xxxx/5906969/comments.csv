[T],Kill3rK,2010-10-24T08:25Z,"Clean Scene Releases    http://bitxtre.me/

This release may have ""rar files"", thats how they are uploaded to ""top sites"" if and when a ""scene"" group upload to those top sites the files that are originally ""spread"" to other ""top sites"" aka ""affill sites"" can and do make there way to p2p (like here on TPB). These ""rar"" ""files"" are the safest way to download from public trackers especially if there is a ""sfv"" and an ""nfo"" file included as that indicates the release is good, while i understand that ""rar"" files double the hard drive space needed to unpack and of course seed is not an option for some of you guys, but safety is the way to go in my opinion, anyways all the words i have quoted ""quote"" please google them , then you will be better informed.


If You need more help understanding the scene Google it :) "

Thanks for explanation, but I was always confident that RAR file division had nothing to do with safety. As I always understood, the reason for a split file, was that beacase there is no ""resume"" on IRC, hence by dividing the file, you could collect needed file in intervals.
Let me'splain it ... IRC was the original ""file shearer""  road. It was quite primitive and it was pretty much a closed/secluded gruop 
It definitely was not a huge P2P network as it is today.
I still remember when MAME was still (even after few years) the best thing that could come out of the emulator world (at the time)... (still kind of is...), and I was trying to get a ""metal slug"" on in (54MB i think) it took forever.
So... to summarize... I don't think it's an security issue... BUT please (and I'm not being sarcastic)... can you really explain why division of files is more secure?

The reasons I can think of at this moment are... if sh^t happened you could say ""I was n't downloading thewhole thing..."" which I don't think would stood up in a court.
