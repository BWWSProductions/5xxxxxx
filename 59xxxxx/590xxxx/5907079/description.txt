Hidden Agenda Volumes 1-6




A great collection of classic conspiracy films.

Tragic events through out our history have been guided behind closed doors by unseen forces with a "Hidden Agenda" to manipulate governments and institutions, control the resources of our planet and shape the way we think.

This series retraces the history of "Real Conspiracies That Affect Our Lives Today." Includes the entire Hidden Agenda series from the research of G. Edward Griffin.

NOTE - Specs for each video file can be found in the .nfo file included in the torrent.

Volume 1: The Capitalist Consipracy

Discover the history of an elite group that maintains absolute power over the global economy. This unique film exposes how this group is shielded by governments, exerts enormous influence over education and mass media, and succeeds in creating money from nothing. The film reveals how elitists manipulate the geo-political landscape by both demonizing and financially supporting Communist countries. And by creating an exaggerated fear of nuclear war they succeed in persuading people to embrace their hidden agenda: a world government controlled by them.

Running Time: 48 Minutes 2 Seconds


Volume 2: The Subversion Factor

This program is presented in two parts--Moles In High Places and The Open Gates of Troy--exposing the systematic and disturbing history of subversion by enemy agents of the US government from 1920s to the present day. Evidence is culled from public records and supported by remarkable newsreel footage. Learn the real truth about Alger Hiss and the theft of atomic bomb secrets. Discover how Communist spies penetrated the OSS before it became the CIA. Most disturbing of all is the revelation that every defense the US government once had against subversion has now been dismantled.

Running Time: 1 Hour 55 Minutes 51 Seconds


Volume 3: The Truth About Communism

This program is presented in two parts. PART 1: THE TRUTH ABOUT COMMUNISM presents the violent rise of the Soviet Empire, from the chaos of revolution to the terror of the Cold War, and is charted using remarkable footage of actual events. This is the best collection of historical film footage on the topic of Communist Imperialism ever assembled. PART 2: ONLY THE BRAVE ARE FREE is a classic film exposÃ© presenting the truth behind the Spanish Civil War and demonstrates how a small group of infiltrators were able to capture the country while the majority were fooled by slogans of reform. A rare find for both the student and film collector.

Running Time: 2 Hours 0 Minutes 53 Seconds


Volume 4: Anarchy USA

This astonishing film, produced at the height of the Civil Rights movement, has become more relevant today than when it was first made in 1965. Instead of merely telling the story of the 1960s riots, the film explores the circumstances preceding those riots and exposes a covert agenda which profits from the conflict of one group against another. This program reveals how agitation in America in the name of civil rights compares to similar movements that led to the overthrow of many governments around the world.

Running Time: 1 Hour 16 Minutes 50 Seconds


Volume 5: Katanga, The Untold Story Of U.N. Betrayal

The shocking story of how the United Nations from 1960-1962 under the guise of a peacekeeping force waged unprovoked war against the anti-Communist state of Katanga, forcing it under the control of the Communist puppet-state of the Central Congo (now called Zaire.)

Running Time: 1 Hour 0 Minutes 26 Seconds


Volume 6: No Place To Hide: The Strategy & Tactics Of Terrorism

This film reveals the clandestine motive behind the seemingly irrational acts of international terrorism, exposing a long-term strategy aimed at destroying selected governments. Using meticulous research and documented facts, this film shows how terrorism is utilized to implement one phase of the Marxist-Leninist dogma know as Wars of National Liberation. When target governments are finally toppled, it isn't the terrorists who will come to power, but the international Marxist apparatus which trained and supplied them. Here are the indisputable facts revealing the operation of this network.

Running Time: 57 Minutes 50 Seconds
