Do you mind if i make a request? 

I cant seem to find a good 720p copy of Quantum of Solace, could you upload this please? "
,Johnny575,2010-10-31T14:25Z,"It stopped at 99.8%.
Is that normal?"
,brainalyser,2010-10-31T23:23Z,"Please Seed, I'm stuck at 99.99 % for a week now."
,Johnny575,2010-11-01T21:49Z,"Really annoying. It was downloading superfast until 99.8%... then nothing.
mkv2vob can't mux the file because of the few missing packets."
[V],GoodFilms,2010-11-04T00:59Z,"As you can see, there are many seeds. It's not stuck."
,tokekaneh,2010-11-04T18:21Z,"there is indeed a problem with this torrent.

there are 3 x 4.0meg segments which are 'stuck'

there are 50+ peers in my list stuck at 98.8%

-thanks"

,chnord,2010-11-06T22:56Z,"As highlighted tokekaneh, there is a problem. Despite the fact that there are seeds, the tracker seems to experience difficulties.

I am stuck at 99.8% as well and have been downloading/seeding for 2 weeks now day and night.

please help and don't just say there are seeds.

thks"
,Xtingu1sh,2010-11-10T10:39Z,PLEASE SEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMFG!!!! stuck at 99.8%
,neilmccauley,2010-12-13T05:10Z,I have been stuck at 99.8% for over a month now. Something is wrong.
[V],GoodFilms,2010-12-14T15:08Z,"No, none of you are stuck on this. You are downloading a different torrent."
,ro4eva,2011-02-08T18:58Z,"For those of you who are stuck at 99%:

Try changing the extension to .mkv and play it.  Chances are the file has actually finished downloading but the torrent file is bugged.

This has happened a few times to me and all I did was change the extension and watched the film and it was 100% downloaded even though it says (for example) 99.7%."
,Spartin101,2011-05-15T21:37Z,"Hay please seed!!!!!!>>>>>

,digs5446,2011-06-25T14:57Z,finished downloading 100% for me just fine...
