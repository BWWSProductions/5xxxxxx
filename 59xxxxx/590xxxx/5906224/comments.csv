,Cold71,2010-10-24T15:59Z,Is this legit and just ripped by a noob? Archive.rar seriously? I also find it a little odd that bone has uploaded atleast two versions of the same torrent.

,AirsoftNL,2010-10-25T13:10Z,"I just downloaded it and it had a pretty decent downloading speed.
But.
When i unpacked all the rar. files it created one big rar. file called ""Fable 3"". Shouldn't this be an ISO? And also, it didn't create a .dvd file which is used to burn the game by opening it in ImgBurn.

Anyone know how to solve this?
Thanks in advance."

It says 'stealth status is uncertain', but most of the things were green and its also checked by the other guy, so its probable safe.

Theres at least 50 tutorials in youtube."

,chickenboi1990,2010-10-26T19:41Z,"For those having the Xex CRC problem, I found a fix to get abgx to verify.

First, use abgx with level 3 autofix. Check all of the SS challenge boxes, and turn on ""check for AnyDVD style game corruption""

abgx will do a AnyDVD style check, and will verify the CRC while doing it.

Next, run abgx again, same settings, but this time use AutoFix level 2. This tiem it will download the needed Xex.ini file and abgx will claim that all CRC's match and stealth has passed."

I downloaded the torrent fine, then I right clicked one of the rar files and made an iso, passed it through abgx which said it was fine, and then burned the dvd file to a dl. But then when I tried to play the disk it tries to read it but after a few seconds it says the disk is unreadable. It detects the disk fine and after a few seconds it even says play fable 3 but every time I click it, it still says the disk is unreadable, someone help please."

I think someone said earlier that the disk read error could be because you haven't updated dashboard. also, are you using ixtreme lt or an activate disk? And did abgx verify stealth and all crc, or just stealth?"

micro$oft for you. sux.

not sure what the solution is, fortunately i have another xbox which i haven't updated and that still works.

so its not your hardware (drive or disk) thats knackered. "
,AirsoftNL,2010-11-03T17:56Z,"@ niatrinh:

I'm sure it will work (and be safe) after the new firmware is out (if u wanna play online and u have updated ur firmware), cus this should be the same game as they sell in retail.
Though u really shouldnt run this game (even offline) with the update installed, cus ull be flagged for sure (this is a microsoft game)."

,mslick87,2010-11-19T23:22Z,hi sorry but xbox have baned fable 3 from working with the new dashboard only proper disk will work 
,abyssone,2010-11-21T22:08Z,"Works fine for sure just tested. (afer failing first time since im nub)
iXtreme LT 1.7 Firmware  if im right. 
dunno what dashboard is i thing some game updated it some time ago, its not most recent one.
And for pc just windows xp and 7-zip for unziping...

Anyway,
1. download torrent using torrent client such as (utorrent azureus etc etc...) (for those that dont know how to dl torrents lol :P )

2.I do unziping like this, i double click one of the zip files (inside i find one big .iso file of some 7 gigs, drag and drop it, then all this little zip filesi guess unzip it. and you got your 7 gigs or something .ISO file.

Now i made mistake here and just burned that lol .... which give (disc unreadable something error).

3.What you actually must do is, dl that abgx360 tool from their page .
leave all default and click that launch button on botom. And dvd file is made.

4. Using imgburn , and write image to file option select .dvd file and burn it on x4. (dunno what discs you use verbatim dvd+r DL is what always serves me well)

And game should work !

After this rush to shop of course and buy game and bow down to microsoft."
,h2h3h4,2010-11-27T13:28Z,before fable 3 would not work with the new dash board but now i have flashed my 360 again with the new firmware lt+ and downloadded the latest abgx360 and have patched fable and assassins creed again and burned it using img burn and guess what they both work to all u haters out there this is no crap just trying to help a few ppl out there that have the same questions u dont need any other programs hope this has been help full
,deadvirgo,2010-12-03T06:14Z,"yeah, update your firmware to the new ixtreme lt+ and run through newest version of abgx with level 3 autofix and check for anystyle dvd corruption checked. abgx should download some shit and then if you run it through a second time it passes. same with Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood.
