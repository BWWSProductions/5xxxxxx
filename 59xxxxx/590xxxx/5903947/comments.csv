,Bynx,2010-12-14T01:46Z,The disk in top left corner changes to Sniper Elite. Clicking that brings up the title page. Clicking start and the screen goes black and thats it. It wont load up. Any ideas. I used Mac's Disk Utility selected the ISO file and burned disk. My wii is hard wired to allow 3rd party discs.

,hackmo,2012-01-23T20:29Z,The only way I found to get this to work is it really depends on your T.v. I have many different lcd's and only my Vizio would play it correctly. Sony was Black and White. I tried every config. that was as close as I got until I put it on the Vizio. Not saying this will work for you but if you have a Vizio or a different T.V. you might try it. No i'm not trying to sale Vizio's so don't ask lol!
