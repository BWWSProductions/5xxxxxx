Thanks in advance, can't wait to play..."
,colebran,2010-10-25T04:30Z,The game is sick! If you can spare $2 its fast downloading from http://uploadstore.net/users/Poterek/877/Star.Wars.The.Force.Unleashed.2.2010.CLONEDVD-P2P
,krimik,2010-10-25T05:25Z,Looks like all the menus and stuff within the game are in russian too. But I assume the voice overs are all english.
,john6425,2010-10-25T08:52Z,"Finished the DL

Here are the details:

The download is in Russian as stated, you can go into the registry and change the menus to english. Simply download the crack that was posted on TPB and it has instructions for where to go in the registry to do that. 



NOTHING will render in this game for me properly. I have tried toggling the settings, playing at lowest res and lowest graphics options to no avail. I can't see the characters! 

Radeon HD 5770 
AMD Phenom II X4 3.2GHz
2GB Corsair XMS3 Ram

Using latest DX version, might try to run this in compatibility mode, but seems like this I'll have to wait for another release! =(

Anyone got this working?

Worked for me to get the menus in English

,john6425,2010-10-25T08:55Z,Took maybe 20mins or MORE to install this stupid game! Takes a long time to copy the files!

Anyone who have a familiar problem? Any suggestions?"

,Rohan151,2010-10-25T19:57Z,"For anyone using Radeon cards, you must update your drivers to Catalyst 10.10. Anything below that results in severe texture issues."
,Rohan151,2010-10-25T20:10Z,"Shinrad - No, the English cut-scenes haven't been taken out. The Russian cut-scenes are all in English, but because the game is looking specifically for English cut-scenes, it crashes. Just switch the language back to Russian (make sure you've got everything properly setup first - graphics, controls, etc) and you've got working, English-language cut-scenes.

Bit of a mess, this distro.

Also, anyone using Radeon cards should update their drivers to Catalyst 10.10. Using any other driver version will result in severe texture issues."

,PleaseDontBanMe,2010-10-25T23:14Z,Just started playing this game about an hour ago. I updated my graphics drivers to 10.10 although 10.9 still played it fine. This game is absolutely disgustingly nastily incredibly sick so far. Also this crack posted on a previous comment is 100% working http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5908207/Star_Wars_Force_Unleashed_2_Crack_Only_READNFO_Tam . Have Fun!
,john6425,2010-10-26T01:12Z,"Ok the graphics update from ATI worked to fix the textures as stated


I can see my characters now

however!... I get 2 FPS!! 

So I dropped the res down to 800x600 and on lowest setting now I'm getting prob 10FPS LMAO


Something is very wrong! I played crysis warhead on enthusiast!"

Either you're retarded, your computer sucks, or you didn't install your video drivers correctly. I'm playing this on Ultra settings 1920x1080 getting 100+ fps with catalyst 10.10

The game is about 8.6 gigabytes"

,g0dsize,2010-10-26T07:00Z,"@john6425 - Perhaps your AV updated in those couple hours, and is now detecting the file as a ""false positive.""  Solution - set AVG to ""ignore"" that file.  Happy gaming to ya."
,Rohan151,2010-10-26T08:37Z,"thebeav111 - I'm not sure you can, I'm not at my desktop atm but I think everything is in .pak files, which would mean they'd need to be extracted and repacked. I'm not sure if that's possible.

PleaseDontBanMe - You deserve to be banned with an attitude like that! Something always goes wrong somewhere with games, what with the massive numbers of configurations out there, not to mention driver versions, etc."

,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-10-26T10:37Z,"Guys, i'm totally stuck on this game... and since there's shit out about it atm, i can't really look it up to find out how to get past this one part...

I'm at the part where you have to keep the stormtroopers and shit away from the guns on the ship... It's the part where one of the guns had been shot against the wall, and u need to place a power cell into it to blast away the wall so you can continue... the thing is, the powercell i'm supposed to use keep exploding, even when i try to take it out of one of the guns. There is one other cell, in another gun, but i'm unable to remove it at all.

So, either i'm an idiot and don't know what to do... or this indeed is just a demo game an you can't go beyond that point.

I'm hoping it's the former. Any help?"
,john6425,2010-10-26T11:00Z,"It's damn near impossible to install the drivers WRONG

Also after the install it fixed the textures, but I still have the problem with low FPS, it's unplayable

,SolarJaw,2010-10-26T12:47Z,"Guys, I'v got smth that no1 else had - judgeing by comments.

I'v installed new drivers for my ATI, chang'd lingo in registry.

Straight after downloading/changing lingo game crashed right after selecting new game - first a bit of loading screen, than ""SWTFU2.exe"" has stopped working.

Now when I'v changed fmv name, first cutscene loads and plays ok, but as soon as it finishes I'm getting the same thing - loading screen, and crash.

My pc is runnung w7x86 and is""a bit"" below recommended specs, but I think the game still SHOULD play  ( I don't mind playing in low detail )

Tried 2 cracks so far ( those that can be found here, in comments ) and I'm still getting the same thing.

Any help would be really appriciated."

any solutions please?"
,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-10-27T01:09Z,"@policandru

I'm using a Logitech game controller... works perfectly.


I just wish someone would clarify if they've gotten past that one point in the game i described on the previous page, and how they did... because if no one has, then i think there's a reason this game is only 4.8GB's, most likely there is nothing past that point. Which would suck."

Well, let's say i was trying it, but as always, no one feels like seeding, so i'm downloading the same file here:

http://www.file*****.com/list/ACxc27A

Downloading from that site should get you the full game in a couple hours(change the stars to *serve*). When i'm done, i will test it out and let whoever cares know if the bug still exists."
