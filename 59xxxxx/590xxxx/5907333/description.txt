About:
Deca's second video probes into the depths of technical street skating. It contains sections from 
Marcus McBride, Luis Cruz, and Daewon Song among others, and is primarily shot in the Deca warehouse, 
which is a maze of high shelving, intense gaps, and forklift-aided obstacles. You'll hear mostly rap 
and hip-hop-esq tracks for the duration of the video, which lasts an adequate forty minutes or so.
2nd to None borders on utter absurdity, as it not only projects the most inane and insane technical 
tricks to date, but it portrays them occurring on rooftop gaps, 15-foot high shelving, and forklifts. 
Meanwhile, Daewon Song attains a new level of wizardry, as he is seen performing such variations as a 
nosebluntslide to 180 over a gap, into another bluntslide to 180 out or a nosegrind to nose manual, 
nollieflip out. Whether or not street skating can get any more precise, technical, and stylish is 
debatable, and if it were to ever progress beyond what Daewon Song has accomplished in this video, I 
would be speechless. Furthermore, this video is funny, and enjoyable, as it contains clips of office 
chair skating, a slo-mo "race" between skaters, and about 5 minutes of Song scaring the shit out of 
everyone in the offices with a rigged up dummy that pops out at passers-by.
