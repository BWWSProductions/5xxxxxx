Plot summary

In 1990, Johannesburg is home to a number of extraterrestrial refugees, whose
large spaceships (estimated to be nearly one kilometer in length) can be seen
hovering above the city. When the visitors arrived, the human population was
enamored with, among other aspects, the aliens' advanced "bio-suits", and
supposedly welcomed them with open arms. However, later, the aliens began
moving into other areas of the city, committing crimes in order to survive,
and frequently clashing with the police. Playing as a documentary, the film
continues, complete with interviews and footage taken from handheld cameras,
highlighting the growing tension between the civilian population and the visitors,
especially once the ships began to steal electricity and other resources from the
city.According to individuals "interviewed" in the film, the aliens were captive
labor (slaves or indentured servants), forced to live in "conditions that were not
good" and had escaped to Earth. Because the film takes place in 1990, while apartheid
was still in effect in South Africa, the aliens were forced to live amongst the
already-oppressed black population, causing conflict with them as well as the
non-white and white population.All of the interview statements which do not
explicitly mention extraterrestrials were taken from authentic interviews with
South Africans who had been asked their opinions of Zimbabwean refugees

Plot summary

Director Neill Blomkamp teams with producer Peter Jackson for this tale of
extraterrestrial refugees stuck in contemporary South Africa. It's been 28
years since the aliens made first contact, but there was never any attack from
the skies, nor any profound technological revelation capable of advancing our
society. Instead, the aliens were treated as refugees. They were the last of
their kind, and in order to accommodate them, the government of South Africa
set up a makeshift home in District 9 as politicians and world leaders debated
how to handle the situation. As the humans begin to grow wary of the unwelcome
intruders, a private company called Multi-National United (MNU) is assigned the
task of controlling the aliens. But MNU is less interested in the aliens'
welfare than attempting to understand how their weaponry works. Should they
manage to make that breakthrough, they will receive tremendous profits to fund
their research. Unfortunately, the highly advanced weaponry requires alien DNA
in order to be activated. When MNU field operative Wikus van der Merwe
(Sharlto Copley) is exposed to biotechnology that causes his DNA to mutate,
the tensions between the aliens and the humans intensifies. Wikus is the key
to unlocking the alien's technology, and he quickly becomes the most wanted man
on the planet. Ostracized and isolated, Wikus retreats to District 9 in a desperate
bid to shake his dogged pursuers.
