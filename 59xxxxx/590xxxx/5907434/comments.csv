On my 5.00 m33-4 it loads but when it comes to the menu screen it does not show the menus, any ideas why could this be happening?"
,drdre74,2010-10-26T05:43Z,Does this one have the movie clip stuttering issue? I've downloaded one from Klown and another site and they both pause and stutter like crazy anytime a cut scene comes on. Its to the point that it takes a normal 30 second clip to play at like 5 min and its getting on my nerves.
,NitrogenUA,2010-10-26T08:59Z,"ErickM, actualy, no ideas on that. Try disabling some 'agressive' plugins. Setting CPU frequency to 333. Also can suggest updating your FW, but it's up to you, and no guarantee it'll help. On the other hand - original source states that game must be playable on M33-6 and higher. Also using prometheus helped some ppl, but this image is already imbued with prometheus, so i dunno if this realy makes sense. Also, you can try to press Cross two times when you hear music started in menu. This will give you normal difficulty new game.

drdre74, i had problems like this and they were caused by non-original fucked-up Memory Stick. Cutscene image shatters and the console even switches off. Fortunately, i had another one - original card from Sony, so i've put game on it and it works like a charm. Not sure that this is your case, so you can also try to set your CPU frequency to 333, maybe it'll help.
Good luck, mates."

rohit2707, if speaking of prometheus patching - it can be done via Iso Tool. It is a PSP program for easy ISO-patching right on your console, and some other ISO manipulations. You can check it out.

,NitrogenUA,2010-11-05T12:05Z,"rugal2401, that's sucks. Then it seems like you won't be able to see subtitles even if i tell you exactly which buttons to press to enable 'em. The least i can promise - I'll look into it, but i doubt to find out much. But since you are not alone having this problem there are chances - problem will be ruled out.

Following shoutout goes to everyone having issues with this game!
Universal trouble-shooting guide:
1. If game does not launch, disable all you plugins, experiment with different 'UMD ISO Modes"", or/and ""CPU CLOCK GAME"" settings.
2. If game launches for you, but works poorly (low framerate, lagging videos) try setting your ""CPU CLOCK GAME"" to ""333/166"" - it surely drains battery faster, but it helped alot of ppl, including me.

Here is an example screeny for you: http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/9198/20101105125430.png - to get to VSH menu like this just press SELECT button while in XMB.

EndeW, what firmware do you use, mate?

ajdoms, i'm strongly advise you to update. And yes - you're right about the System Update feature - it will install original Sony firmware on your PSP, to avoid this you have to download a custom firmware of your choice from the net, put it to your Memory Stick, and launch it from Games menu. Good luck.

thekirkulator, i dont recall the place, are you still in a sunken Atlantis(River of Lament), or is it already a Death Domain?"
,EndeW,2010-11-05T12:37Z,Nitrogen: I have a 5.50 GEN-A custom firmware... Thanks.
,ajdoms,2010-11-05T18:51Z,Thank you NitrogenAU. But is there any specific site to download the firmware? im not really familiar with this stuff so i don't want to take a risk if im not sure on what im doing. Thanks again.

,NitrogenUA,2010-11-08T00:02Z,"EndeW, you'll probably benefit from updating firmware to higher version, 5.50 GEN-D3 for example. Since you are a first person in my knowlege, who tried that game on 5.50 GEN-A i dont realy have info about successful launch of this game on exact same firmware as yours.

ajdoms, http://www.psp-hacks.com/ will be nice place to start. You look for a custom firmware, for instance 5.00 M33-6 or 5.50 GEN-D3, or any other that suits you best. Good luck.

You're welcome guys. Have fun playing our favorite brutal spartan! :)"
,szhigen,2010-11-08T22:38Z,"Great work man!!! Love it!

,JIHUIN,2010-11-09T09:23Z,"@reborn10 & NeosMX:

To change the clock setting of your PSP just press the ""SELECT"" button and the VSH Menu will appear.
1. On CPU CLOCK XMB change the setting to 333/166 by pressing the left or right arrow key.

2. On CPU CLOCK GAME change the setting to 333/166 by pressing the left or right arrow key.

3. Now scroll down to EXIT and restart your PSP and try the game.

Now, if you can not enter to VSH menu even though you try pressing the SELECT button many times. You have another option to change the clock setting. You need to go to the Recovery Menu. In getting to Recovery Menu follow the instruction below:

1. Turn off your PSP first. It's much better you remove the battery and put it again to be sure that your PSP is in cold boot process.
2. Then press & hold the R Shoulder button while sliding the power switch to ON.
3. Now the Recovery Menu will appear. Scroll down to the CPU Speed by pressing the down arrow key and then press the X button to enter.
4. There you can see the ""Speed in XMB"" is set in default so change it by pressing the X button until you reach 333.
5. Same also in the ""Speed in UMD/ISO"" change it to 333.
6. Now go back to the Main Menu and scroll down to EXIT. Your PSP will automatically restart and try now the game.

Now, if the problem still exist, there is nothing much I can do to help you. 

You may try the trial and error procedure by inserting your memory stick with this game to one of your friend's PSP who has a CFW and compare the result. You may borrow the memory stick of your friend and try it to your PSP and see if it works.

That's all I can advice, and good luck...peace..."
,JIHUIN,2010-11-09T10:17Z,"By the way, I forgot to tell you how to disable the plugins.

1. Turn off your PSP.
2. Press and hold the R Shoulder Button while turning ON your PSP.
3. Revovery menu will appear in your screen. Scroll down to Plugins by pressing the down arrow key and press X to enter.
4. Now you can see all you plug-ins. Now set them all to ""Disable"" mode.
5. Go back to main menu and exit the recovery menu.
6. Try now the game if it works.

Hope this would help you."

ajdoms, it happens newer firmwares require certain firmware already beeing installed on your psp to be installed. Since your current firmware is pretty old you'll have to take one extra step then others. Gimme some time and i'll gather all you need to update. Standby.

nikgwapo, same problem happened to me when i was playing this game on non-original Memory Stick. Luckily i have another one MS which is original, and the game works fine on it.

Had the same problem. The menu text wouldn't show. Were you using this release? Is your PSP menu in a language other than english? if not change it to english (the lang of this release)

Looks like the text from the game is localizable so it will try to use the language you have set in the System config.

My GOW had spanish text only, so when i had the english lang set, it didn't show any text like menus (new game, load, etc). Then i changed to spanish an had text again."
,boogerkukaka,2010-12-27T12:27Z,"I still have a problem but i always solve it. When i am playing the game, sometimes it hangs then the psp turns off. I don't know what to do so then i tried to play it again and at the same time it hanged again in the same place. I found a solution for this. You just reinstall the game in your ISO folder. THEN BOOM. you can get past the place you hanged from. But my problem is sometimes it hangs in other place and again so i always reinstall the game. Any ideas? haha "

,oharaandrewlp,2011-01-05T04:32Z,"Changing the clock speeds and trying different ISO modes doesn't do anything for me.  Upgrading from 5.0 to 5.5 GEN-D3 did help the stuttering a lot, but it's still not perfect.  Cutscenes are a pain to watch, game lags when I enter a new area, and framerate isn't too good.  I'm using a 2 gig Sony Mark2 ms which is supposed to be really good.  Anyone have any other tweaks to share?"
,oharaandrewlp,2011-01-05T04:34Z,"And for me, using a fully compressed cso seems to work better than an iso."
,Veepee666,2011-01-09T01:46Z,"Game is running perfect on 6.35 OFW with Hen and Prometheus Iso loader.The problem is,no text in the game.I don't know what I'm selecting in th menue because there is no ''New game,Continue,option etc''
Same when I pause the game,nothing is written.
Otherwise the game is running fine and cutscene and there too.Any idea for this problem?"
,Veepee666,2011-01-17T15:17Z,"@577473 Thanks for the language setting changing help.
Guys if you have the same problem I had wich text in the game dosen't appear like the menu,change your language setting to english.Mine was in french so the game voices were in french with no text.Works perfect now!
Big thank to you NitrogenUA"

,1PotH3Ad,2011-02-20T17:01Z,"I'm running on CFW 6.35 PRO A-3, every game I have played runs perfectly.

Set the CPU Clock Game to 333/166
UMD ISO MODE - Sony NP9660
I disabled XMB, Game, and POPS plugins

Iso games run faster, if you have any .cso games convert them to an .iso with UMDGen 4.0 [http://www.psp-hacks.com/file/948]

You can also narrow down .iso files by removing extra padding in the games and by optimizing with the UMDGen program. "

Upgrade to 5.50 Gen-D final.
Then upgrade to 5.50 Prome-4.
You have to upgrade to 5.50 Gen-d final first, not the other way around!
Google them and you will find many walkthroughs."
