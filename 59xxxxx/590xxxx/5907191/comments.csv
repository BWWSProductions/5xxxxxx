[V],froggie100,2010-10-25T12:56Z,use vlc media player m8 to play the video!
,Kripnar,2010-10-25T18:33Z,"The video quality isn't too bad, sections are blurry. The sound, in spots, is so echoed that you sometimes have a hard time understanding what's being said.  The thing that displeases me most from this d/l is the fact that scenes are missing. I saw this in the theater on opening night and can honestly tell you that the ending has been completely removed from this download. If you base the movie from this download alone, you are missing out.  I rate this on 2 out of 10 stars.  Horrible effort."
,Monster_Dildo,2010-10-26T02:42Z,"Very Blurry, I Don'r Know If That Is The Movie Effect Or The Recording. Any Event, It's Hard To Make Out What's Going On."
