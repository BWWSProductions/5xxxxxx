Queen - Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy [Top of the Pops 1977].VOB



Very HQ tv show promo music video. "Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy" is the 
fourth single ("Queen's First EP") from an eighth track on the British rock 
group Queen's 1976 album A Day at the Races, written by Freddie Mercury. 
It was one of several British music hall-inspired songs written by both 
Mercury and Brian May that appeared on other Queen albums from the 1970s. 
The song describes how "a good old-fashioned lover boy" will 
romance with an unnamed love interest, especially at night.
The BBC version has drummer Roger Taylor singing Mike Stone's line. 
It was partially mimed by the band for BBC and aired on Top of the Pops.
