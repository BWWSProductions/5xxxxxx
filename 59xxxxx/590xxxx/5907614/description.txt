From info.tXt:
-----------------------------
This is a version of the movie with all
the "unnecessary" scenes removed to create
a shortened version.

Original runtime: 01:41:41
Shortened runtime: 01:03:43
Deleted scenes: 37:58

The purpose of these short versions of movies:
-Shorter runtime
-Boring movie (in your opinion)
-"unnecessary" scenes removed
-To match the runtime of tv-shows. So that it would feel like watching a tv-show or a short movie rather than a full length film.
