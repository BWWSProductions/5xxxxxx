,AJNorth,2011-06-01T01:29Z,"Among the greatest cinematographers of all time, Jack Cardiff, OBE, BSC, was one of the earliest to master the use of three-strip Technicolor. His cinematography for three classic films in a row by Michael Powell & Emeric Pressburger, ""A Matter of Life and Death"" (1946), ""Black Narcissus"" (1947) and ""The Red Shoes"" (1948) is nothing short of revelatory. If you have never seen them, some extraordinary experiences await you; even if you haven't, you may already know Cardiff's work from ""The African Queen"" (1951). This documentary is pure delight. Audio & Video = 10."
