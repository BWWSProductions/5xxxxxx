[V],thethingy,2010-10-21T16:38Z,what did it fall out off?
,yhalothar,2010-10-21T18:19Z,how can you repack this and still call it SKIDROW? :(
[V],Mbb15,2010-10-21T19:10Z,"where the fuck are you talking about, this is the official scene release"
,timbutdim,2010-10-21T20:08Z,I think yhalothar refers to a single RAR where as skidrow is a multi-rar. so either this is a package of the rar's or a package of an unpacked skidrow release. But if it does what it says on the tin then alls good:)
[V],Mbb15,2010-10-21T20:36Z,I unpacked skdirow release and packed it in a single rar I dont that with all my releases so it is easier to unpack :)
,damnlogin,2010-10-21T21:17Z,"There's alway someone who has to start complaining, stfu!! your getting it for Free ffs.

Thanks Mbb15 :)"
,BookieM,2010-10-22T00:17Z,"cant use packs, I clicked on caravan pack, and nothing happened...anyone know solution?"
,Salvi1234,2010-10-22T03:33Z,"BookieM. Did you unpack first? O_o
You need Winrar or 7-zip to unpack things.
Sorry if thats not what i meant but you werenÂ´t very specific :)"
,deepandhard,2010-10-22T03:50Z,"updated with no problems.  i noticed the new packs were added to my inventory without me having to preload the data files as stated in the nfo.

ty Mbb15 and Skidrow"
,Lednah,2010-10-22T04:38Z,Do this includes the hotfix for Update 1?

,viperstrikes,2010-10-22T05:40Z,"Hi, can anyone tell me if i need to put the original .exe files in the already cracked fallout new vegas game directory before running the update.Or this update will automatically take care of the game which I have already cracked. Thanks in advance for your suggestions."
,xcraze,2010-10-22T07:08Z,thanks

,SWEfriggeMS92,2010-10-22T11:50Z,THANKS Mbb15 FOR A GREAT UP! AND THANKS fook555 FOR SOME INTERESTING FACTS THAT I WASN'T AWARE OF!
,leezaal40,2010-10-22T13:49Z,Thanks for this update. Anyone know if this helps with the lag/stuttering issues ?
,SWEfriggeMS92,2010-10-22T14:53Z,Quests still don't seem to load as intended in the game.
,laitblade,2010-10-22T17:34Z,arent the dlc xbox360 exclusive?
,Lindane,2010-10-22T20:20Z,"@leezaal40
That is your computer, not the game."
,theRealKarmine,2010-10-22T21:58Z,"i run the game on a pent dual core e2200 2.2ghz with a radeon hd 5770 with everything on ultra (except for specular) and get at least 50 fps.

if you go to tweakguides and look up oblivion/fo3 tweaks and apply the dual core tweaks it should help.  i havent seen ANY stuttering with my comp.  i wouldnt mess around
with the config tooo much.  only the threaded options until someone comes up with a full guide.

also:
fForegroundMouseAccelBase=0
fForegroundMouseAccelTop=0
fForegroundMouseBase=0
fForegroundMouseMult=0 

put those under controls in your fallout.ini,
supposedly gets rid of mouse accel in menus.
everyone hates mouse accel so why inst this defaulted? ;/"

There's no need to go any where else. Anyone having quest script issues or loading time issues really needs to update FO, this will fix it. So, huge thanks to the owners and uploader for this content."

After you have mounted and installed the game you have to open the mounted picture, there's a SKIDROW folder on the CD with crack, just copy and overwrite the exe files into your installation folder :)
Happy hunting!"
,tizzay89,2010-12-13T03:55Z,"dunno if this is a fix for what im posting for but.
veronica companion qwest (i could make you care) on one gameplay round bugged her to the point of she could not follow me while i had her.  btw she is located at the 188 trading post near boulder cit nw i think. if u have her right from the start ( reqs u to play the game first to get a feel for where shit is. you will be able to level to 20 or higher within a day of easy gameplay.  

this time with her i did not complete (still in the dark) qwest and finished hers with out talking to the firing squad- just sniped them while hidden with the sniper rifle and she did not qlich. 


list of companions and there locations

ed-primm  nash home
rex- the king on freeside
cassidy- mojave out post
veronica-188 trading post
raul- black mountain
some doc forget his name lol - mormom fort freeside
lily-jacobs town
boone- novac reqs  night time only so just wait also he is time comsuming to get so heres a lil spoiler - the person who sold his wife is the lady who runs the no vac rooms.


played and beaten the game 3 times now on my forth lol.  awsome game and will def be buying since ide like to see a 4th come out.
