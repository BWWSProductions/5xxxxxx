,muLineZu,2010-10-27T03:55Z,The sound is microphone recorded! Some parts are spoken in spanish. Sounds like a fart in a can. My advice is to wait for a better copy...

All the dl out there are either Euro releases or cam-corder copies. Me, I'm gonna wait the two months and get a proper copy.  Don't bother to dl ANY copies till then."
