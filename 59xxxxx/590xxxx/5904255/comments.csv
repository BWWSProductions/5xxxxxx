thanks!!!!!"
,listenherenow,2010-10-27T12:52Z,"does this do the same things window washer does in xp 32 bit?   
  I have wondows 7 and my system is 64bit - operating and the pc.   

  looking for a washer I can set up for one click cleaning and empty space guttman like teh washer used to do on my old system. 

  I will do some research but I thought I would ask here anyway. 

  Thanks. "
,listenherenow,2010-10-27T13:00Z,"Ijust did a few searches and this software seems to not be for me. 

  if I had used it I would be bummed badley - 

  I think this is for noobs.   The old washer i was using was also for noobs But I liked it becuase I could set it one time. then just do a 1 click thing and get up from my system and not have to sit here and clean everything I wanted cleaned. 

  This here seems to do alot of stuff on it's own without input from the user. and that aint cool. LOL 

   Thanks anyway. "

[T],carter67,2010-10-27T22:46Z,"If you do decide to install this and you struggle to use it as I'm sure you will, please don't hesitate to contact me I will gladly help you understand the basics to properly use this sort of software so you don't ruin your pc...I often think folk with your level of understanding of the windows operating systems would maybe be better just leaving well enough alone, but as I say if you need some instruction just ask ;)"

This is a very good program and you're absolutely right, you can muck up your system with this if you don't PAY ATTENTION and know what your doing or how to un-do it.

It can be noob/listenherenow friendly but CCleaner may be more your speed.

Thanks for the up!"
