,amyadkins,2010-10-26T01:10Z,"@honeybunny28, I just want to thank you for all your hard work subtitling this show perfectly.  I am hard of hearing and being able to understand the dialogue is a godsend when there are so many good shows out there with bad or no subtitles!  Much love to you.  "

,CaptainFlowers17,2010-10-30T07:28Z,"good shit as usual.

i just want to bitch about how god damn predictable this show has become. you can see how his problems come from a mile a way
should have killed that ugly bitch 3 times by now"
,pilot234,2010-10-30T11:33Z,"@Rocco, wow, you're certainly the saddest bigot I've seen, your comments are as bland as your upbringing.And to name yourself after a guy who takes ass, you're quite the exemplary internet fag!
"
,pilot234,2010-10-30T11:35Z,"@CaptainFlowers- very true. I don't think they'll get as good as the first season,which in my opinion was the best. The 4th season was good though.Now it seems they're losing the plot."
,cheo2010,2010-11-02T01:58Z,Thanks a lot.
