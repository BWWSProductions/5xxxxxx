,Zosimos,2010-10-24T14:43Z,"Sometimes when I torrent a movie from anywhere, I click to play the movie, with Windows Media Player, of course. However, video plays fine, but the audio is a high pitched squeaking sound that would probably make my dogs go crazy if they were to hear it. Does anyone else have the same problem, and/or a remedy? Again, this is with most of my torrented videos. If I find one without the problem, I consider myself lucky. Help is much appreciated!"

,Zosimos,2010-10-25T01:09Z,"Nevermind, found my problem. Got rid of Windows Media Player, and using Media PLayer Classic. ;]"
