,Traziz,2010-10-24T23:25Z,"@Ddubzz - It is ok its the best one out there so far, but again it is only 2 days since cinematic release.

Sound is out of sync by a fraction of a second at times you can notice it now and again, the video is a bit blocky at times which is normal for a cam.

If your impatient then you should be fine with this, but if you want to highten your experience I would wait until a TC comes out, but these days TC's are starting to become rare, it usually starts with a cam then jumps to R5 Lines.

Give it a few days :)"
