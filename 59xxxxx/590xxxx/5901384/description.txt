Fourth album from incredible Los Angeles duo El Ten Eleven. Using loop pedals, octavers, & double neck guitars Kristian Dunn creates brilliant melodic music himself with only Tim Fogarty accompanying him on drums.

"It's Still Like a Secret" is fittingly entitled as this band has yet to truly blow up. But after you download this, promise you'll go see them live. You will NOT regret that decision.
