[T],rjordan21,2010-10-25T10:39Z,HMVinyl........Have you heard any PBTHAL vinyl rips?
[T],insinuendo,2010-10-25T12:53Z,"He's baaack!!!

PS My offer still stands :)"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-10-26T22:20Z,"@rjordan21 yeah I know about him, when I started I figured he was my only ""competition"" so I took my own style of uploading, hopefully someday I can get a homemadevinyl.com URL :D

@insinuendo Hey man, I'm having some trouble logging on to the server... I don't think it's the password or anything like that, it just can't seem to get on... I'll keep trying"
[T],rjordan21,2010-10-27T18:47Z,"HMVinyl,  you've heard OF PBTHAL but have you actually listened to any of his uploads?  Go to BTJUNKIE and download his ""Back In Black"" album. You should really listen to it.  I'd love to know what you think.........."
[T],insinuendo,2010-10-30T02:03Z,"HMV, Send me an email, I'll send the new pass.


IMO
PBTHAL rips are highly compressed files, not much better than CD rips. Check the vinyl rips I'll be releasing here...then compare :)

HMV rocks!"
[T],rjordan21,2010-10-30T08:30Z,"insinuendo,  ""not much better than cd""...really?  How do you listen to music?  with an ipod?  I've listened to your re-posting of other people's vinyl rips here.  The titles aren't the same but the equipment used is so much better....  HMVinyl's ""Back In Black"" isn't even the right speed... He (I'm guessing He's a He) spends so much effort to release vinyl on equipment that degrades the sound.  Irregardless of what it's ""appraised"" at.  If he listened to ANY of PBTHAL's rips (not competition...when did acquiring free music become a competition?) perhaps he'd be inspired to invest in some better equipment.....I'd rather listen to the 0's and 1's than most of his sub-standard grooves.  He seems passionate.....I'm just trying to give him some direction to see how much better vinyl can be. "
[T],insinuendo,2010-10-30T13:12Z,"To rjordan21:

First off, no...not an ipod, unlike you :) 

If you care to know...

When wanting to actively listen at home I play my music from my VAIO F Series laptop which is connected to my Denon AVR through HDMI cables which pushes the sound through bi-wired Paradigm Monitor 11 and ADP-390 surround speakers.

Secondly most of PBTHAL's work has a bitrate comparable to CD. His stuff is downsampled to 16-44, there's nothing outrageous about it. 


Here's a comparison between a shorter song by PBTHAL and a longer song done right:

[T],rjordan21,2010-10-30T17:04Z,"insinuendo, sorry about the ipod joke.  I'm really not trying to be rude.  Just educate you guys on what stuff should sound like or CAN sound like.  ""Garbage IN, garbage OUT"" is the phrase.... The bitrate used, sampling, conversion, etc means nothing if the source material is flawed. You can't fix it by just using a higher sampling rate!  Like I mentioned earlier go to BTJunkie and download PBTHAL's ""Back In Black"" and compare it to HMV's.... Just tell me what you think.  Try to ignore that HMV's table speed is wrong and the music is too fast.
Even here with Phil..... he sounds like he's singing behind a towel or has his hand over his mouth.  The instruments sound muffled.  Compare it to the CD and tell me what you think.  I'd say compare it to another viyl rip but there isn't another one out there!  That's why I'm spending the time here....HMV releases some great titles.  If he did some investigation and invested in a better rig (and no, he doesn't need to spend the +/- $2000 that PBTHAL did) the end result would be so much better for us all....
Happy Listening!"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-10-31T19:13Z,"FYI my Back in Black album is in terrible condition, I ripped it for the sake of ripping it, and not to start a huge compare war ;)"
[T],insinuendo,2010-10-31T20:13Z,"Maybe HMV isn't the best at what he does, yes there might be better rippers with a superior rig that have been at it for longer.

No, I haven't heard everything HMV's done, but one thing I can say for sure is that his Queen Greatest Hits is fab, regardless of what anyone says and that I hope he keeps at it :)"
[T],rjordan21,2010-10-31T22:26Z,"You're both missing my point......

Happy Listening!"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-11-02T11:36Z,always :D
