,nickhawaii,2010-11-02T10:23Z,"What the hell! I can't download the torrent, and yet there are 16 SEEDERS."
,deadspaced,2010-11-15T14:31Z,"Works fine, no idea what went wrong for FujiFlame, shpongles and nickhawaii.

Simultaneously one the most painful and hilarious experiences ever. This was not easy to get through, but I was laughing my ass off the whole way."

,Psycho817,2010-12-11T11:17Z,"The torrent on this site is corupt, and will need to be reuploaded.
Other torrent sites have it, and it's well seeded.

That being said this is one of the best Rifftrax, I really hope the guys do HSM 2 and 3."
,Psycho817,2011-01-02T11:30Z,"The guys at rifftrax MUST do HSM2 and 3. This one is just great, I laughed so hard I was gasping for air."

,jericho_cane,2011-11-07T07:05Z,I'll only upload BEAUTIFUL MIND if it has Rifftrax commentary. Otherwise forget it!
