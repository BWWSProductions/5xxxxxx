,saph27,2010-10-25T09:13Z,"Quality was ALMOST standard dvd grade. The sound was as little scratchy though. Used MPC and had no lighting issues.

I could not watch tho whole movie though... It was just too boring. Ill give it a 2 out of 10."

,martian_neighbour,2010-10-26T08:52Z,"Can somebody post a link for a English subtitle. One that is a perfect subtitle, not those translated by some Europeans."
,WagTheDog,2010-10-26T20:56Z,"Agree martian_neighbour. It is probably a wise decision if a bungler from the US would translate this to well kept english, instead of someone from England or the rest of the UK(!)"
,reghin78,2010-10-27T00:05Z,"arron255 gave it pretty bad marks (A:6,V:6).
From where I stand, the rip is one point short of DVD V and A. I wouldn't even ask for better quality."

This movie got RAVE reviews. This movie was GREAT. If you only like movies that have boobs every 2 minutes and have fight scenes every 2 minutes then of course you will hate this movie.

If you enjoy a real plot with compelling acting and a great story then you will like this movie. Go watch Robert Rodriguez movies if you want violence and boobs"
