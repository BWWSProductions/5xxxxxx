,dakota1000,2010-11-21T06:08Z,Thanks for sharing. It works fine except every time I try to view the Activity Guide and User's Manual it tries to install Adobe Reader 8. I've got a newer version and I haven't figured out how to view the pdfs. I'm hoping someone else has run into this problem and can help me out. Thanks in advance.
,thejagster,2010-12-19T23:38Z,You have to run this from the DVD (or use some virtual DVD program).  I burned the ISO it to DVD and it works fine.  Thanks a lot kostaspa!!!  Not that impressed with the quality of the software and definately think it's overpriced but let's give it a trial.

I bought their Deutsch Sprachkurs, when i was in Germany. It works well. I have a problem, when i played the tell me more program i accidently chose the euronews training files and after this when i try to use the program it says ""Impossible to asccess the lessons. Put the Tell Me More material into the intended location (DVD-ROM drive or USB drive). What can i do then.I  tried to delete te Iso and program and download it again to install it a new time but the same message comes up. I know you should not update rosetta stone because then it won`t work, im just afriad i did this with Tell Me More. Why has not anybody warned against this? Could somebody help me?
