Thank you for all the great uploads. Excellent work.

I have one request, though. 

I've been trying to find the cartoon series Heidi, for quite some time now.

Here is the wiki-link - 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi,_Girl_of_the_Alps

Could you please let me know if you can find the torrent or if you can somehow upload it?"

Heidi.COMPLETE.German.Anime.FS.Internal.DVDRiP.XViD-DOLLHEAD
Language: German
Subtitle: No Subs
Episodes: 1-52 
Format: XVID 
Size: 12 GB

I can send you as reply to your e-mail jdownloader's .dlc container for that."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-23T22:03Z,"@strmprpl: Found first four episodes - original Japanese audio with white English subtitles and 52 episode pack dubbed on Spanish, but unfortunately one episode is missing. All as direct-download."
,strmprpl,2010-10-24T05:55Z,Oh! English subtitles will be good. I only found a Portuguese dub.
