,deathtrooper30,2010-10-22T18:06Z,No RAR file thanx a bunch!
,777-200ER,2010-10-22T18:27Z,I get a Steam Error when trying to start the game launcher with this update. Already installed again but still the same problem with this update. 
,xiIix,2010-10-22T19:28Z,Does every game have to be broken when?
,xiIix,2010-10-22T19:29Z,... it's released.
,MorphzreaZ,2010-10-23T13:15Z,i got mine working without any of those updates.. no probs at all..try without updates just DLcs
,Reviewer,2010-10-23T15:12Z,So is everyone avoiding this update ? I've been reading on some sites that it fucks things up even worse. Any feedback from people who updated the Skidrow release ?
,Johnsun,2010-10-23T17:26Z,"The game still crashes as much as it did without the patch.  I have the latest video card, windows xp, and a lot of free space.  haven't the slightest idea"
,anakin73,2010-10-24T01:59Z,"Everytime I start the game, it crahses. no clue why."
,g0dsize,2010-10-24T03:59Z,"I don't know what's going on with other people, but after this update [I didn't bother with update 1, as it's included with this one], the game works just fine for me.  The DLC all loaded, saves all work, & after 4 or so hours of playing it today, I've not had a single crash, or even a glitch, for that matter.

If it helps, I'm running Win7 x64, an i7 860, and a Geforce 470GTX with the 260.89 drivers.  The game is set on ""Ultra"" settings with everything maxed out. I did update my Dx with the included runtime as the instructions stated.  Good luck & happy gaming."
,journe,2010-10-24T10:23Z,"@Godsize: how did you get directx to downgrade? I'm Win7 x64 as well, but try as I might I can't get the included version to install."
,journe,2010-10-24T10:30Z,"Huh. Never mind, seems I got the installer to work after all. If anyone else has this problem, the fix is stupidly simple...just run it in compatibility mode for XP >."
,syntexNL,2010-10-24T17:04Z,not trusted
,syntexNL,2010-10-24T17:05Z,i wait for Mbb15 or AItb
,g0dsize,2010-10-25T05:31Z,"@journe - DirectX won't downgrade. The directx runtime installer just checks your PC for needed DX9 files and adds them as necessary. 

Also, nVidia just released new drivers this week that fix a few issues with FO:NV.  They also seem to have fixed some crashing issues with FO3 [re-playing that before getting heavy into Vegas]."
,Farligsomfan,2010-10-25T23:23Z,Worked for me without any problems. 
,journe,2010-10-26T02:38Z,"Bah, this still hasn't got it working for me. Anyone else have the problem with the game crashing upon loading, at the bethesda logo, and/or know how to fix it?"
,6eye,2010-10-26T23:55Z,Works great thx skidrow. dont know where all the stuff came from but thanx. hey does anybody else get a slow down when there is a gun fight or just heaps of ai characters around?.
,AidyD,2010-10-27T14:06Z,"For anyone still getting crashes after installing this update - go to fallout new vegas nexus and search out the 'perf fix' mod.

It sorts out loads of tech problems, crashing, stuttering etc"
,flye,2010-10-29T11:19Z,"VERY BIG PROBLEM .
I VE installed tha game it starts normally, but when i see the main screen ( new game , options , contin... ) mouse and keaboard stucks there . PLZ HELPPPPPP !!!!!!!!! "
,sanitysama,2010-11-01T00:22Z,"don't download this trash. it breaks the game, shit won't even open now. skidrow sucks a fat dick."
,rpgn12,2010-11-03T07:06Z,"I downloaded this fix and it pretty fixes everything and includes all DLC specials

And I also apply my own personal fix to make the game compatible to my system

""Game Lagging / Stuttering From Direct-X?""
This is the same fix as the above DLL crash fix method. Some of you may not be crashing from not having this DLL, but instead may be suffering lag and game stuttering.

1. Download the dx9d9.dll: http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34778 (Nexus)
2. Put the file in your game folder"
,rpgn12,2010-11-03T07:09Z,"its not the patch issue /b/ros, its the game itself lol"
,koteman,2010-11-10T14:06Z,ty vm! working and now that silverlock finally made their script extender for FNV WOHOO! this patch was required for it to work :D yay modding!
,koteman,2010-11-10T14:09Z,and yes rpgn12's comment REALLY does help! my system is more than enough to play the game but its sad when it lags on such occasions as this game :P yes the dx file does trick the game into thinking you have an older vid card but its all the same once ur ingame. its performance is improved by over 200%! at least for me my system runs the game as it should with the dx9 trick.
,hairlesshairball,2011-01-25T02:25Z,"@flye

Unplug your xbox controller?"
[V],matimike,2011-02-04T02:06Z,thanks
,SilentK1ller,2011-04-20T18:05Z,Thank you uploader this works good!
,Aypolo,2011-04-24T23:44Z,"PLEASE HELP. I replaced the old data and exe's with the new, but now I'm getting:application load error:500000065434
I googled it, said I didn't crack the game? What?!"
