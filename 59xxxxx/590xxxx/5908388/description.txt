Well a special Meat Loaf dvd this time. A set of some of the finest Meat Loaf performances Live on tv in the 1980's.

First there is the Bad Attitude Promo gig at Channel 4's 'The Tube' from February 8, 1985.
Followed by Meat superb performance at the Elvis Tribute of August 14th 1987. Meat sounds fantastic during these songs.
