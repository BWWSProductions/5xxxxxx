Run Time: 87 minutes


Miles 'Dewey' Davis III, shot slightly prior to his ascent into dark magus period, here found in all his electric period glory. As something of a miles obsessive there's much to recommend here in a 2 hours plus wet dream for die hard fans. Peppered with incendiary footage, 'Bitches Brew', miles in bad strides, wicked and loud silk shirts, orange sunglasses, growling and glowering, trumpet through wah wah pedals and such other malarkey, theres also plenty nuff fascinating interviews with sidemen such as Herbie hancock, Keith Jarrett, Dave Liebman, Chick Corea and tributes from Carlos Santana, Joni Mitchell et al. This period reflected Miles growing interest in the works of Stockhausen, Hendrix and Sly stone, a mighty triumvirate and for our money his most inspirational and underrated material in the whole Davis canon. Culminating in the full 38 minute one track performance of 'Call It Anything' at the 1970 Isle of Wight, its still indisputably the coolest shit, the sound of improvisation mutating through fusion, rock, drugs, composition and cosmic inspiration.

Following the release of his controversial "Bitches Brew" album, Miles Davis appeared at the Isle of Wight Festival on August 29, 1970. Footage from the performance is included in this documentary that examines how Davis' groundbreaking fusion of traditional jazz and improvisational rock shook the music world to its very core. Includes insights from Joni Mitchell, Chick Corea, Carlos Santana, and others
