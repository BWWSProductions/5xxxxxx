Also,  great to finally have a complete Season One of X Factor.  We will try and keep these seeded until the end of this month but I see what you mean by people hitting and running.  There were 15 waiting for S01E14 Performances and we now have 6 total.

Thanks for coming back to seed this old series :-) "
