,Telmar3,2010-10-21T23:33Z,"2:32PM PST, No seeds, come on people, I have the original file ready for this fix! Pls seed!"
[V],Shroo,2010-10-22T00:25Z,"his is for those that still cant get the game to run



1: Go to my documents then to ""My Games"" folder then delete ""FalloutNW"" folder

2: Go to the folder where you installed the game and run ""FalloutNVLauncher.exe"" some messages will pop out just press ok and ok till you shut it down after that run ""Fallout.exe""
(at this point it seemd like it was going to work had a black screen going, but then it crashed) so

3: Go to where you installed the game open ""Regsetup.txt"" it should look like this 
======================================================================

REGEDIT4 

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Bethesda Softworks] 

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Bethesda Softworks\FalloutNV]

""Installed Path""=""%d""
======================================================================
Now change it so it looks like this:
REGEDIT4 

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Bethesda Softworks] 

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Bethesda Softworks\FalloutNV]

""Installed Path""=""%d""
======================================================================
When you done save it then run ""Reg.exe"" as admin 

Then run ""Fallout.exe""

At this point i was able to play the game 

If you get the black screen and then you get kicked to desktop try going to my document/my games/ and delete FalloutNV folder again 
then go to where u installed the game and run ""FalloutLauncher.exe"" and go through the ini not found bs again then close it and run ""Fallout.exe""
======================================================================"
,golabskii,2010-10-22T02:34Z,dude i installed it and everything and then the shorcut to fall out new vegas by tptb popped up and i click on it then it just shows me the option to install exit or... but its already installed
,superscooter143,2010-10-22T02:48Z,"Goddamnit. We're doing everything you say yet it's not working. I followed all the steps, did the fix, and it's still giving me the option only Install or Exit in the launcher or .exe.

Plus, I can't even start up the launcher thanks to editing that file you told me to edit."
,superscooter143,2010-10-22T02:55Z,"This doesn't work. I somehow got the launcher to work, but it doesn't work."
,superscooter143,2010-10-22T03:02Z,"Just sayin' your rips are great

but this one isn't :U"
,spiraloof,2010-10-22T07:22Z,"search regedit from start menu or run then
...go to regedit HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Bethesda Softworks\FalloutNV and dont forget to add ""\"" after vegas. you can do that by right clicking installed path and modify.it should work now, otherwise delete the FalloutNV from mygames & do the shroo""s fix instructios again.it should work now. by the way it's part of the fix shroo posted. i didn't do anything so i can't take credit for it."
,myers23,2010-10-22T10:51Z,"in regedit  i had to go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Bethesda Softworks\FalloutNV and put a
\
at the end of reg string.



mine looks like this E:\games\fallout New Vegas\ "
,myers23,2010-10-22T10:52Z,do wot shroo said 1st then do as i did
,tenspeed33,2010-10-22T15:26Z,When I run reg.exe as Admin it doesn't actually add the keys to the registry... any ideas?
,invader123,2010-10-22T16:42Z,plzzzzzzzzzz upload medal of honour 2010
,namezaka1,2010-10-22T17:16Z,"I can't get it to work. The reg.exe doesn't work, so I manually added the registry using notepad by exporting the one that was already in Wow6432Node, dragging it into a notepad doc, deleting the ""\Wow6432Node\"" and importing it.

No luck."
,namezaka1,2010-10-22T17:38Z,Is this going to get fixed or should we just get the skidrow release?
,Nikoza,2010-10-22T17:54Z,Install the newest update (Fallout New Vegas Update 2) and it should start to work.. atleast mine works now.
,namezaka1,2010-10-22T19:46Z,"Nikoza, did you do anything special before or after installing the update?"
,namezaka1,2010-10-22T19:51Z,UPDATE: I can CONFIRM that installing SKIDROW's Update-2 and copying the cracked .exes from that update will make the game work.
,myers23,2010-10-22T22:00Z,regestration is open at TeamTPTB over the weekend
