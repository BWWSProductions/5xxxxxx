Michael Winslow - Live

Michael Winslow "The Man Behind The Noises from Police Academy"

Michael Winslow (born September 6, 1958) is an American actor and a comedian known as the "Man of 10,000 Sound Effects" for his ability to make realistic sound effects using only his voice.


Michael Winslow is one of the funniest comedians of all time. Yes, this is the "The Sound Effects Guy " from the Police Academy movies, as well as a whole score of other places where he has awed and amazed audiences with his knack for endless sound effects (which all come from him!). He is absolutely unrivaled, and he is a great physical comedian, too.
This live show features some of his best impressions of a whole gamut of sounds from all over the place. Animals, electronics, music, vehicles, people - you name it, he can do it. No "probably" about it, even! He does the most incredible impressions of actors and musicians, though. From his ever-popular Jimi Hendrix, Tina Turner, and Led Zeppelin ones, to guys like Cheech & Chong and even Clint Eastwood...unbelievable. Michael Winslow is one of the most talented and unique entertainers out there, and not just for his 10,000 sound effects - his facial expressions and body movements are just as much a part of his usual trademark. And in this live show, he is at the top of his game.
