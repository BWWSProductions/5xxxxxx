,nargyriadis,2010-10-22T06:56Z,I hope this one works on my WDTV. Mad Max doesn't as well as a few others. The problem is with header compression (it comes as default in the new update of the software that converts to mkv). I will let you know. If it doesn't please stop using header compression when you create mkv files. Thanks.

,RPO1973,2010-10-22T18:23Z,And if you want to play the big 1080p files you'd better get a real media player. Know the limits of your gear.

try an older version of mkvmerge! 4.0.0 should work!"
[T],insinuendo,2010-10-24T23:46Z,"Make sure you set compression to ""none"" in extra options."
,einzelhaft,2010-10-25T19:12Z,...that didnt work for me for some reason!
