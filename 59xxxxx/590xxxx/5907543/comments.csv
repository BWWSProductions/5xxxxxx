,daba_1,2010-10-24T20:16Z,"On the classic 1972 live album Roadwork, Edgar Winter immortalized the words, when introducing brother Johnny: ""Everybody asks me...where's your brother?"" It's a question that fans have besieged both Winters with for over two decades, and now Johnny gets a chance to return the tribute with his latest. Edgar does in fact guest on the sessions, blowing sax and tinkling keys on a few tracks, and dueting with big bro on a superb, seasonal rendition of ""Please Come Home for Christmas."""
