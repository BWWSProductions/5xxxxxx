,ak_niko,2010-10-23T00:42Z,"Hi, is it the same as the Second Patch that was released on 21st?"
,Crissipos,2010-10-23T00:51Z,"So how does it work, first update 1, then update 2?"
,Crissipos,2010-10-23T01:42Z,nevermind! :D
,purplepopcorn24,2010-10-23T09:49Z,hey does anyone have any feedback on this update? i got the first update but i dont know about getting this one because the above comments said that it made it laggy and freeze during autosaves and such.. help me out here?
,Reviewer,2010-10-23T10:44Z,"@0bit

I had the same thing happen to me with the first update. The game froze when loading an auto-save, and I lost 3 hours of game play. Had to load a previous save and delete the auto-save. Complete bullshit, not sure if I want to update again. Is anyone else getting enemy players turning red when in cross hairs ?"
,DarkMerc,2010-10-23T13:56Z,"""You don't need to have any of the previous updates installed,
as this update is featuring all previous updated content''
And what about the 4 DLCs from the update 1?
Some people say that this update doesnt contains them...
anyways i have the 4 dlcs from OneUp :)"
,theRealKarmine,2010-10-23T22:59Z,why is this faggot kindergaten spamming every fallout thread with his stupid videos?  if you dont know to install a game you need to sell your computer and go buy a fucking crapbox 360.
,Cyrez60659,2010-10-24T00:22Z,This update DOES contain all four of the pre-order bonus packs and all of the new fixes. There is no reason to download Update 1.
,FiXXXeR135,2010-10-24T03:47Z,"What about the original .exes? Are they included in this torrent, cuz i d'loaded globe's release and he doesn't incl. them.   "
,g0dsize,2010-10-24T04:16Z,"This update fixed the save issues, and works fine for me.  Includes all DLC [installs with the installer - just be sure it's enabled in the game settings] and new exe's. Be sure to use the DirectX runtime updater included in the installer, as the game uses Dx9."
,mass_chaos420,2010-10-24T06:50Z,update ur drivers if u use nvidia card they add support 4 FNV fps jumped after
,remedy2,2010-10-24T14:11Z,"This makes loading problems even worse.  Every other game load results in a freeze.  Need task manager to kill process and restart game.  Before game issues were tolerable.  At least on my computer this update was definitely a mistake.  Great game though, a lot of gory fun.  I think I'll reinstall first version."
,syntexNL,2010-10-24T17:32Z,thanks again!
,patthor420,2010-10-24T23:03Z,"well with this update i can play for 30 min to an hour or 2 before it freeze's,so thank you for that because i could not even play for five min before this update,but it still freeze's, hope there well be an update 3 lol"
,Lucky13s,2010-10-25T07:17Z,"Why is this game so god damn choppy? The graphics are like the same as Fallout 3, and it runs 3x worse. Even if I set them to their absolute lowest, I still get such a shitty framerate."
,mcfcfan,2010-10-25T14:41Z,"Hi all i have a problem, I downloaded the game from AiTB including his update patch 2 both installed all fine even recognises the 4 add ons but heres the issue, i can start the games no problem even start a new character watch the opening cutscene all perfectly but when the first loading screen comes up its closes and comes up with, fallout new vegas has encounted an error and had to close, any ideas what i could do?"
,mcfcfan,2010-10-25T14:45Z,"Hi all i have a problem with this game, i downloaded and installed the game and patch 2 from AiTB and the whole thing went fine got into the game it recognises the 4 dlc content ok, but my problem is when i go to start a new game i can view the opening cutscene but then after it closes and shows fallout new vegas has encountered an error and had to close, any ideas?"
,inferna_hermit,2010-10-25T15:59Z,"Works for me Well , i play the game with GamePad and i don't have mouse problem but game runs smoother and frame problems reach it's minimum level"
,lolocar,2010-10-25T23:07Z,"@Lucky13s and everybody else with choppy performance, I had the same problem but it now runs better with the ""dll performance fix"" Google it.
(Note: there are 2 different versions for Ati and one for Nvidia, does not work on two moniters.)"
,Lucky13s,2010-10-26T00:40Z,"@lolocar
Ahh this is perfect, I also found a bunch of other fixes by editing the fallout.ini file to stop random crashes and huge slowdowns in random areas."
,lolocar,2010-10-26T02:04Z,http://forums(.)guru3d(.)com/showthread.php?t=330970 - reading the updated part I almost made fallout new vegas run completely smooth.
,boabman79,2010-10-26T12:49Z,hey mcfcfan.update your graphics driver .i had same prob as you update my drivers an hey presto the game worked
,1337Rundown,2010-10-26T14:59Z,"working without any problems

cheers~"
,teroan,2010-10-26T20:50Z,"Seems that the launcher is broken in this update. Vertical sync mode checkbox does nothing and after you update it using this it is forced ON.

To fix this, you need to have ""iPresentInterval=0"" in the ""Fallout_default.ini"" file (in installation root)."
,yelloo,2010-10-27T10:42Z,Thanks AiTB.
,Sroidi,2010-10-28T10:45Z,"@Lucky13s

,lolocar,2010-10-29T16:57Z,@flye maybe you have plugged in xbox controller?
,zeroblood00,2010-10-30T01:52Z,So like others before me i have the  application load error 5:0000065434 AFTER downloading this and have yet to see clear instructions on how to fix this and/or remove this update maybe im not looking right but help would be appreciated P.S. Step by step would be nice :)
,liviu89,2010-10-30T22:18Z,"my game always crash(no error msg,it just closes and shows desktop) after 10 minutes.
what can i do?"
,super-ted666,2010-11-02T12:29Z,"i managed to fix the 5:0000065434 problem by right clicking the dvd icon and opening with winrar,then just dragged the two files in SKIDROW to my desc top then drag them to the bethesda file in program files.u might have dll file probs just take not of the code and download them for free.just type them into a seach engine and should come up with loads of sites u can download them from.hope this helps as im a bit of a noob.steep learning curve! :-)"
,rpgn12,2010-11-03T07:12Z,"I downloaded this fix and it pretty fixes **Thx /b/ros.** everything and includes all DLC specials

And I also apply my own personal fix to make the game compatible to my system

Credits goes from: http://geekmontage.com/texts/fallout-new-vegas-game-fixes-crashes-audio-issues-lag-saving/

""Game Lagging / Stuttering From Direct-X?""
This is the same fix as the above DLL crash fix method. Some of you may not be crashing from not having this DLL, but instead may be suffering lag and game stuttering.

1. Download the dx9d9.dll: http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34778 (Nexus)
2. Put the file in your game folder"
,6eye,2010-11-03T11:04Z,Ive done that dx9d9 thing. it tricks the game into thinking you have a older graphics card and so the graphics and look of the game are not that good. im happy to have lag and good looking graphics and patience waiting till they get around to making all gpu's work with the game.
,rpgn12,2010-11-03T12:26Z,"wierd mine is smooth, may I know your specs? I'll post a vid on youtube"
,repetitiousous,2010-11-04T14:29Z,Can this crack and update be installed with the original game (DVD) or do I need to download the .iso ?? Why can't Skidrow make a crack that works on the original DVD ? Problem is that the original asks for internet connection for Steam when installing and that can't be bypassed. Maybe I need to compare the files on the .iso and DVD and copy what ever is different and try install that way.
,repetitiousous,2010-11-04T16:28Z,"I don't have internet connection at home. Suppose I can not activate on another computer and then install to ANOTHER computer that has no connection, cause you probably need Steam files and activation codes installed on the computer that you play. But steam won't install without internet connection. What a stupid system. Going to download the .iso and try that. I bought this game knowingly it needs the net and now I have to pirate it cause there's just no other way :-)"
,Drenaje1,2010-11-05T01:40Z,the game crashes after like 10 minutes and i have to ctrl alt delete out of it to close it. wtf is up with that?
,micnor14,2010-11-06T20:07Z,"Hows about one of you be a friendly pirate and tell us what version this updates to? Every commentor on this torrent before me makes me feel like I'm the only guy on the entire site that asks the important questions! 

Hopfully version 1.1.1.271 for use with NVSE???"
,micnor14,2010-11-06T20:14Z,"Well what do you know? 

I decided to risk my 24 hours of bandwidth downloading another horribly uninformative torrent and lucked in on this one. Friends, comrades, pirates; I do hereby confirm this the official 1.1.1.271 release. That is- it works with the beta NVSE by Ian Patterson, Stephen Abel and Paul Connelly. Seed on...."
,1994GiOVANNi2,2010-11-07T01:44Z,"I advise you people not to get this update, it messes up the loading time screen wallpapers causing the game to crash and also within the last 3 hours I had 2 crashes. Just wait for Patch #3 soon to be released!"
,aNate,2010-11-10T20:04Z,Works fine for me. Just waiting for patch 3 now.
,majorstrickland,2012-06-27T14:00Z,"lags a lot, and restarts every 10 mins hope this update fixes it"
