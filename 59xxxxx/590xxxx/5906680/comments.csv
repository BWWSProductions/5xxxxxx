,iamdabombman,2010-12-23T00:23Z,this has to be the worst movie i have seen in all my life.good download though.but this movie honestly truly is the worst
,ck.exe,2011-01-03T09:59Z,"People who are calling it worst have lost the plot. This is not Ronald Emerich's Independence Day with mindless action. You can relate the events in the film to the events that happened in District Six, Cape Town during 50s. And also to the Illegal immigrants' situation at US - Mexico border. The acting performances are so strong that the movie leaves a 'drama' kind of effect on the audience. Also, the perspective of the narration is exellent. Special Effects are cutting edge, and above all its the story telling at its best."

,MarkoOhNo,2011-05-12T02:30Z,Wow. There's just no excuse for visual quality like this. Horrible pixelation completely distorts the image throughout much of the movie. Ugh. Now I have to delete this & start all over with another. What a disappointment. 
,xplode196,2011-06-27T06:25Z,"I personally didn't like that there were no subs included in this one, nor was there a file to find online. Overall a great movie and rip."

[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2011-09-15T11:40Z,"iamdabomb youve totally ,missed the point & the plot-this is an excellent swipe at racism & apparthied.its not sposed 2 b a sci fi blockbuster like the awful independance day.brilliantly shot,direction fantastic,script perfect,cinematography great.you were looking for starship troopers m8-0bad plot,bad script,just bad all over=right up your alley! cheers for the up DJ "
,MrPanic1987,2011-09-20T12:46Z,"@iamdabombman  It's not a bad movie at all!!  Maybe it's not your type how they filmed it!
It has to look like a documentary and not like a cinamatic movie like Alien vs Predator and so on. and they did that very well!
It looks like it really happened and if it was really in the news!!  And not like... ""Ow  it's just like all other movies!!
This movie comes more close to reality than all other scifi/alien movies!
So keep your opinion for yourself and don't bother other people with it that have never seen this awesome documentary movie ;)
I have watched it 7 times and it still is THE BEST ALIEN MOVIE EVER!!!"
,MrPanic1987,2011-09-20T13:03Z,"And this movie show very clear how fucked up we people are!!  
If they would really land here.... I think this movie becomes reality!
I know how people and government are!
We will keep them here like in the movie....to get there weapons and technic!
This movie just shows what we are gonna do in the future if the aliens really land on earth!
Or kind of!  But the government will keep them here for the weapons and for ""reverse engineering"" of the ships.
Just google  ""area 51 and reverse engineering""
This movie is almost reality... so F*CK YOU iamdabombman and go watch AVP or something..... Not that AVP is a bad movie..not at all....   But it's soooooooo cinamatic and theatrical.. That that will be the kind of movies you like.... How Faker..How better for you right?
They really have to make a part 2 of district 9!!"
,MrPanic1987,2011-09-20T13:19Z,"@MarkoOhNo   What video player do you use?
I use the newest VLC player and video and audio codecs!
I'm still downloading this V10/A10 version of district 9... that 7 times that i watched this movie was in bad quality because it was a cam version.
I don't expect bad video quality from this torrent!
So I will let you know..... but I think it's your codecs or video player that takes the quality down."
,MrPanic1987,2011-09-20T16:09Z,"Ok... V10/A10 with VLC media player!
Great torrent... Thanks Deffjam555!!!
But one little problem for me.
I'm dutch..... so i downloaded dutch srt for it.
But i'll see the englisch subs also on the background.... how can I delete the englisch subs in the MPEG4 file??"
,RadiantB,2011-10-08T02:20Z,you can't remove hardcoded subs that are part of the movie

,okultus,2012-02-19T02:32Z,"How can anyone say this is a bad movie? Puzzles me o.O Granted not everyone likes the same thing but this is one of the best movies I've seen. Can't wait for sequel if they ever decide to make it..

Thanks for upload!"
,Confapulator,2012-03-20T08:07Z,Amazing torrent; quality and sound were superb. Also an absolutely amazing movie.  
,TheLittleRascal,2012-04-05T19:38Z,I have no idea why people are dissing this film. I remember seeing this at the cinema and absolutely loving it. This is a 4 or 5 star science fiction film. Damn awsome movie. There aren't many films that take science fiction as seriously as this. Thanks for the upload.
,eterna111,2012-04-08T23:40Z,"Correct subs for this rip: http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4510786/district-9-en
