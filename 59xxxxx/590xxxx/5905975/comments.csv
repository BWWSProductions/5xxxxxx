Not the greatest movie around but Douglas's speech at the univ. is great to watch. I imagine lots of daytraders are D/Ling this, interesting to note that they destroy the ""bad guy"" in the movie much the same way the waspy white real estate females in the flick do their biz: With rumors."
,RC_Ebooks,2010-11-01T12:53Z,"If you think about it, the whole premise of the movie doesn't say good things about the human race! Oh well, I'm stuck on this planet with the lot of ya too."
