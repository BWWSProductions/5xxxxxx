Meet the "Vinyl Underground" - three ultra-hip Londoners who solve crimes the cops can't even imagine.  Morrison Shepherd is a pretty boy ex-con, northern soul DJ and poker ace; Callum O'Connor, a.k.a. "Perv", is an autistic psychic with an horrific past; Leah King is a morgue assistant with a degree in forensic science by day, and internet porn-star and arsonist "Juicy Lou" by night.  Their first case: to exonerate the father of one of Morrison's old girlfriends who is on trial for an appalling cult murder!

Created and written by Si Spencer (Books of Magick: Life During Wartime) with art by Simon Gane (Dark Rain).  Spencer describes the story as "a love-hate story about the streets [of London] that shaped its characters, and that shaped its author."  Gane described the title as "scary, glamorous, fun, dark and articulate."
