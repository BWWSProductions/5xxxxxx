i must say you have a very exotic taste in comics. i love ur torrents for their quality and their rarity. one problem i do have is that most of ur old titles have virtually no seeds, why is it that some of ur followers are that selfish. Please,can you re-seed Curse of Dracula(dark horse)? i would be most grateful.Thank u for all ur freebies, for ur sacrifice"

I share soletar sentiments, excellent and rare scans. Pls seed your House of Mystery v1 collection for a short time, stuck at 99% over 48 hrs, no seeders!
In anticipation, very many thanks and keep up the gr8 work."
