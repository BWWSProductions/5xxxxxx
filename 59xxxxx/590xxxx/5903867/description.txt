Kevin Lewis never had a chance. Growing up on a poverty-stricken 
London council estate, beaten and starved by his parents, bullied 
at school and abandoned by social services, his life was never 
his own. Even after he was put into care, he found himself out on 
the streets caught up in a criminal underworld that knew him as 'The Kid'. 
Yet Kevin survived to make a better life for himself. This international 
bestseller published in 2003 is his heartbreaking and inspiring story.
