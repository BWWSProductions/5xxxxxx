Did you recheck torrent in your bittorrent client?
[Sacrianna]
Need update video codecs and filters (for ex. install or update K-Lite Codec Pack http://www.codecguide.com/)"
,Sacrianna,2010-12-16T17:21Z,"The codecs used in the episodes I can't play of Andromeda are the exact same codecs used in the ~100 other Andromeda files in your torrents that I can play, and fall within the domain of my cccp's capability, which is fully up to date, complete with filter tweaker to counter win7's codec assholery. Of well over 1000 files on my computer, theses are the only ones I cannot play."

,Keegen,2011-06-23T05:17Z,Great release! Works perfectly with Boxee Box as expected.
,deacon5,2011-12-31T18:58Z,an amazing show in great quality. i cant guess why all those leechers are waiting for the complete 1-5 all at once. i have already downloaded and watched them all before the other would even download. great job thanks.
,eNdEmiOn06463,2012-04-06T22:37Z,"Why isn't there a reasonable sized rip of this somewhat mediocre show out there? Who wants to waste 80GB on this show (or 37 for that matter, the other one with all the mixed episodes)? Have been trying for a week now to get it down to a more acceptable size. 

One batch converter made things choppy, an other got serious audio sync issues, problems with those annoying embedded subs. Why embed subs, especially English subs icw an English spoken show!? Let us be flexible and use separate srt files ok.

Think I've finally found a tool that does a decent job converting it to a more suited filesize of Âą175MB.
