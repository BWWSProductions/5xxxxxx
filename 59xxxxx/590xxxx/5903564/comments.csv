,miketheratguy,2011-08-11T14:22Z,"My only complaint is that the credits are removed (which, yes, I know you say in the description so I understood that ahead of time).

It's just that I can't stand having movies that have anything missing, including the credits- but more importantly, I often rip my own copies of movies to get the commentary tracks and those often continue on into the credit sequences.

I can't imagine that five extra minutes of video would be enough to screw the quality of the whole file, but I'm not a pro or anything so I suppose I wouldn't know. Just wish more quality small-size uploaders would leave the whole movie intact, even if I am in the minority on the subject."
,Nexdo,2012-01-15T23:31Z,Testing this movie now will tell you if it is good for the file size.
,Nexdo,2012-01-15T23:32Z,A/V = 9
