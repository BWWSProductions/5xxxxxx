Genesis - Mama [Bananas tv show 1983].VOB



HQ very rare promo music video from an outstanding and rare 1980's tv show 
from Germany, broadcasted from 1981 to 1984, this is practically unknown 
in America, but this show has very well known artists of the 1980's. 
The rarity of this show is that, all the appearances of very well known guests 
are a whole new promo music video production that easly could be considered as 
never seen before videos or second versions of several classic 80's videos.

"Mama" was the first single from Genesis' 1983 self-titled album. Instantly 
recognizable from its harsh drum machine introduction, which leads into 
minimalist synthesizer lines in minor keys and finally Phil Collins' 
reverb-laden voice, "Mama" serves notice that the album which follows will be 
considerably darker than previous efforts. The song's theme involves a young 
man's longing for a particular prostitute. It remains the band's biggest 
commercial success in the UK, reaching #4 on the UK Singles Chart. It also made 
the top 10 in Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Ireland and the Netherlands. It was 
less popular in the US, only reaching #73 on the Billboard Hot 100.
