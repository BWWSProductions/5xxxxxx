Taken from the release announcement.                                       What is Ultimate Edition 2.8?  Ultimate Edition was built off Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat.  All updates fully updated / upgraded.  The software you have came to love with previous editions of Ultimate Edition have been also pre-installed along with 12 new ones.  I must apologise at time of build Cinelerra & wine doors were currently broken and did not make the cut.

    I also want to apologise for the delay and at the same time thank my admin for the delay of Ultimate Edition 2.8â€²s release.  Many issues have been squashed in 2.8 because of the delay.  I do want to give a shout out to JohnnyG. Many were cosmetic, he has a real eye for detail and breaking things down to a programmers level.  Thanks again JohnnyG.  Cowboyâ€™s handiwork at the theme has won the poll and will be deemed â€œCowboy Blueâ€.  This is not the end of the thanks that need to be dropped simply the tip of the iceberg.  I would be chatter boxing all day to give the kudos where they lie.  No, I do not do everything.  Donâ€™t like the blue theme?  There are 107 themes to choose from, it does not have to be dark.
