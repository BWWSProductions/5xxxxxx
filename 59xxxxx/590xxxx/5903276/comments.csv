,dely8,2010-10-24T17:27Z,This rip is fucked up. At about 29m 40s the screen freezes and after a while the movie starts over again at the very beginning but this is only the picture. The sound (and the subs I downloaded my self) continues like everything's fine. What's up with that? Is it just me or?
