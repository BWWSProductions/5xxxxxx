,cobra666_millenium,2011-01-13T13:32Z,"So... Can't anyone provide a crack for Kaspersky Pure ?
I mean ...I've downloaded iND torrent and followed the steps , so, now the 30 days trial key is now a 3702 days ""trial"" key ... meaning I have activated Kaspersky Pure for 10 years (from 8 jan 2011 untill 8 jan 2021) ... but it's really annoying because from time to time the following notification appears: ""You're using a trial key. Please purchase a commercial key... bleah bleah bleah...yadda yadda yadda..."", even though i've selected: ""Hide this notification""... I mean, I know that this doesn't affect be from enjoying the full functionality of the antivirus, but this notification just annoys me ... I don't know why !!!"
,lkshark1,2011-01-22T21:03Z,"@ThumperTM - you ROCK!
Working on XP and 7 for several weeks...no problems!"
,hehaaw,2011-01-29T13:14Z,"well it seem the link is broken, and my browes doesnt seem to able open the magnet link"
,rcnsit,2011-02-02T09:18Z,"Yes,link is broken."
,Tatletz,2011-02-12T21:10Z,"Something went wrong, after one of the regular updates the license was blocked. Tried to repeat the activation proces with no success. It was fine for few months but not any more : (((("
,lindi070,2011-02-13T01:10Z,"Mine got blocked too, but I found a solution. Again, delete your licence from the red X, and after that do the crack steps once again. Thus,
1) Delete licence
2) Stop Self-defence
3) Exit Kaspersky
4) Get offline
5) Apply the crack
Voila!"
,Tatletz,2011-02-14T07:49Z,"@lindi070:
1) Delete licence
2) Stop Self-defence
3) Exit Kaspersky
4) Get offline
5) Apply the crack
True, but it has to be done after each reboot. Just too annoying, so I removed KIS and installed BitDefender 2011 with a simmilar crack and so far all is good."
,mandipdas,2011-02-14T19:55Z,"Here is the solution to the activation problem after each reboot. All you have to do is, install the crack (as per instructions) and after all that when your product is finally activated, just change the permission of the ""Kaspersky Internet Security"" folder before reboot/shutdown. Just follow the steps,
1. Right click on the above stated folder.
2. Go to the Properties.
3. Go to Security tab.
4. Click Advanced.
5. Click Change Permission.
6. There may be 3 or more lines, so select every line one at a time and click Edit.
7. Now check 2 boxes under the Deny section called ""Delete subfolders and files"" and ""Delete"".
8. Do the same for every line and click apply and ok as required.
That's all folks, now Kaspersky just can't delete anything from that folder neither can you until you revert everything to default. So, No more crack applying.
I hope it helps you all. Peace.

,PimpstiN,2011-02-15T07:18Z,"@ mandipdas, will this be the folder in the program files win xp? i did right-click on the KAV folder, properties, but there is no security tab. im stuck. pls help!"
,lindi070,2011-02-16T18:35Z,"@ mandipdas
Can you please give some more accurate details for applying these steps in Windows XP? Because there is no Security tab, whatsoever when I choose Properties."
,lindi070,2011-02-18T17:46Z,"@PimpstiN
You need to right-click only on fltlib that is inside the Kaspersky folder."
,lindi070,2011-02-19T12:09Z,"It seems Kaspersky again found a solution and blocked my licence. But again, Kaspersky is still working, but only updates are not working.
So, I will repeat the crack procedure every week in order to update it, then I won't care if my licence will be blocked because the software is still useful."
,oatgarum,2011-03-26T10:49Z,thanks for this crack.... 
,oatgarum,2011-03-26T10:53Z,why...No input file specified....
,crackertheultimate123,2011-04-12T11:05Z,"It does not work key is blocked
But Thumper yr awosum"
,md_arefin,2011-04-28T12:39Z,"Hey all?? This crack is actually blocked by Kaspersky.
But solution is still there.
This crack actully adds a file 'fltlib.dll' to C:\Program Files\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 2011\
You just have to add the cracked fltlib.dll file to Exclusion before it is blocked.
If you don't know how to do it then read below:

Install Kaspersky Internet Security First.
Active later
Disconnect to Internet
Disable self defence
Exit Kaspersky from taskbar
Run the crack
Either it will be activated for 3700 days or there may be notice that invailed licence date. Dont worry. Don't reboot.
Go to setting>Threats and Exclusion
Click on the Setting[Exclusion]>Add>sellect object
On the box, type C:\Program Files\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 2011\fltlib.dll
Ok
Beside Exclution rulse, click on Trusted application>Add>Browse
In the file name, type the address C:\Program Files\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 2011\fltlib.dll
Open
A dialogue box will be appared and click on all
Ok
Now the crack file C:\Program Files\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 2011\fltlib.dll won't be blocked.
Now reboot/restart your PC. You can now Update and your key wont be blocked.

If the crack is still blocked then try the above process again.
Ohho you should also do the same for Kaspersky 2011 Crack.exe file what you did for fltlid.dll file So that Kaspersky dosen't delet the crack software Kaspersky 2011 Crack.exe as a Hacking tools/malicious software

,Gryphes,2011-06-25T21:12Z,It works actually but Now KIS doesn't start when system starts.
