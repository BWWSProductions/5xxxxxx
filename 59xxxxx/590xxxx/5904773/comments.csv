,ineedtonutt,2010-11-08T15:58Z,"If you downloaded this copy and couldn't save game after updating and copying the crack over the originals  like I did then search google for xlive.dll. read about it. download it and put it in the same directory as the game's launcher. Enjoy. 

Thank you much to the uploader. I have only started the Lost And Damned and it is cool as hell! With every new GTA comes new and exciting features. I should have already bought this for ps3 but it is running great on my intel i7."

,Craven_Darkshadow,2011-03-05T03:15Z,after playing a while there seems to be a problem with the game keeping accelerating and when you get on the bike/car its almost destroyed and the camera is shaking
