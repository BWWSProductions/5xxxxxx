http://www.divx.com/

It's not hard really.  And if you insist on not having a ""divx"" file, rename it as an AVI.  They're the same thing."
,loslocos1981,2010-10-23T20:42Z,Thanks for this! The series is going to be fucking epic!!
,Lirix1g,2010-10-23T21:00Z,"Thx,

Was expecting much more for this tv show.. too bad"
,dracownsu,2010-10-24T08:14Z,"I fucking love you.

This is epic."
,dracownsu,2010-10-24T08:16Z,"By that I do mean 


THANKS!!!!!!!"
,dracownsu,2010-10-24T10:23Z,"Just finished, 100% working and well worth the watch if you cant wait for 31st showing. 

This is a fucking awesome start to what will be the new best show on TV. No doubt about it. Follows the comic SO well where it needs to and changes a bit where it doesn't. This is going to be a great year for AMC.  

Remember to watch it on TV if you can so they make A LOT more of this.  This is one I personally am adding to my DVD collection day one. This show is freaking out of this world. And the gore for a TV show is UNBELIEVABLE! 

THANKS FOR THE UPLOAD!"
