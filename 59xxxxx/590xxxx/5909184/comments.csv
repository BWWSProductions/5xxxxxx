,barnabee18,2011-04-03T20:54Z,"OK...so from what I've read on other torrent sites, this was a poor rip resulting in cropping, but hereâ€˜s the part I canâ€˜t figure out. I downloaded this and at first, it played perfectly at the correct aspect ratio. After seeing it, I thought it would be great to watch with my wive (big glee fan, not so much a porn fan) but the .mkv 720p HD version didnâ€˜t work, so I figured Iâ€˜d try to upgrade my CODECs, only when I did this, did the cropping problem surface on this version. Unfortunately I used a CODEC pack, so I canâ€˜t pinpoint the problem, but since it worked before, there has to be a fix. So...are there any video techs out there who can tell us the fix?"
