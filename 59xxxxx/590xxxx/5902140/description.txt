Product Description
In the summer of 1996, inside a sweltering singlewide trailer outside a small Kentucky mining town, an unknown sing/songwriter named Chris Knight recorded an 'unofficial' batch of tracks prior to the release of his major label debut album. Over the next decade, through a combination of leaks, bootlegs and legend, those sessions would become something much more. "People have been talking about these tapes ever since I recorded them," Chris Knight says. "To me, they were rough and stark and I never thought they'd see the light of day." Ten years and four acclaimed albums later, The Trailer Tapes remain a remarkable moment in time, less captured than cornered, a portrait of the artist as a ferociously talented young man. And for the artist The New York Times would soon call 'the last of a dying breed...a hard-nosed iconoclast with an acoustic guitar and a college degree," The Trailer Tapes have now arrived as the long-long missing first chapter of one of the most uncompromising careers in music today.
