NOTES
VIDEO:Alpha & Omega 2010 R5 VOBS relizlab .................Thanks ELEKTRI4KA
AUDIO:Alpha & Omega Audio ....................Thanks LKRG

The audio... took the cam audio from our cam release and synced it to the R5 encode... for the ending i stripped the russian audio for that so the audio would be complete. There are two small spots in the middle of the movie that have spanish audio as there is no other english audio out for it... :wink: For the video we wrote a script to lower the chroma, increased the sharpness, make it brighter and also a rgbeq filter to correct the colours.

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
