The legendary war of Troy was fought by Menelaus, king of Sparta, and Paris , prince of Troy. The war was caused by the kidnapping of the beautiful Helen, whose visage "made thousands of ships to set sail". Are those truly happpened events or a literary fantasy? Did the city of Troy actually exist?
Troy and his legend remained a mith for centuries, a place narrated by an ancient greek poet, Homer, in his epic poem, The Iliad. Historians believe that the Troy events are much more than a gripping story.
We'll follow the fascinating events of the discovery of the site of Troy, spotted in the XIX century by archeologists in North-Western Turkey: the story of an adventurous research, during archeology early times.
