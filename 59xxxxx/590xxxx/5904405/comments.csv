I've been waiting a long time for this film to be released on BluRay and it looks spectacular.

One issue though (although it might be just me).  The video seems to have some frame rate issues.  Several times during playback the frame rate seems to skip a frame.

I extracted the video/audio tracks and remuxed them using 24000/1001 and that seems to have fixed the problem.  This is not the first time I've come across this problem so it could be a bug.

I just wanted to let anyone know who's having the same problem to extract and remux the video at 24000/1001 and you should be good."
