I have been trying to install the game all day, and every file that I have tried is either corrupt, or is missing files, has no attachments to the game itself.
Please let me know if this works, and if you can actually play the game. 
Thanks."

,kaotic_drake,2011-04-13T03:21Z,"I don't know what the problem is but for some reason even though everyone speaks English, the subtitles are in English all the items appear in English, etc. I'm a the vigometer and all the text is in Russian or something. Has anybody else had this issue, and if you have can you tell me how to fix it?"
