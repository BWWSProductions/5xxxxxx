    The highly skilled Federale Machete is hired by some unsavory types to assassinate a senator. But just as heâ€™s about to take the shot, he notices someone aiming at him and realizes heâ€™s been set up. He barely survives the sniperâ€™s bullet, and is soon out for revenge on his former employers, with the reluctant assistance of his old friend Cheech Marin, who has become a priest and taken a vow of nonviolence. If you hire him to take out the bad guys, make sure the bad guys arenâ€™t you!
