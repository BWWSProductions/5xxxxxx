,EpicSkye,2010-11-18T21:21Z,"I also have Windows 7, so what I did was that I right-clicked on the icon in the desktop, and one of the options that comes up in the menu is ""Troubleshoot Compatibility"". Click on that, and you'll get two options to fix the problem. I clicked on the recommended option, and it fixed it."
