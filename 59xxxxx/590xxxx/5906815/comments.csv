,globalpuffer,2010-12-14T04:18Z,"I dont get people complaining about 128.. if you have a system capable of playing an mp3 so well you can tell the difference (which I have neer been able to do myself) then why are you here complaining?  Go buy it or something and ""quit yer bitchin"".  Personally, I am sick of the huge 320's.. they are defeating the purpose of the MP3... which is small size and totally decent sound, which you get with a 128.. This is a perfect offering IMHO.  Thank you gibsonman!  +1 to quality from me.  :)"
