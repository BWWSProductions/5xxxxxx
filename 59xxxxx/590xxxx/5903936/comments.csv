,sickrthanothrs38,2010-10-28T05:36Z,little blurry at times V:7 A:5 it's watchable
,Lunar_Knight,2010-10-28T08:09Z,"I have to agree with sickrthanothrs38. A little fuzzy in places, but still very watchable. V/7 A/6. Would've rated the Audio a 7 but it gets tinny at times. For a CAM, top notch."

,was192,2010-11-24T21:17Z,can u please upload dvd
,watbol,2010-12-29T05:43Z,"Typical CAM, audio-5 Video-7
Voices echo a bit more than I expected.
All in all, Very Good, Nice 16:8-WideScreen movie.
Keep up the Good Werk¡!
