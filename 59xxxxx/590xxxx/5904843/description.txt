Biology of Marine Birds provides the only complete summary of information about marine birds ever published. It both summarizes and analyzes their breeding biology, ecology, taxonomy, evolution, fossil history, physiology, energetics, and conservation.

Two summary chapters address the biology of shorebirds and wading birds and their lives in the marine environment.
