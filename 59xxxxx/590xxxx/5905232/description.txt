Overview:

***** High Quality Photo Enlargement
Here you can resize images maintaining quality, edges and texture. This means Reshade reduces or eliminates most of the usual side-effects of photo enlargement:
# pixelation: visible square pixels in an image
# loss of focus: blurry / out of focus image edges
# loss of sharpness: reduced edge contrast
# exagerated noise: random pixel values, stains

Usually in image interpolation there is a tradeoff between sharpness and blur. If you want to remove blur and maintain sharpness you get pixelated and noisy images and vice-versa. Reshade balances as best as possible the 4 factors offering quality photo enlargement that maintains all the details in the original image at the same time.

***** Advantages of using Reshade over other image resizers:
# works at all zoom levels: other professional resizers have only specific ranges (1-4x, 3x-5x etc) where they work right
# highest accuracy: even the finest textures in the original image are preserved (best forensic photo enlarger)
# doesn't lose photo realism: other resizers smooth the image too much in the interpolation process
