David & David was an American rock duo composed of Los Angeles-based studio musicians David Baerwald and David Ricketts. They were best known for their debut single "Welcome to the Boomtown" from the album Boomtown. The single reached #37 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1986 and #8 on the Billboard Top Rock Tracks chart.[1]

Boomtown was produced by Davitt Sigerson. It peaked at #39 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold in the U.S. by the RIAA. The followup single, "Swallowed By the Cracks" reached #14 on the Billboard Top Rock Tracks chart, while "Ain't So Easy" peaked at #51 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #17 on the Billboard Top Rock Tracks chart.

David & David disbanded shortly after Boomtown and Baerwald and Ricketts continued to work with other musicians. They both collaborated with Sheryl Crow on her debut LP, Tuesday Night Music Club.
