i followed steps shown in these comments .. i will post them again for people who for some reason dont search the comments for help first .. 


1 - install the game ( it will be german setup but we will change it to english )

2- Go to START - RUN - type REGEDIT 

3 - in REGEDIT go to EDIT - FIND and type in ( or copy and paste this - FarmingSimulator2011DE_is1 - Once you have found it RENAME it To FarmingSimulator2011EN_is1 - Exactly the same just the DE was changed to EN

4- Download and apply a patch everyone is saying 1.3 - 1.4 ... theres both German And English .. Download the english Patches !! easily found on google ! ( you can try using latest 2.0 patch but i 1st used 1.4 patch then updated to 2.0 .. might work straight away with 2.0 tho i didnt try it that way so i cant say ) 

5- once you have applied a patch download Deamon Tools .. Again google it or download off this site .. 

6- Once downlaoded open Deamon Tools - Install - And Run Program .. On Deamon Tools click ADD IMAGE - then go to where u saved this torrent as the image is this file you have downloaded from here ( the ISO file ) 
once opend you can go to my computer and there you will notice a new tab where the CD drive option is .. 

7 Click the New tab and there you go it WILL run if you have done all this correctly and yes it will be in ENGLISH too .. 1st running the game it will not ask for a serial key - the second time it will and i used - 

RLDST-FRM7J-DHYAR-M8KF7-MD9DR


Deamon Tools Has To Be Used Or Something Similar As There Is No Crack Yet

Explained As Noobish As Possible .. Installed Fine On Mine Using Windows 7 x64

,Maffia_Revenge,2012-03-24T21:43Z,"Thanks! 
I folow the next steps, and this works!

1 - install the game ( it will be german setup but we will change it to english )

2- Go to START - RUN - type REGEDIT 

3 - in REGEDIT go to EDIT - FIND and type in ( or copy and paste this - FarmingSimulator2011DE_is1 - Once you have found it RENAME it To FarmingSimulator2011EN_is1 - Exactly the same just the DE was changed to EN

4- Download and apply a patch everyone is saying 1.3 - 1.4 ... theres both German And English .. Download the english Patches !! easily found on google ! ( you can try using latest 2.0 patch but i 1st used 1.4 patch then updated to 2.0 .. might work straight away with 2.0 tho i didnt try it that way so i cant say ) 

5- once you have applied a patch download Deamon Tools .. Again google it or download off this site .. 

________________________________________________
6- Once downlaoded open Deamon Tools - Install - And Run Program .. On Deamon Tools click ADD IMAGE - then go to where u saved this torrent as the image is this file you have downloaded from here ( the ISO file ) 
once opend you can go to my computer and there you will notice a new tab where the CD drive option is .. 

7 Click the New tab and there you go it WILL run if you have done all this correctly and yes it will be in ENGLISH too .. 1st running the game it will not ask for a serial key - the second time it will and i used - 

CD KEY: RLDST-FRM7J-DHYAR-M8KF7-MD9DR

ITS WOKS!!!"
