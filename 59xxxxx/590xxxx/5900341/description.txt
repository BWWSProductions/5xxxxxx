AVERT is a simple and free tool to help in the removal of malware. Version 2.1 includes support for 8 portable scanners and 1 installed scanner.

AVERT is a tiny download initially. You then use AVERT to download the portable scanners you'd like to use:

Asquared
ClamWin
Panda
Avira
Trend Micro
Vba32
Sophos
VIPRE

The only installed scanner, for now, is AVG. If AVG is installed, AVERT can use it along with the other scanners to scan your machine.
