[T],CODYBOSS1969,2010-10-21T22:06Z,Error -5: Not enough memory for (de)compression !!???   I thought 2gb DDRam on WinXp it's enough and 40 gb free HDD space... [Image mounted on UltraIso virtual drive].The processor and the videocard are on ....the edge[ minimum requirements]....but still...why does not work....at least the installation ??? I'll try it on another and better  machine.. Cheers to re-packers and up-loader
,rocco_sifredi,2010-10-21T22:53Z,Does that work or not?? I'm sick of those LOSERS who make an upload which doesn't ..READ MY LIPS....WORK!!! Got my drift?;)
,punkydoo,2010-10-23T07:00Z,"It's not working...it takes around 2 hrs to install and when u launch the game it shows an error..
i have 4gb ram ddr3 , 1 gb graphics card ati hd 5650 , i5 processor, win7(64-bit)... so im sure its not a graphics error!!!!"
,N4o7A,2010-10-24T06:08Z,"It works, however it scared me when my anti-virus said it was a trojan (it's not). As for getting it to work...just install it and play it on Direct 9x not 11 (I tried 11 but a msg popped up, forgot what it was.) I have a question however, while this game does not require a product key to play, which is interesting enough, you can't save the game without a profile that has the product key thus meaning you can't save....I mean unless someone has figured it out I'm lost"
,MP7560,2010-10-24T07:52Z,"I think you're supposed to make a local profile. It should be one of the options when you make a new profile, just scroll down or something. "
,tops.c,2010-10-24T15:38Z,"This worked for me XPsp3, I used this crack;

,tops.c,2010-10-24T15:41Z,"Don't have a clue as to what is the goal in this game, I think it's just kill a bunch of critters to save the world."
,N4o7A,2010-10-24T21:45Z,"Thanks MP7560, didn't see that create local profile thing lol. Also what is the crack suppose to do? I mean would enable me play online (which I highly doubt but would be nice), cuz playing the AIs is uhhh....well let's just say they aren't the smartest bunch around"
,dahamburgler,2010-10-25T18:33Z,"ive got the other one to work if anyone gets it to work come play system link with me on hamachi

,adventurjunky,2010-11-14T16:01Z,@Ragina1 yes it works but you cant save your progress as far as I know.
,boarding546,2010-11-15T06:27Z,"I've played like 25 hours so far.  Great torrent and game.  I had a glitch where the game crashed.  An update of my graphics card drivers solved that.  Everybody thank mixtorrent!
You can save your progress.  Make a Microsoft Games account to save.  Set it on Local.  I believe this torrent comes with Microsoft Games software. "
,Ragina1,2010-11-15T16:42Z,"GUYS,BIG problem .the game installed fine,but when i launch the game in dx9 it says the program has stopped working.I use windows vista.here r my system specs:
2gb
Intel Pentium Dual core 2.92ghz
nvidia geforce 8400gs 512mb"
,OneHitGamer,2010-11-16T18:18Z,"For those of you who cannot figure out how to create an offline profile:

Go to CREATE NEW PROFILE, on the USER AGREEMENT screen, DO NOT press NEXT. instead, scroll down to the bottom and in the LAST PARAGRAPH you will see a blue link label'd ""CREATE OFFLINE PROFILE. click that. done.

Now you have an offline profile and can save your game progress. this is why some of you cannot load your save, cuzz it didnt exist lol.

,Tataen89,2011-05-09T01:42Z,"Тут вижу не только английский ну и русский перевод вроде лост,вот тока одно в этом релизе не так,пишет что сохраняется а на самом деле нет,так что лучше весь день в запасе иметь если кто из русских решиться качать эту серию,мне лично с сохранением не понравилось,а так завтра думаю за раз весь день поиграю и пройду."
,Saibot67,2011-09-10T22:20Z,"Could someone pls let me know if its the ripped version, because if it is, then its not worth my time."
