AWESOME WORK.  AND YEEEHAW IT'S INTERNATIONAL CAPS LOCK DAY!!!!!!  YEEEHAAAW!
ANYWHOOO, ANY CHANCE OF YOU UPLOADING AMERICAN PIE 3?

cause that'd be sa-weet!!!!!!

And a skull is a good thing, means  you are trusted uploader, which is a designation you deserve in my opinion.  Good work."

Awesome work.  And you deserve a skull, I agree."
,dingledummy,2010-10-22T07:04Z,"stupid thing told me my comment failed so i reposted and now I have 3.......lame....I guess it would only be two if i didn't explain why I have 2 comments of similar meaning, but then you would be curious as to why there are two and it might make for unnecessary comments about my multiple comments.....how that for a mouthful.

That's why my name is DINGLEDUMMY!!!!!!!!!!! LOL"

I didn't care for any of the other American Pie movies so I wont be posting them. All this time I've been on TPB and haven't even noticed the skull stuff........and u say you're dumb.....LOL LOL LOL "

Yeah I gotta catch up with my Ipod rips for sure. I see u've been busy with yours. Pink is good by your name if you're a female...LOL LOL weird for a male tho. I would be cool with getting a skull but I guess u have to donate or something to get it. I'm sure i will get one sometime soon. Its good to hear from you. If I don't receive any new released Blu-rays this week, I'm gonna post all of my Ipod rips next weekend. "

Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 6 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc "
