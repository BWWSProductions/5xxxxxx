  This story is inspired from the life of     
  Paritala Ravi from South India who was      
  assassinated in January, 2005.              
                                              
  Paritala Ravi was arguably the most feared  
  individual ever in the history of the blood-
  ridden faction politics of South India.     
  He was a prime accused in innumerable murder
  cases and also survived numerous            
  assassination attempts, the most brutal of
