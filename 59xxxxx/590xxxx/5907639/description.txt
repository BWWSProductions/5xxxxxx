â€œ Lils Mackintosh is one of Holland's most popular jazz singers.  Her first album, â€œIt's Not Perfect To Be Easyâ€ was released in 1993 and had an enormous impact on the Dutch jazz scene.  Lils was labeled as â€œThe European Billie Holidayâ€ straight away.  The comparison is not a coincidence: the music as well as her life-story have a lot in common with Billie Holiday.  Deep sadness and great happiness have an obvious influence to her music.  Over the years Lils Mackintosh made several CD's and worked with famous artists like the Rosenberg Trio, Cor Bakker, Madeline Bell, Hans and Candy Dulfer, Louis van Dijk, The Beets Brothers and Georgie Fame.  The album â€œBlack Girlâ€ (produced by Hans Dulfer in 1999, (a tribute to the legendary American blues singer/guitarist Huddie Ledbetter), resulted in wide recognition as she received the important Dutch Edison Jazz Award in 2000.  In 2003 she formed the named â€œMackintosh Versus Kiers, Kooger & Krijgerâ€.  With this band Lils still sings the jazz songs she has performed for years with great succes.  But this band is different! The new personnel forms a different, inspiring musical base for Lils' vocals.  The expressive tenor sax sound of Wouter Kiers, the thriving groove of drummer Eric Kooger and the funky fat Hammond organ sound of Arno Krijger stimulate Lils to sing her heart out as she has never done before.  In 2004 she started the band â€œNobody's Bandâ€, a new jazz group around Lils.  With this band Lils plays a mix of well known and less well known jazz standards.  Besides concerts with her bands, Lils can be contracted for masterclasses (e. g.  at jazz festivals and music schools) and courses. â€ â€“ LilsMackintosh. nl
