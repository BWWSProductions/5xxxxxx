Product Description
This book covers in great detail virtually all known methods for making LSD. Emphasis is placed on using botanical sources of lysergic acid such as ergot and morning glory seeds, but extraction of ergotamine migraine pills is also covered. Every recipe is presented along with references back to the original works in the scientific liturature. The terminology used in the scientific works has been clarified and simplified, but each procedure is true to the original work. In addition, I also cover the production of the psychedelic TMA-2 from easily available and cheap calamus oil. Now that sassafras oil is difficult to obtain, this subject should be of great interest.
