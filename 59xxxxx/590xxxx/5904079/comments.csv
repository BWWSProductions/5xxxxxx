Included is an ISO file.
Just mount it using Daemon tools, or a similar program.
Or you can burn it to a CD and use it that way.

The CD must be in the drive, or the ISO must be mounted for access to the information."

Consumers should not have to decide between the cost-benefit of paying someone to repair against buying a new model. Efficiency, our planet and our progeny deserve better conservation methodologies."
