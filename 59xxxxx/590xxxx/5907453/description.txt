Rod Stewart - The great American songbook V - Fly me to the moon

1. That old black magic
2. Beyond the sea
3. I\'ve got you under my skin
4. What a difference a day makes
5. I get a kick out of you
6. I\'ve got the world on a string
7. My foolish heart
8. Love me or leave me
9. September in the rain
10. Fly me to the moon
11. On the sunny side of the street
12. Moon river
