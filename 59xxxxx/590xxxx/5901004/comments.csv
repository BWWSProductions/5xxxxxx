,KickassWashingMachine,2010-11-09T10:00Z,"As stated, this is a re-encode (i.e. twice encoded) of a 720p release from TiTANS.

You should avoid these re-encodes at all costs. Nothing wrong with going for a different size when ripping a Bluray disc, but this ain't a rip, it's a re-encode of a rip, and thus will fail on all quality parameters.

There are proper ones already here on the bay, fully seeded, so:
