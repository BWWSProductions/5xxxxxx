,hardstyledrifta,2010-10-29T10:08Z,"I think this is a re-up of a torrent from thebox.bz? Same info, same spelling mistake(McClaren!)...

I hope so, because i've just been banned from thebox(two accounts per household), and this is my only hope of getting to see the last two races(i'm in Australia).

Please please please tell me it's the same torrent?"
