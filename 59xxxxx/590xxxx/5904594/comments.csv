Enjoy 25mb/s of extra speed in the swarm.  Already at 10.574 ratio after only 20 minutes of seeding."
,CrystalWitch,2010-10-23T15:30Z,"Many thanks for this. See that the hit and runners still vastly outnumber those of us who seed. Selfish, selfish bastards. Hope their drives crash. :)"
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-24T07:21Z,"@crystalwitch,

It looks like the seeders outnumber the leechers, at least now.

Don't worry about the hit and runners.  I had a 2mb down, 500kb up connection for a while and could only seed so much.   Now that I have a symmetric 25mb/s connection, I seed like crazy.

Sometimes you can't pay it back right away.  Decent people will do what they can, when they can.

As for the selfish and ignorant folks, well, they are a fact of life and a source of friction for all of us.  They even seem to outnumber the decent folks.

Let them wallow in their misery.  Here in America, they formed a ""tea party"".  They deserve the shit that they wallow in."
,JohnChamp,2010-10-25T01:15Z,@PhilLesh12 Hit and runners are terrible and all but I think it's a serious stretch to connect them to the American Tea Party movement. They are more about reducing federal spending and keeping laws constructional than having lame up/dl ratios
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-26T02:47Z,"not really.  They want to reduce certain federal spending.  They are very selective about it.

They all still accept social security checks each month.

It's really about a black man being in the white house, that really got them all pissed off."
,JohnChamp,2010-10-28T02:42Z,"I think everybody is a selective when it comes to who should get govt spending and who shouldn't. And they should be, Obama and his camp doesn't really support NASA and as such cuts that federal spending. Supporters of nasa think this is a terrible idea. It all comes down to what political beliefs you have. Selective federal spending is always going to happen. 

Also, I partially agree with you. A lot of america is still quite racist and probably don't like that we have a black man as president. Personally I don't like that we have Obama as president not because he's black but because his political agenda so massively conflicts with mine and because I think he's in-experienced and polarizing. Long story short, I still think it's a stretch to label leechers as tea-party'ers and also a stretch to label all tea-party'ers as racists. Hell, blacks pull the racism card so often it's ridiculous, yet because they are a minority calling them out on it is ""racism."" How is that fair?"
