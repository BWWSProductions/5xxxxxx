         In Part One, "The Rise of the Dog," you'll learn about how    
         the domestication of dogs might have taken place, including   
         the theory of biologist Raymond Coppinger that it was the     
         animals themselves - and human trash - that inspired the      
         transformation. The genetic analysis of Peter Savolainen      
         of the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden has placed     
         the origins of domesticated dogs - and those of the first     
         dog - in East Asia. You'll also discover 14 dog breeds that   
         controversial genetic studies show are the most ancient -     
         and the best living representatives of the ancestors to       
          all living dogs.
