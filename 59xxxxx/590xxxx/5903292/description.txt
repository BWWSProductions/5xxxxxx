CIRCLE OF RAGE - PROBLEM, REACTION, SOLUTION.


Forget the restrictions of genre and embrace the creations of 5 dudes that crave passion, heart and soul in their music above all else. Finally, a band with something to say who have the balls to say it! Aggressive, politically motivated, metal/hardcore inspired music.

The NEED to ask questions and demand truth in times of deceit IS revolution.

Their intense live shows are a force to be reckoned with. If you get a chance to witness one - DO IT! You will be sure to find your head turning in their direction, with their â€˜in your faceâ€™ performances, unable to be ignored.
