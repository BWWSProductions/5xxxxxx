One of Hugh Grant's first major films has been without a torrent since I joined the game. I have searched for this for years, and finally found the DVD.

Lush costume drama set at Lake Geneva in 1816, when the eccentric poet Lord Byron (Hugh Grant) is visited by the poet Percy Shelley and his wife, the writer Mary Shelley, and challenges them all to write a horror story. Mary begins her later well-known novel, Frankenstein, and imagines that the monster becomes real. With Elizabeth Hurley in an unusual part as Byron's mistress (she actually became Grant's girlfriend in real life). Also with dr. John Polidori - Byron's secretary, friend and allegedly former lover. Polidori wrote a story called The Vampyre, the first story where a vampire is a suave aristocrat (modeled on Byron, no doubt).

Please note: This is an old Spanish-English production. There are slight disturbances in the soundtrack on the DVD, especially in the beginning, as if transferred from an old optical soundtrack. But it IS stereo.

Fantastic music. The main theme is this: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasia_on_a_Theme_by_Thomas_Tallis
On Spotify:
Andrew Davis & BBC Symphony Orchestra â€“ Vaughan Williams : Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis

The story has been interpreted and filmed several times:
