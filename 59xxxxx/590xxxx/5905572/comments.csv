Contrast/sharpness is cranked way too high, so it's an over-edgy eye-strain and heavy pixelation"
,Shungbat69,2011-01-03T07:59Z,Is Ben Stiller in this movie?
,beestripe,2011-01-23T12:32Z,"Yes, it's Ben Stiller's best fucking crap movie ever"
,beestripe,2011-01-23T12:43Z,"In fact it might just be the most best dreary fucking crap movie I've ever seen. 
It's longer the Titanic, even though it's not. The kind of movie you'd like to drop a big poo on..."
