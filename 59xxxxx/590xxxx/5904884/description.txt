NOTES! I use ELEKTRI4KA video wich i work a little bit on the source and change the brightness, contrast and colorsâ€¦
the audio source it`s from IMAGiNE release many thx for that, wich i work`it a little bit the sound & increase the volume.
I make the files much smaller without damaging the quality of the movie,and smaller files means faster downloading.
