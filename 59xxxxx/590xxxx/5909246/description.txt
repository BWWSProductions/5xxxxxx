 So you call yourself a connoisseur of music. Do you own Beneath My Wheels? Have you heard of Kevin Welch? That's alright, we forgive you. Come on in and pull up a chair.
Trying to describe Kevin Welch is like trying to describe flying, but here goes. Beneath My Wheels is a musical journey. Don't get on board the spaceship unless you want to leave planet Earth for awhile. Anna Lise Please is a love song for grown-ups. Fold Your Wings is deliciously seductive. I'm still not sure what a Hill Country Girl is, but I really want to be one. Bastard Nation takes the public debate of adoption to a personal, one on one level. And if you've ever been in love, you've been on the Shores of Stone.


So be good to yourself. Get Beneath My Wheels. It's cheaper than therapy and a lot more fun.
