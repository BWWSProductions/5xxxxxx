Thx!"
,prankella,2010-10-31T15:10Z,"Hi guys,
thanks so much for the uploaded file.
I am a new user of JeppView and I did each possible attempt to install it. As I read in many other post, the best solution should be to install the program disk and then an old version (911 or something) of the cycle. Only once registered with the old cycle, it was suggested to install this one (1021). I tried to do so, but even if I have a full registered software with the older cycle, after I finished to install the newest one the program requests me the site key again. And unfortunately, the one I previously insterted won't work anymore. I of course tried to install this new version immediately after I installed the program disk, but it did'n work.
Do you have any suggestion, please?
Thanks a lot in advance."
,warloot24k,2010-11-01T15:16Z,"prankella:

Uninstall again your jeppview 3.5 program disc.... then install it again but before you put the latest cycle..... install cycle 01-2009 so that you can still use the old key (R00D-KCAB).  If that works.... (sure it will work :)), you can install the latest cycle (1021)."
,a330bmi,2010-11-01T16:35Z,Hey does anyone have the codes? full world?

Guys, I've a problem. Does anyone know, how to update NavData in FliteDeck under Windows 7? Thanks for your support in advance! FliteStar works fine with current cycle, but FliteDeck strikes - Chart Data are autom. updated, but why not NavData?"
,MySony,2010-11-04T08:22Z,"Hi guys! Does anyone knows how to update data cycle on jeppesen mobile tc (iPad)? Of course, not on jeppesen server. Thanks."
,dnemethy,2010-11-04T09:46Z,"Hi! Any ideas about the Jeppview serial number?
It is asking about it and I don't know what to do. There is no crack file either. Plz hlp"
,dnemethy,2010-11-04T09:53Z,I forgot to state that the Jeppview serial number I need is for cycle 1021. Thanks
,dnemethy,2010-11-04T09:56Z,Serial number for cycle 1021??? Thx
,prankella,2010-11-04T12:04Z,"To warloot24k:
thanks for your help, but that's what I did so far actually! Anyway you are talking about a JeppViev 3.5, but on the splash screen of the program appears 3.7. I don't know if maybe it is a problem of the program version! Are you suggesting me to download the 3.5?"
,TheTraveller15,2010-11-04T12:29Z,"Thx so much for the link to cycle 1022, has anybody got the VFR Europe code, Worldwide is included but VFR Europe isn't!"

,warloot24k,2010-11-05T11:38Z,"to prankella:

Yes, download first the jeppview 3.5 and install it before installing the updates.  The updates I believe is responsible for the program upgraded to 3.7."
,TheTraveller15,2010-11-10T23:54Z,"Hi guys,

as time goes on, anybody out there with 1023?

THX!"
,prankella,2010-11-19T14:10Z,"To warloot24k:
thanks, I installed first the program disk and then exactly the cycle you mentioned (901) and it solved my issue. Thanks again!"
