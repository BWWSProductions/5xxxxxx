,ObscureClassics,2011-12-19T04:20Z,"DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS! 
this shit keeps skipping on vlc diring the rice-planting scene. what the fuck. can you re-upload this?"
,MixedUpZombie,2012-02-24T01:11Z,Don't listen to my previous comment (written by my previous account ObscureClassics). I used Media Player Classic with the klite video codec to play this and it works fine. This is the best torrent to one of the best movies ever made. It even comes with 2 different commentary tracks! Do yourself a favor and DOWNLOAD THIS. Seeding won't hurt either. 
,EXPERIMENTONGOD,2012-06-12T12:26Z,"Absolutely fantastic. I bought the DVD of this some time ago and it's utter shit, Criterion is where it's at. Of course I wasn't going to buy the movie twice so I'm watching this version.

Thanks for sharing -jonny-, your name is a true seal of quality"
