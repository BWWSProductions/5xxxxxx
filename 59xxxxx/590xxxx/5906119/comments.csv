cant you read the description? it does state that the language is in english if you actually look and read before posting stupid ass comments on peoples torrent sites..... ??? @_@ ???"
,DTiddy,2010-10-24T01:42Z,could someone rate the video and audio 
,kpz81,2010-10-24T02:54Z,"Audio is great....apparently I'm dumb and can't get any video. Can anyone explain how I can make my computer show it is a video? Media player opens, and plays the sound, it just doesn't show the video. Hope you can help! Thanks!"
,YouCanTrustMe,2010-10-24T03:06Z,"THANKS FOR YOUR TIME AND EFFORT PROVIDING GREAT TORRENTS AS ALWAYS! ..........
NOTE:The spanish version has a different ending than this english version. Better ending on the spanish version. "
,Maxxax,2010-10-24T03:50Z,"@kpz81.

Have you got VLC Media Player? it plays 99% of files. its great.

Will comment on A/V quality when downloaded, gonna takes 8-9hours on 45kb/s connection"
,JenKav09,2010-10-24T03:53Z,Thanks for the links buddy! :) does this have a password? cause i hate these ones with pw
,calkinsclan666,2010-10-24T04:47Z,this one is all good...english....a/6 V/6 good job man...thnx....
,shahidshahoo,2010-10-24T05:27Z,dvdrip is what i like ?
,zuul47,2010-10-24T08:06Z,"@kpz81

media player probably needs a video codec to play the actual video...if it has an error and asks you if you want web help choose that and it takes u to microsoft website ans it shows you the name of the codec u need...copy the name on google and find a free download site...thats it..enjoy:)"
,zuul47,2010-10-24T08:08Z,VLC is a great alternative as well
,Regulator5811,2010-10-24T09:05Z,Just made this account to let everyone know that this DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ENTIRE ENDING!!! THERE IS ABOUT 2 MINUTES OF CRUCIAL VIDEO LEFT OFF AFTER THE TEXT WHEN THE VIDEO CUTS OFF. 
,AoF,2010-10-24T09:58Z,"Audio = 6.5
Video = Blurry, cropped so I give it a 3"

[T],n2kmaster,2010-10-24T19:00Z,"K I was wonering why it ended so stupid. By far the first one was soooooo much better done, the dog and kid was a nice touch but the first one was definately better."
,Zylem,2010-10-24T21:18Z,"First one def better. For a cam i'd say A:8 V:6 M:5
Sometimes it seems a little quite, struggling to hear every lil thing. Seems cropped. Little dark in a few spots. slightly pixeled with a dudes head in a spot. (didn't effect movie and was gone soon) Camera moved i think once during movie and focus was pretty decent, one or two scenes took a second to focus. Ending does seem short (missing). no audio echo. Overall good cam from a experienced guy.  Thx for the upload. dont pay to see it in theatres. "

movie is unwatchable in parts, the audio and video are quite bad, and it seems like a large part of the end of the movie is missing, i would recommend waiting for a better copy........"

,BiGdRe323,2011-01-02T23:43Z,@pwoatii: try watching your file with vlc media player it has to work with that media player.
