,Kellso76,2010-10-23T23:03Z,Its good to hear from you PT. I appreciate everything u taught me. You're the best!. I have a couple of people asking me about Encode-Handheld so I helped as much as I could and referred them to you or HR. What have you been up to? I see you have taken a hiatus from Demonoid. I also have had questions on where to get the latest build of Encode-Handheld. I have the program on three Macs now so it is taking less time to rip then before.
