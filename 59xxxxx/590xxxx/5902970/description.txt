Sheena Easton - 9 to 5 (Morning Train) [promo].VOB 



Very HQ rare promo music video. "9 to 5" is the title of a popular song 
recorded by Sheena Easton in 1980, becoming her biggest hit. It peaked at 
number three in the United Kingdom in August 1980 and was released in the 
United States in February 1981 (retitled Morning Train to avoid confusion 
with Dolly Partonâ€™s â€œ9 to 5â€), where it reached number one. The song is 
about a woman who waits at home all day for her man to come home from work. 
This music video was filmed on the Bluebell Railway, a heritage line running 
between East and West Sussex in England. The video stars London and South 
Western Railway No. 488, a preserved LSWR 0415 Class locomotive.
