  wow!   This is the weirdest. 
The Music is in great quality - the singing I didn't expect, The english used is horrible. 

  I am so glad I got to preview this instead of having to buy it and find out how incredibly aweful it is. 

   If you have not heard this and you need a laugh or two, check it out, It really is so bad it's funny. Seriously, I was laughing my head off. 

  Thanks for everything.  "
