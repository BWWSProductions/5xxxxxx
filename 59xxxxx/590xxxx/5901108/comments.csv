,sunny2008,2010-10-22T06:55Z,"Hi Sailo1, Thankyou always for the lovely Bluray to DVDR rips. Was waiting for the Toy Story Br-DVDr. Appreciate your efforts. A request and suggestion. A large no. of us DL this type of BRay to DVDR convert, as we find the quality way better than the normal DVDRs. It will be great if we can have more of video quality and avoid the other language audios, like in this one. As you know well, even if these audio addons take just a few 100 mbs, they do eat into the video quality. Can we request you to give regular DD5.1 English and the subs(that you always provide in any case). Will be awesome if this is possible. Thanks a ton in advance!! "

,XP1,2011-01-08T23:43Z,"My observations:

1) Most of the written text and the signs are in Chinese in the video.
2) Around 20 min, the English audio is out of sync for several seconds.

,arthaxerxes,2011-01-22T23:30Z,"Can someone comment on what XP1 said (about Chinese text and sign throughout the movie? Does that ruin the movie for someone who does not read Chinese?

Thanks for the upload and any feedback!"
,MoviesR101,2011-07-14T21:07Z,"Thanks Sailo! The quality is good as always but XP1 is partially right, at the very beginning when it 1st comes on Toy Story 3 is in Chinese? If you don't mind Chinese text, than this is for you! I personally can not read Chinese?"
