Here is an awesome collection of ghouly tunes from the 50Â´s and 60Â´s. Various styles - Las Vegas grinders, surf, rockabilly, rocknroll and some oddballs. See the backcover for what you get.

Note: when you burn this ( in Nero ) be sure to have the box " Normalize all audio files " checked. You will get an more even level of the tunes that way.

And if you like this one, please write something in the comments.
