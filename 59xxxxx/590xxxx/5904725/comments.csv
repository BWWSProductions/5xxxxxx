You commented on a fake upload by a new uploader for this very same torrent 3 days ago.  You even told me to fuck off.

But, it turns out, the mods deleted that upload, because they discovered that it was a fake, like I figured out when I saw the spam links to other torrents in the torrent file.

Everyone else:  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5902523/An.Idiot.Abroad.S01E05.HDTV.720p.x264-DaveUK  This is a larger file, but it is true, I've watched the show, and it is from a trusted member.

mc_homes is one of the shills or other fake uploaders.

Seriously, mc_homes...  

http://thepiratebay.org/search/an%20idiot%20abroad/0/99/0

Where is that ""real"" torrent now?  You can't find it.  It was deleted by the mods because it was fake and it had spam links in the torrent (spam links, not links to spam.  If you are not new to the interwebz, you might know the difference.)"
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-23T07:54Z,"I'll explain the difference between spam links and links to spam, for you.

links to spam are links that take you to sites that are basically spam.

spam links are excessive links of unwanted material within another file.  i.e., if I download a torrent, and in addition to the avi file and maybe an .nfo, .svt, maybe a readme.txt or whatever, there are a dozen .torrent files to other torrents, those torrent links are, for all intents and purposes, SPAM.

Get it?

dude i just dont like you.  you spam every idiot abroad up with post after post of useless babel.  each of ur posts is like freakin 30 lines long.  so just shut the fuck up.  if people think this upload of mine if fake then dont download it.  if i could prevent phillesh from downloading it i would. phillesh sucks and so does the rest of the grateful dead.


but if you did download this and are happy please leave a nice comment

thanks! :)"
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-23T07:59Z,"For everyone else,

I will seed the cenkota 1.21 gb version with my brand new 25/25 fiber optic FiOS connection for the next day and a half to ensure that it is speedy and quick.  The link is two comments above this one.

No limit to upload speed, and I've put in 260000 minutes of seeding.

25mb upload added to cenkota's swarm.

Or you can download this garbage from a guy that has only uploaded this single file."
,mc_homes,2010-10-23T07:59Z,"i dont know why that torrent was deleted, but the reason my torrent i put up of this last night was deleted is because i deleted it myself.  The copy had sync issues, so i deleted it until a resynced copy was made...hence why there has been no xvid copy of this up until now."
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-23T08:02Z,"@mc_homes,

You obviously haven't read any of my shitty comments.

WHERE IS THE EP05 TORRENT THAT YOU DIDN'T LIKE MY COMMENT TO?

IT HAS BEEN DELETED BECAUSE IT WAS FAKE!!!

Get over yourself.

I've been a member here for 4 1/2 years.  I know when I see fakes.  You telling me to fuck off because I try to warn other people?  That's just newbie bullshit."
,xanthyos,2010-10-23T08:23Z,it's not fake. appreciate the upload. phillesh has no class.
,mc_homes,2010-10-23T08:30Z,"stop spamming my torrent with your useless comments.  this is a legit torrent.  why dont you go sit in a corner and listen to the grateful dead, you daft yuppie.  stay out of the comment section!!!"
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-23T08:38Z,"@mc_homes,

If you go back and read the comments in ferrelas first and second up of this show, you'll understand that I call them like I see them, and when I realize I am wrong, I admit it.

At first I expressed suspicion.  Then I acknowledged that he was the real deal.  Then I was a bit perturbed by the loss of seeders, and when he explained that he had to turn his computer off overnight, I apologized and reported back that I seeded for a while after I finally completed my download.

You really need to actually read the comments, not just see how many lines exist and assume you can't comprehend them so therefore you are going to assume the smart people are attacking you again.

Pay special attention to his second upload, of the second episode.  

I wrote a comment that he should be given trusted status, and two or three comments later, a mod gave him trusted status.

If you notice, ferrelas has a skull next to his name now.

I'm just sayin'.  I know what looks suspicious.  I can be more direct when it is absolute, by posting a comment like ""FAKE!"", and when I'm only a little suspicious, I express my suspicions by saying ""hey, this looks a little suspect"".

If you had actually read any of my comments, and wasn't a clone of Karl, you'd figure that out on your own.

The fact that I have to explain that to you tells me I have to probably trust that you are upping legit stuff but just don't think too quickly.

Time will tell."
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-23T08:45Z,"@xanthyos,

You're absolutely right.  I definitely have no class.

But you need to actually read the comments in this thread and the threads of both of Ferrelas' ups.

I'm not a dick (well, yes, I really am), I'm just aware of all of the signs of bad torrents.

When I'm wrong, I'll admit it.  Ferrelas got a skull because I admitted that I misjudged him.  

Ferrelas even acknowledged why he was initially viewed suspiciously.  Everyone figured out he was a good dude, and all were happy.

mc_homes just got angry because an American uses better english than he does.  Sour grapes, and angry tirades."
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-23T08:50Z,"Holy shit, mc_homes, are you admitting that you created a new account after your torrent was deleted and your account banned?


I don't even know how to report you to the mods, and I wouldn't, anyway, but seriously, that was bad form, dude.  You practically exposed yourself to being banned again.

better find a new proxy."
,mc_homes,2010-10-23T09:34Z,"phil, if you are going to blast me for not reading your ridiculous mess of comments i would appreciate you step up and fully read mine.

i said i don't know why the torrent in question was deleted.  (the one where i called you an idiot in the comments.)  I had nothing to do with that torrent, i just noticed you said he was spamming when he wasn't so i called you out on it.

the Reason ""MY"" torrent was deleted was because i deleted it Myself.  I realized it was badly synced.  

My torrent i deleted has nothing to do with the torrent you are blabbing about. 

So shut the fuck up and go away.  you are so freaking annoying.  jeezus..."
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-23T09:37Z,"That sucks for you, mc_homes.

You attack a long time user. 

You watched and learned that Ferrelas got a trusted skull.

So you obviously thought you could do the same and maybe get a trusted skull.

But you are a shill.

You are hoping that you can become legit the same way Ferrelas did.

Aren't you just working for a copyright holder?

Or are you just dull?"

-----------

I've read every word of your comments.

YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE NOT.

Either you are an idiot, or I'm just not stating my case properly.

I APOLOGIZE IF I FAILED TO MAKE MY CASE CLEARLY.

Seriously, go back and comprehend all of my comments.

It's not that hard.  I wrote my comments in english.

You shot off the handle.  I was being diplomatic (until now), and only questioning uploaders' validity.  You told me to go fuck myself.

Sorry dude, you might have had the best intentions, but I'm pretty sure nobody is going to trust your torrents.

Let's not forget, you probably wanted to benefit from Ferrelas' early wariness that resulted in a trusted skull.

Aren't you just trying to mimick that?  He was doubted, He followed through, he produced a valid file, and he became trusted.

You bitched at ME, you told me to fuck off, on a torrent that got deleted.  

That is why you look completely suspicious.  

Really suspicious.  You are trying way too hard."
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-23T10:01Z,"You are either not reading my comments or you just can't admit when you are wrong.

Either way, you fail."
,mc_homes,2010-10-23T10:12Z,"dude i am just giving karl to the people.  i noticed no xvid was up of ep 5 so i went and got one, and then i upped it.  i asked nicely if you would stay out of my comments and you wouldnt..i guess that egged you on a bit..but come on man.  anyway, i dont care if i get a skull or not.  it doesnt matter to me..  i just wanted to up it and either be thanked or whatever, not constant bashing by you."
,oithatguyoi,2010-10-23T10:46Z,thanks for the up man.. been waiting for one i can stream on my xbox!!! great quality 
,foxhound1,2010-10-23T11:39Z,Thanks for the upload Mc.  Couldn't find the show in normal size and didn't want to download the 1.2gb version.
,PhilLesh12,2010-10-23T11:52Z,"@mc_homes,

Maybe you are legit, but if you didn't want to be bashed by a regular on TPB, you shouldn't have told him to fuck off for questioning a new uploader with no history.

Especially since you decided to become an uploader with no history a few days later.

I only hunt down the fakers and copyright enforcers.  But, others just do not like people who join and start talking smack.

You talked smack to me.  So I pounced on your first up.

There are others on here who will tell  you that what you did was absolute bullshit.  Come on here, as a newbie, and start to tell people what comments they can or cannot make.

Pretentious bullshit offends people.

Telling people to go fuck themselves or whatever, well, that shit doesn't fly."
,mc_homes,2010-10-23T15:48Z,"idk how you can call yourself a ""regular"" you dumbfuck.  ive been on piratebay for a few years too, probably just as long as you.  and i see you have no uploaded torrents either, so i see that as i have 1 up on you.  so leave me the fuck alone.  I didnt post this to get a skull or be trusted, and sure that would be awesome to get but i sure as hell wouldn't want to get a skull from your behalf.  I dont plan on uploading a lot of stuff, i just wanted to put this episode outthere in the xvid format.  

if no one uploads ep 6 on here within the first few hours and i decide to download it and upload it here can you please stay out of the comment section?  you are like a disease phil, the kind that bugspray doesn't even kill :p"

,mr_happy_boy,2010-10-23T22:36Z,"good job mc_homes, for some reason these torrents take a while to filter through and seeing as I watch these on the laptop I'm not interested in a high res version.  As for PhilLesh, I'm assuming the 12 refers to your age?  Cunt."

,twelveightyone,2010-10-25T19:35Z,"I've downloaded all 5 episodes from you so far, and each one has been great so thank you. Been in Amsterdam this weekend so when I got back I downloaded it (I just looked for the word 'hannibal' in the title) and it's perfect.

And as for PhilLesh12... dude, seriously, put the keyboard down, lay off the coffee, have a splif and calm the fuck down. It's a real shame you can't regulate who can comment on your files, but I guess you have to put up with complete tossers sometimes. If anything, his myopic rants show how much of a twat he is."
,rasta114,2010-10-25T23:36Z,"Hey fantastic upload.. Keep up the good work..
It's my first download from here, I usually use another site.... But after reading PhilLesh12's comments I had to register so I can tell him how much of a F@*king knob he is.. PhilLesh12 in future if some one asks you to stay out of the comment box then just do that you F@*king dick."
,fbedna,2010-10-26T13:35Z,"I have no idea what's the quarrek about, but the video itself is alright. It is the AIA S01E05. Lower quality, which is OK for my slower PC..."
