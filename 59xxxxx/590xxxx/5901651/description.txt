Biography by Jo-Ann Greene allmusic.com

Singer, musician, composer, and rebel Peter Tosh cut a swathe through 
the Jamaican musical scene, both as a founding member of the Wailers 
and as a solo artist. He toured with the Rolling Stones and had an 
international hit with a duet with Mick Jagger, then toured again to 
equally rapturous world audiences as the headlining act. His words 
would cause an uproar at the One Peace concert, but then unlike 
fellow Wailer Bob Marley, Tosh always made his true feelings known. 
He was born Winston Hubert McIntosh on October 19, 1944, in the small 
rural village of Grange Hill, Jamaica. Like so many young island 
teens searching for a better life, he left home at 15 and headed for 
Kingston. Once there, he made his way to Joe Higgs' tenement yard, 
joining other aspiring youths eager for the vocal coaching lessons 
the singing star provided to local teens. Amongst these youthful 
wannabes were Bunny, Bob Marley, and the much younger Junior 
Braithwaite; the four, buttressed by backing vocalists Cherry Green 
and Beverley Kelso, joined forces initially as the Teenagers before 
eventually settling on the moniker the Wailers.
