,mikepad123,2010-10-25T18:56Z,I dont understand how to set this game up after downloading it......I'm very new to this!  Please help!

It's quite simple actually.

1. Use DAEMON tools:
Link: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3997540/DAEMON_Tools_Lite_4.11.2_-_TheOneX
2. Mount the image (add)
3. Follow the installation instructions
4. If the game doesn't work (find the game in program files) then use the crack. Found in the disk (right click on storage where disk is) and copy the crack and replace it with the original application.

,Lophkers,2010-10-31T07:33Z,"Oddly it said that the image was damaged. so I couldn't mount it.
I used DAEMON Tools. Can anyone help! =("
,kptkooker,2010-12-02T08:09Z,"game does not work.get the error message ""unable to mount image. file not accessible"" when trying to mount on daemon tools. can anybody help?"
,LadyAshura,2010-12-02T22:29Z,"Fixed Problem. 

Rename the bin file to pm-alcty

However, the CD is now saying it is ALCATRAZ TYCOON.  This is a different game. However, I will install and find out for sure. "
,LadyAshura,2010-12-02T22:35Z,"This is confirmed. This game is NOT Prison Tycoon Alcatraz.

This game is ALCATRAZ TYCOON.  It is all the same concept but not from the ""Prison Tycoon"" series. This is a knock-off. 

I haven't played it yet. I will do that later. Heck, I may even buy the game and up the real one here....since I can't seem to find it anywhere. "
,Bread15,2010-12-16T21:59Z,"can confirm it IS NOT Prison Tycoon Alcatraz. Daemon tools wouldnt work either, so had to fix and burn with ImgBurn"
,spotjuh,2011-04-24T04:43Z,"how the fuck would you ever mount a bin file dumb shit and its even not prison tycoon alcatraz if you wanna be ""populair"" don't do it like this ;)"
,Wolfcry,2011-05-13T13:35Z,spotjuh @ Did you just define retarded?.
,Lophkers,2011-06-04T20:41Z,"How to install:
This is pretty much like LadyAshura's fix. Mines just a bit more simpler.

1. Rename .bin file to: pm-alcty

2. Rename .cue (Disk) file to: Alcatraz Tycoon

3. Then mount with a disk mounter (DAEMON Tools)."
,afasuger,2011-07-04T15:08Z,This is the best prison game.
