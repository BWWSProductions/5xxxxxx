,goukifafa,2010-10-26T10:55Z,"dont download this, i spnt ages getting the info on getting this to my hard drive, but after using the best file splitter comgenie's file splitter and merging onto the hard drive, the game boots up the sega logo then does not load."
,raypirate,2010-10-28T11:30Z,"gouk- your missing something out as it works 100% played it the other day. make sure you put in on the internal my config is 

xplain>hermes v3>gaia bm>open managet tools v1 to split 

when you port to internal drive gaia will auto merge files hey presto woks.

Only issue im having now is getting games to play without the aid of a disk in the drive,, some work without disk using copy opton in gaia but you need native disk. think that its to do with hex and eboot will be reading up on this more over next days :) PB rocks thanks consolas "
