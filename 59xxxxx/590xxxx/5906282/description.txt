To celebrate the 70th anniversary of the King of Soccer.

Thanks to fredalme @KG for provide the rip and for vandercolombo for english subs.

Edson Arantes do Nascimento, or just PelÃ©, was the best soccer (football) player the world has ever known. He's also considered, by many people, the athlete of the century. He's considered to be the most famous person in the world. Everybody who saw him playing say he was some kind of genius of the sport. He could invent plays as no other player ever could. In this documentary, through the eyes of various players and friends, people who couldn't actually see PelÃ© during his years as a professional player (1957 - 1974), have a chance to see what they have missed. PelÃ© is still a famous person in Brazil, where he lives (he's 64 years old now). We still see him on TV very often, and his talent survives time thanks to lots of images saved in documentaries like this one.
