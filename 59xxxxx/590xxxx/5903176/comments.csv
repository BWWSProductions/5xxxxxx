,manciuxl1,2010-10-22T11:56Z,"this real?
kinda looks FAKE"
[H],HeroMaster,2010-10-22T12:09Z,"@manciuxl1, its real dude, it is a scene release."
,manciuxl1,2010-10-22T13:35Z,"Hero_No_1 good
ever since o got a badass virus form starcraft 2 crack im a little more careful with this stuff"
[H],HeroMaster,2010-10-22T14:00Z,"@manciuxl1 its nothing dude, works great, skidrow never gives a virus or a trojon, it would be the problem of anti-virus, just disable it and then try, see it will work like a charm."
,SWEfriggeMS92,2010-10-22T14:51Z,"Is this complimentary to this update:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5901181/Fallout.New.Vegas.Update.1-SKIDROW
Or have I got it wrong? Cause I used the one above only and the game had problems with quests, gonna try using this on top of the other one now and see if it works better. Really glad I didn't waste any money one buying this game before it works."
,FelatioSucks,2010-10-22T15:44Z,"there's a second update out now anyway so this torrent is redundant:
