To me it looks like we may have to pack these files into an ISO. 

I don't really know how to do that though. When I find out, I post on here."
,joedesu1,2010-10-25T00:11Z,What in the hell do i do with all of these files?
,vietnoboy,2010-10-25T01:59Z,"I have figured it out.

Download UMDgen. Just google it.

Extract the file. Open up UMDgen.

Click and drag PSP_GAME and UMD_DATA.BIN into the big white blank window. Then click save, uncompressed iso.

Your ISO file is now complete. 

Disable any plug ins for the game to work. I had to."
,GamesoulMaster,2010-10-27T09:13Z,"Actually, that solution isn't going to work for most people. I already tried that route when I first downloaded it, but it wouldn't let me overwrite the ""default"" file and folder the program puts there, and there's no way to remove those items from the list.

Although maybe there's some alternate ""UMDGen"" program (I use the official Sony one), or maybe an alternate version that isn't quite as rough (which, unfortunately, is how programs not made for public use tend to be). Either way, I don't understand why this game was uploaded as files from the disc instead of a disc image."
,vietnoboy,2010-10-27T12:57Z,"You  don't want to overwrite anything. Just place the files in the program, then save it as an iso in a new location, such as your desktop. 

This will create an ISO file which can be accessed my your CFW. 

But this game kinda sucks anyway. It uses the engine by Aedis Eclipse, another PSP game. But the transition from army strategy to RPG strategy is really badly done. This makes the game not even worth playing with the likes of Final Fantasy Tactics, Disgaea and etc out there. "
,klako,2010-10-28T16:23Z,Thanks for the game and instruction. It works. I am using UMDGen_v4.00. When googling seems to have several version out there.
