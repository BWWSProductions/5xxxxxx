[V],-jonny-,2010-10-24T13:10Z,"Cheers. But the colour of the skull doesn't matter. A green skull isn't better than a pink one. Either way, people are reassured the downloads are legit."

,orange7,2011-09-01T08:53Z,"@UAofe don't bite the hand that feeds. What are you 12? you criticize people for their choice in colour? assuming you have a choice between pink and green. Brow some balls and and as you're at it some brains. 

Thanks uploader!"
