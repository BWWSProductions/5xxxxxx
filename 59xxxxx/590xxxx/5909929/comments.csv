,Revisionist,2011-05-09T19:28Z,"I am giving all of the series BOZX uploaded a 10/10.  Really excellent encoding.  I am always wary of ""highres"" downloads because a good many of them just arent worth the extra time/disc space.  Its usually the audio that bugs me the most but these were all great and actually sounded like surround sound should!
