Other torrent-programs offer very similar step."

However, all these are from my private collection, all movies are great - and some are impossible to get, as Masquerade, for example"
,hazel13,2010-10-24T22:57Z,Great uploads... Thank you 20/40!=>
,gdt653,2010-10-26T02:43Z,"Great stuff! Many thanks to TWENTYFORTY!

I'm seeding at maximum.... 24/7 while I download other torrents.

Guys.... your thanks are much appreciated, but pls seed & keep this torrent alive. I'm sadden that there are many seeders in the 1st 2 days but the # of seeders decreases sharply after that.

More seeders means Sir TWENTYFORTY will have more bandwidths to up more goodies!

More power!"
