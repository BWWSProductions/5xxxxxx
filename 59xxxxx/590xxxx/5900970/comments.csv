Phil_Sapphire: Thanks for the upload, but when you say this is better than episode 5, do you mean content or quality? Because both video and audio quality are surprisingly poor, considering the file size. This is a show that deserves a good quality torrent - at least 700Mb - or even 720p. "
,Phil_Sapphire,2010-10-28T22:18Z,"Unfortunately, I do not have the equipment as yet to ensure best quality. I try to only upload programs that are not already being uploaded from somewhere else (at I assume better quality). That way, at least people get some chance to see them (even at lower quality)."
,shakes_68,2010-11-28T08:05Z,"This isn't very good quality. There are other better torrents right here on piratebay, of the same episode"
