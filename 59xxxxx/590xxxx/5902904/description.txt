This is an amazing film and one of my very favorites! I recently purchased the DVD which was released in 2002. Itâ€™s a classic film with an outstanding cast and is impressively, musically scored as well! Rudolph Martin is amazing as Vlad Dracula. The movie depicts several, true historic happens such as:
-A young Vlad Dracula and his brother; Radu the Handsome, being held captive for years by the Turkish Sultan 
-Vlad Dracula choosing common people as his allies instead of members of high society
-Dracula, inviting members of the Romanian Noble Class to a State dinner then having them executed.
-The story of the â€œGolden Cupâ€
-Nailing the turbans to the heads of the Turkish Muslims for their refusal to remove them in Draculaâ€™s presence
-Vladâ€™s brother Radu choosing to live with and adopt the Muslim culture 
-Vlad Draculaâ€™s guerrilla warfare and military scare tactics
-Vladâ€™s disregard for the church in order to better his army and stabilize his country
-Vlad Dracula feasting among the bodies of the nobles he had killed

The movie also demystifies the folklore surrounding Vlad III, while still giving the viewer the choice to make up their own minds about the true person that he was.
Three years ago I spent the better part of a year researching Vlad III, Voivode of Wallachia, as he was an amazing historical figure far beyond merely being inspiration for vampire pop culture. And from all I have read, I always thought that this film truly displayed Vlad III/ Vlad Tepes/Vlad Dracula most accurately. I was happy to read a note of this from Wikipedia:
â€œDark Prince: The True Story of Dracula, a film released in 2000, tells the life story of Vlad the Impaler mostly accurately.â€

A classic picture to enjoy for Halloween! Please SEED! Cheers.
