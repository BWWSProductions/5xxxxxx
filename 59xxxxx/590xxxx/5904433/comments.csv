,bezzlebub666,2010-10-23T10:32Z,wheres the usa version
,Fan1,2010-10-23T11:32Z,Ingles = English no :) ? Is this real?
,DarkJoshua,2010-10-24T14:46Z,"hur fĂĽr man det att fungera med de redan installerade DLC:s ? , skivan startade bara originalet och hittade inte de 3 tidigare DLC:s...."
,Averros,2010-10-25T18:36Z,Strange but I cannot seem to complete this download.... stuck at 99.9% will not download past 7.23GB.
,madmmike,2010-10-25T21:07Z,I see that the original version is 6.34gb but the GOTY edition is 7.3gb. I know the DLC are on tokens so what exactly is the extra gb?
,frankzapp,2010-10-26T20:49Z,"I can't seem to find the add packs, I only get the original game. Somebody know how to?"
,frankzapp,2010-10-26T20:52Z,No puedo encontrar los expansiones. Solo me sale como el Borderlands normal. Como lo hago? 
,acr250rider,2010-10-27T06:22Z,Can`t tell if this is old one or GOTY ed? Time stamp is older on abgx! 
,zingo 1,2010-10-30T22:55Z,"There seems to be no add-on pack on this one.The time stamp on abgx is from 2009,so it can`t be the goty edition.Somebody knows where to find the real one?"
,nubin,2010-10-31T01:20Z,"Este cabronazo nos la ha metido doblada

Es el Borderlands normal !!!

Is the normal Borderlands !!!"
,Sa^][^aN,2010-11-01T21:41Z,"FAKE !  No DLC , its The original version of Borderland. "
,jaque311,2010-11-02T15:43Z,"does anyone know, is it coming or not?
haven't found it anywhere"
,unique223,2010-11-07T03:37Z,"The GOTY edition is just the regular, updated game packaged with codes to download the DLC packs.

This IS legit, just useless."
,MasBass,2010-11-10T12:02Z,"This is working fine BUT all DLC come as coupons inside the game box and must be downloaded separately via XBox Live, so they are not embedded in this download.

Something you should also know, if you want to play the first 2 DLC (Ned & Moxxi) installed from that bundle disc ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5488315/Borderlands.Addon.Pack.XBOX360-MARVEL%28Unpacked%29 ) they will NOT work with this version of Borderlands. This version only accepts non-bundled dlc content."
,rialin,2011-02-06T11:38Z,"According to the info all the addons are supposed to be included in this GOTY version, therefore the packs for the non-GOTY version donÂ´t work with this.

Can anyone confirm that the GOTY includes the addons?"
,monstaninja,2011-05-02T03:44Z,it would be nice if more people seeded then i would confirm
