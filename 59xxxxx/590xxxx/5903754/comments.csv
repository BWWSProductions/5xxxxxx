,Gerr,2010-10-23T00:28Z,"Thanks. Quality is indeed a little better than brint's source, 16:9 looks good. Hope this will be a regular thing.

Appreciate both of you capping though. It's always good to have options, especially if one of you happens to miss an episode."
,user2598,2010-10-23T02:03Z,"Great quality. Fantastic to see The Amazing Race taken from an HD source. Hope you cap the rest of the season, thanks!"
,LCP-1,2010-10-23T03:01Z,"Thanks for the comments, will try to cap as many episodes as possible. Although the broadcast is HD, it is unfortunate that the capture hardware is still analogue SD. Will work on improving the quality a little more."
