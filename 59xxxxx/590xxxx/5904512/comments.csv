,idayv,2010-10-23T12:16Z,Forget what I said... it's working (sorry for the negative vote)
,jberry872,2010-10-24T04:21Z,"both DMG's are solid. The installer on the Combo Update gives me an error and tells me to contact the Manufacture, the Delta Update works. I've noticed no difference for the good. The log in screen loads slower on boot up, applications are about a second or two longer loading. I used the included reversioner to go back to 10.6.4.... Ill wait till Apple releases it"
,mariuspmg,2010-10-24T15:09Z,the applications are faster after the cache in!
,mariuspmg,2010-10-30T10:39Z,"and the battery lasts longer, way longer, with even more tasks"
,mrsj93,2010-10-31T20:15Z,"Any visual enhancements (mission control, ipad like applications view..)?"
,ptjh,2010-12-11T21:48Z,"Does having this update here mean that you can only use the normal 'software update' option with a legitimate version of osx? Do have to DL updates from here if you use the retail 6.3 dvd on piratebay?
Cheers"
