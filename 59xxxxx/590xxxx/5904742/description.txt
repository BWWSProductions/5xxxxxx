The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 (Russian: ÐœÐ¸ÐºÐ¾ÑÐ½ Ð¸ Ð“ÑƒÑ€ÐµÐ²Ð¸Ñ‡ ÐœÐ¸Ð“-21; NATO reporting name "Fishbed") is a supersonic jet fighter aircraft, designed by the Mikoyan-Gurevich Design Bureau in the Soviet Union. 

It was popularly nicknamed "balalaika", from the aircraft's planform-view resemblance to the Russian stringed musical instrument or oÅ‚Ã³wek (English: pencil) by Polish pilots due to the shape of its fuselage. 


Early versions are considered second-generation jet fighters, while later versions are considered to be third-generation jet fighters. Some 50 countries over four continents have flown the MiG-21, and it still serves many nations a half-century after its maiden flight. The fighter made aviation records. At least by name, it is the most-produced supersonic jet aircraft in aviation history and the most-produced combat aircraft since the Korean War, and it had the longest production run of a combat aircraft (1959 to 1985 over all variants).
