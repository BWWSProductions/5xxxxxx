,ipoddude1,2010-11-21T12:32Z,"Great torrent.

I just wonder, what settings in handbrake do you use when converting the video files? I've tried a couple of times to convert a video for my ipod touch (using about the same framerate, codec etc.), but for some reason I can't add the video to the device (""Can't be played on this ipod"").

Would appreciate your reply."
,HolyAssassins,2010-12-01T19:51Z,Great show. Awesome upload. Could you continue uploading the episodes throughout this season?

,bob.lb,2011-03-07T04:32Z,"@ipoddude1: Sometimes you need to copy it to the library before putting it on your iPod. That's what I've done and it's worked every time so far.

@on.off.on: Another great torrent, thanks very much. Is it possible you could update this to include the next few episodes of Season 4?"
