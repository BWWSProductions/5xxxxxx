BUDDY GUY LIVING PROOF
Label: Jive
Released:26th October 2010
Format:Flac



Buddy Guy eases into his latest release with a swampy, acoustic-guitar-driven blues, reflecting on life from the perspective of a man who, at "74 Years Young," can boast, "I've been all around the world/Everywhere is home/Drank wine with kings and the Rolling Stones/I've got a few scars from the battles I won 'cause I'm 74 years young."
And that's when the guitar explodes, mixed high enough to grab you with the first bent note of a solo that effortlessly lives up to that young part of that title as it plays connect-the-dots from Guy's own distant past through Jimmy Page's most exhilarating freak-outs to the White Stripes' most inspired stabs at rising to this level. A head-spinning flurry of notes that only lets up long enough to squeeze some more emotion from another bend or two, it's the scrappiest, flashiest statement of purpose a person could hope for in an artist half his age
