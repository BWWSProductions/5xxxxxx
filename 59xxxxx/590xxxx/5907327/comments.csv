,Canowyrms,2010-11-10T11:29Z,"dm1970 - there were reported issues running this game. try searching the wiihacks forums for answers, they're excellent for resources. I'm using Configurable USB loader and have not had any problems. As for your PAL-only game issue, check your settings, and ass wiiman1982 said, try region free. or even try a different mod. I'm hoping this works with no work-arounds..."
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-02-18T01:00Z,"There is false information floating around that a Wii softmod will play any region game, regardless of the origin of the hardware. This is not true.. a NTSC Wii will play some PAL games with a softmod, but definitely not all. Some will simply not work with any software (but trying different loaders may get it to work). However, playing a disc image from your own region should work every time (assuming you are playing from a USB drive and not a burned disc). I have no experience with a PAL softmodded Wii playing NTSC-U games, so I cannot speak for that. "
,MrSan.,2012-06-05T19:59Z,"I have downloaded this game from the following torrent file and the disc did not worked on my 4.0U Wii, so I suppose that the files of this torrent will not work too:
