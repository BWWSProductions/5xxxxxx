"Let Me Entertain You"

Susan's days as a sexy internet sensation may be 
coming to an end after she angers an important 
client and incurs the wrath of her boss, Maxine; 
Renee and Gabrielle are headed for a smackdown after 
each of them reveals an intimate secret about the 
other to the wrong people; Bree finds herself 
exhausted by younger lover Keith's sexual stamina; 
Lynette is angry with Tom after he asks his mother 
to become the baby's nanny without talking it over 
with her first; and housewife Emma Graham (singer-
songwriter Dana Glover) puts on a cabaret show -- 
with the aid of saxophonist Dave Koz -- with 
surprising results.

Enjoy :)
