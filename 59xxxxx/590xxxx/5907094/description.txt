50 Outdoor Skills - Everyone Needs to Know to Survive



Whether you're a veteran camper or an occasional hiker, you'll find information to enhance your outdoor adventures in this

program from expert guide and environmentalist Dick Person.

Along with his assistant, Laura Zealand, Person provides advice for every possible eventuality: from basic skills such as how to

build a "one match" fire to information on proper gear, staying safe and dealing with emergencies.


# SKILLS - like the 'one match' fire, knots, knife and axe use

# EMERGENCIES - what if you're lost? Hypothermia? Signaling? Medicinal plants?

# STUFF TO WEAR - for wet and dry. The miracle scarf. Natural bug repellants and sun blocks.

# GREAT FOOD - like 'beautiful Bannock', grub for pack and canoe, cook kits & stoves.

# SAFE & COMFY - from bears! The canoe shelter, Whelen tent & safe water
.
# GEAR TO TAKE - in a 'smart' daypack. Knives, saws, binoculars, multi-tools.
