Heartland S04E05: Where the Truth Lies

Peter returns to Heartland and Badger starts learning to ride. This episode revolves around Sarah Craven, the town recluse, played by Alberta Watson (a well known actress who had roles in Nikita, The Border, 24 etc.) 

The resolution is 624x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion. This episode aired on CBC on Oct 24, 2010.
