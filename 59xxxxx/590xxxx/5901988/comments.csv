,KickassWashingMachine,2010-12-03T13:24Z,"@FanPIX:

Read what he fucking writes, moron, he says connectABLE, not connectED. And he even gives you a link to help you out. Jeez"
,KickassWashingMachine,2010-12-03T13:25Z,Thank you
,Sharak23,2010-12-11T17:21Z,"why is it the smaller video files, 700mb, get awesome seeders whilst Hi Res larger files like this one get barely no seeders at all?"
,Enverex,2010-12-19T23:25Z,People prefer speed over quality in most cases. That's why 700MB XviDs and 128Kbit MP3s always have so many connections. Sucks for everyone else.
,iniestaaa,2010-12-30T05:43Z,Seed. Seed. Seed. Been downloading this for more than 2 days now.
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-02-02T23:44Z,It's the USA version aprox 83-84 min. The full length version is 104 mins !!! The Voice comment is changed also in content!!
,Taigazz,2011-02-07T03:46Z,"OMG ppl like FanPix.... well, imagine the torrent like this: 1 seeder for each leecher. Now, if there are more leechers than seeders, then some seeders get no download
Also, some leechers have fast internet, which means they can receive more. Some seeders have slow internet, which means they won't seed any. Check your seeding rate: if it's 0 k/Bps, then *%^$ off!!"
