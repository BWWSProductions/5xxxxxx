Joan Veon (1949- Oct. 18, 2010) - When Central Banks Rule the World

Established in 1944 and named after the New Hampshire town where the agreements were made, Bretton Woods I created a system that made the dollar the reserve currency of the world. In addition, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank were established.

Globalization is the process of breaking through the protective barriers designed to separate the nation-states from the world system. Between 1944 and 2008 (BW I and II) all the nation-state barriers have been removed with exception of the national regulatory laws governing financial institutions, insurance companies, mortgages, and Wall Street.

The real purpose of BWII is to establish the framework for a global regulatory system. This also presents the possibility of merging all regional currencies into a global currency.

On the agenda for 2009 is the passing of the Treasury's "A Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory System", which transfer to the Federal Reserve the remaining financial assets of America, effectively gutting our country.
