2010 release, the seventh album fromJazz Funk pioneers Jamiroquai. Fronted by the charismatic Jay Kay, this is the bands first album in five years, following Dynamite with the kind of catchiness that made Jamiroquai a household name. Recorded between Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, and Thailand, Rock Dust Light Star features the single Blue Skies, a Take That-esque uplifting pop songs, a departure from tracks such as Space Cowboy. This record shows the groups talent remains as strong in 2010 as it was in 1994.
