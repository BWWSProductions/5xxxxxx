,thedecking,2010-10-24T09:14Z,"pcfixer123- there won't be any seeders showing until I've seeded the first full copy.  As this is such a big torrent and I can only upload at 100kbs it'll take a day or 2 for enough people to have enough bits for it to get going properly.

Please everyone seed as much as you can.  As soon as I can leave this torrent to seed without me I'll get Lein on Me uploaded.

cbailey-I'm not in Canada and it took me alot of work to find sources for all the Holmes stuff, but I'm happy to share as I love the show.  I'd like uploads of any similar show.  I was always a big fan of this old house but it's not been on over here for 4-5 years, so any recnt stuff would be great.

Mike Holmes is a God!
The only thing that would make this the best show ever would be to find the shyster contractors that screwed up the jobs in the first place and then to film them receiving a vigorous beatdown by Holmes!  It would be kind of like a Dirty Harry reality show."
