,iwilleatu,2010-10-23T04:51Z,are you for real? or is this a lame attempt to poison my pc?
,ghost19,2010-10-23T04:58Z,"guys, update....

If u have already installed the previous crack by reloaded, then download from this torrent only arcania.exe .... except arcania.exe everthing else is the same as the prev crack"
,ghost19,2010-10-23T04:59Z,@iwilleatu -- And it is real and not any attempt to poison ur pc
,iwilleatu,2010-10-23T05:29Z,"no offense man but you know how it is :) they prey on people like me that's been waiting and waiting for this, thanks dling now and will post later"
,iwilleatu,2010-10-23T05:35Z,"ok thanks sorry if i posted twice, comments not working for me"
,wowme,2010-10-23T06:57Z,"@ oxydgen 

Can you also give a link from where you got the hotfix? "
,RanShak,2010-10-23T07:46Z,"Hrm. The crack works, but I'm still stuttering like mad."
,RanShak,2010-10-23T07:49Z,"Yeah, this is exactly the same as the original crack."
,pochoman15,2010-10-23T08:08Z,Si funciono thx bro 
,pochoman15,2010-10-23T08:09Z,thx thx 
,reazonable,2010-10-23T08:33Z,"I have doubts. Can someone respectable confirm that this is, in fact, a crack from rld and it works?"
,iwilleatu,2010-10-23T09:27Z,bs
,D17,2010-10-23T11:57Z,"ok, if u mouseover or right click ->propertis->Details u'll see that the file version still the same 1.0.0 so i doubt its a real hotfix crack, besides u cant find this ""hotfix crack anywhere but here only, sorry if im wrong!"
,ccr123,2010-10-23T12:44Z,"ghost19, how come the version number (D17 post) don't change if this is the real deal? New version with that update is v1.1.0.1385."
,MuttoK,2010-10-23T13:47Z,"Its not real, quit wasting people's time bud..
there really isnt any need for behaviour such as this!"
,Tallsteve,2010-10-23T14:21Z,"100% fake, it is just the original crack. This uploader is a tool."
,insomania,2010-10-23T14:39Z,"To people saying this shit aint real. Have you even tried it?!
I just downloaded it in a few minutes, applied the original hotfix and then the downloaded hotfix crack.
The game works without any struttering on highest settings.

Cheers Ghost19 for uploading the first, highly anticipated hotfix crack!

Keep up the work!"
,insomania,2010-10-23T14:46Z,"*Edit*
If its still not working with only the crackfix, try following the comments on this torrent.

There are a few people who made it work without the crackfix.

Read truther7s and Khaoskidds comments.

,RanShak,2010-10-23T15:50Z,"@insomnia

The reason you've seen a performance increase is because the ProcessManager.xml in this pack has been pre-adjusted with the workaround. Otherwise, this is, bit for bit, exactly the same as the crack that RELOADED packaged with the game."
,cirios8300,2010-10-23T16:00Z,"ghost19    Thank you !
I replaced my files with files from your torrent and the game runs with the same fps but much smooter"
,reazonable,2010-10-23T16:37Z,"This is confirmed to be a crap. It lags like 5% less with a workaround, because if I disable one of my cores, I get such low fps that it lags just as bad. Waiting for Reloaded to crack the real 1.1 exe"

,crazybaby,2010-10-23T17:18Z,This is a magic!! it worked for me greatly!! almost %80 of stutter frameskips dissapeared now!! i finaly can play the game smooth. i realy no idea what did the trick but it really WORKS!!. 
,RanShak,2010-10-23T17:48Z,"You stupid, stupid shits. Yes, it will help stuttering, but the ONLY file that will help is the ProcessManager.xml. Two values have been changed. That is all. The other files are exactly the same as the crack you've already been using. Once applying this, the game will run using a single core. The problem has NOT been solved, it has just been helped. Had ghost19 not been a complete fuckwit about labeling this as from RELOADED, this could have been considered a service. As such, he's just an asshole."
,Lil_LeX,2010-10-23T20:36Z,hidden VIRUS!
,procc1,2010-10-24T14:06Z,"THIS IS FAKE! Want proof ? See Arcania.exe details, it says ""File version 1.0.0.0"". 
Real working crack will say ""File version v1.1.0.1385""."
,truther7,2010-10-26T07:48Z,"All this is  type=""Gothic4Process""  thread-pool-bit=""2"" was changed to  type=""Gothic4Process""  thread-pool-bit=""1

in the processmanager.xml

So if you had video stuttering problems, this should of fixed it. 

I believe it disables the second core of the CPU, if you have a slow dual core CPU the frame rate might not be enough. 

You will notice the difference straight away if you had the video stuttering issues, if not you might see a frame rate decrease. 

It could be that different processor's react differently to the exe and other might not have the stuttering issue, just slow performance.

,computerfromhell,2010-10-28T07:03Z,"YEEEAH, I GOT THE SOLUTION! You need to edit the ProcessManager.xml, but that's only half of the truth. In the ProcessManager.xml, you have to set each and every value for ""memory synchronized"" to true. That's 14 times or so. Next you have to find the line with ""ThreadConfig platform=""PC"" cores=""4"", and set the cores to the number your CPU has.
NOW the important part:
- Start Arcania
- Load a game or start a new
- Now, open the windows Task-Manager by pressing [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[ESC]
- Find the Arcania.exe-Process
- Now, you have to right-click on Arcania.exe and select ""Select affiliation"" (I think it is called this in English, it's the third point from bottom, where you can select the cores the process uses)
- Now, disable all cores beside of ""CPU 0""
- Get back into Arcania (just activate the window)
- Another important part: Now you have to enable all the cores again
- There you have it, much more fluent"
