Password Security:
â€¢ Best protection of your data due to double encryption with Rijndael 256! Your password list is protected twice: with the master password and with an internal key.
â€¢ Protection from keylogging (intercepting of keystrokes) â€“ All password fields are internally protected from keylogging.
â€¢ Password Depot leaves no trace of your passwords in the RAM. So even an attempt by a hacker to use your computer and try to browse the cryptic memory dumps for passwords - a theoretical option - would be defeated.
â€¢ Clipboard protection â€“ Password Depot automatically detects any active clipboard viewers and masks its changes to the keyboard; after performing auto-complete, all sensitive data is automatically cleared from the clipboard.
â€¢ The integrated password generator creates virtually uncrackable passwords: instead of passwords like "sweetheart" or "John", which can both be cracked in a few minutes, you now use passwords like "g\/:1bmV5T$x_sb}8T4@CN?\A:y:Cwe-k)mUpHiJu:0md7p@

Password Management:
â€¢ Friendly and easy-to-use interface, similar to the Windows Explorer, that allows you to navigate the password lists.
â€¢ Top bar window for faster and more efficient navigation. Now available in classic design or as application desktop toolbar
â€¢ Auto-complete action that allows you to automatically complete fields on a web page with user name and password.
