A/10 (Proper 5:1 audio)
V/10
Synopsis: Romantic comedy about a young man who, due to commitment issues, watches as the love of his life walks out of his life.
Really funny Aussie comedy and well worth the download...
Many Thanx to aAF and .BONE. for the Excellent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a fast download...:)"
