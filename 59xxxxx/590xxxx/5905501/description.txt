Deep Sea Detectives: More Secret Underwater Caves - Greater Antilles

For more than a thousand years, the TaÃ­no people flourished on the islands comprising the Greater Antilles--modern-day Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic. Five centuries ago, they seemingly vanished--millions of people gone in the blink of an eye.

The DEEP SEA DETECTIVES team explores the archaeological record, a lost city deep in the jungle, disturbing legends, and secret water-filled caves to learn how a people rich in natural resources could so quickly fall victim to malnutrition and unspeakable violence.

The most sacred of their caves, known as "eyes of the beast", hold artifacts in their murky depths that may reveal the true fate of the TaÃ­no.
