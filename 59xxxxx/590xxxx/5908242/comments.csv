,gizmol1212,2010-10-30T11:59Z,"goes without saying that: this game does NOT work (black screen) it appears no one made it work, it is known to the community that it doesn't work (yet) so don't complain... you have been warned so dont bash this torrent or its author for crappy dump or whatever..."
,spjh1978,2010-11-04T17:26Z,"yep dont boot just black screen ripped from COD MW2 disk and same thing this game will not play 
the only way to play this game is by having the original game lol"
,Skillzzz1337,2011-01-01T19:37Z,dp you have to mod your ps3 to play this game ????
,elcapitan13,2011-01-03T07:30Z,"BIGGEST waste of my time, i wish i woudve known that this shit doesnt work B4 i spent 3 days 2 download!!!!!!@!#$#!~

,antiestablis,2011-01-19T00:36Z,"Anyone tried extracting Iso and then placing the files in the hdd?,because thats what had to be done for hot pursuit to work for me"
,youthanasia21,2011-01-21T07:57Z,"to get this to work you must have a custom firmware that enables backup manager use.

I recommend kmeaws 3.55, but be warned it may brick your PS3 IF you have a PHAT model with 256 NAND.

so google it for more info"
,nzmark,2011-01-26T12:19Z,"I've got solo mode working, its not 100% ideal but it works.

,Ebay42,2011-01-28T17:56Z,BIGGEST waste of my time
,GokkRedfist,2011-02-06T21:42Z,"Modern Warfare 2 wasn't working for a while due to the black screen problem. Just recently though, I have heard with the release of the new Multiman (ver. 15.0 and up) fixed this. Multiman is compatible with most CFWs and while I haven't tried it personally (I will soon enough, got a huge download queue), people have reported MW2 working on their PS3. Do some searching before declaring this a waste of time, you might not regret it! ;)"
,sham021,2011-02-24T08:20Z,"Thank you ""TDXGRP"" it works fine on 3.55.......and to make this work u much use the newest multiman and when lunching the game from multiman u much press SELECT + X.....and now it should work... "

,Fuqthegovt,2011-07-24T10:31Z,"@moeren noone gives a fuck about legal threats. I sure as hell don't. They can sue/arrest me all they want. They'd be wasting their time as I keep my bank acct empty and get paid in ungarnishable cash and if arrested I'll just pick up where I left off when I get out. Alot of providers are in russia/antigua/china/etc so good luck even getting a letter to them, let alone sueing them."
,Fuqthegovt,2011-07-24T10:36Z,"and the problem with ps3iso.com is the same with all dl sites with links, half of the links are broken thanks to DMCA takedown notices. Waste of time sifting thru them. I only use those as a last resort (if it's not available on newsgroups, gamefly, or torrents first)."
