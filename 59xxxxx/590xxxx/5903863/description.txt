Jonsi In Concert

NPR Music's first video simulcast: Sigur RÃ³s' singer in a solo concert, originally webcast live, in video, from Los Angeles on Oct. 17 2010.

The show was filmed live from the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles. The stage is described as a burnt-out warehouse, and much of what happens is done with video projection. But this isn't video projection on a big screen; this is video projection as a set element, more like a live film.
