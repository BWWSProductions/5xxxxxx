Program #3002 - This Old House: Auburndale Project, Part 2 of 16 - Landscape contractor Roger Cook preps for the new foundation of the entry hall by
removing the old overgrown and badly pruned yews. Out back, host Kevin Oâ€™Connor finds
general contractor Tom Silva and lead paint specialist Ron Peik demolishing the sun porch
within the limits of the new national EPA lead law that now affects all contractors working
on houses from 1978 or earlier. Master carpenter Norm Abram and homeowner Allison
Sharma learn more about the grand estate that once occupied the neighborhood by visiting
its original gatehouse, which is now a private home. Tom shows Kevin the progress on the
excavation out front and out back, where Tom has transferred the load from the rear wall of
the house, inbound, to a series of three temporary walls so work can begin. A team of
concrete cutters arrives to set up and begin the process of cutting through the 10â€ thick
concrete foundation walls. After the final cuts are made, they drop out a 16â€foot section of
the rear foundation wall to make way for the new family room addition.
