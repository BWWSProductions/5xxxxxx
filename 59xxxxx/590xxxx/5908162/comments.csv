,tdmk1,2010-10-31T17:30Z,"Just received my work schedule for next weekend and I'm gonna be in Thurso, Scotland - basically as far away from my home without leaving the UK mainland!

This won't affect me capping the MotoGP & F1 on my Sky+ box, but I know there will be next to no chance I'll be able to get a 3G signal up there so I can RDP in to my server and upload it... Basically, I'm saying, the upload will be a few days late next week... :("
