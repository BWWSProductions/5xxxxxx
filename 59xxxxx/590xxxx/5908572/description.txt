Recorded at the San Diego Sports Arena, April 9th 1974, on the last date of the five week U.S. Burn tour. 
Four tracks from this show turned up first on the Perks & Tit vinyl bootleg, issued on the legendary Kornyphone label back in the late 70's. 
For this first official CD release Sonic Zoom tracked down the sound engineer who taped the first hour of the show through the mixing desk, 
and have been able to add extra material (including the missing cut of the band's rock anthem Smoke On The Water), 
all the between song patter, a concluding Jon Lord solo and much improved audio quality. 
This is a single CD set, since the second part of the show has been lost!
