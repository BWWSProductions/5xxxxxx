Bone, you usually do good work and I'm sure I'll get movies from you in the future, but this is unwatchable."

Great job .bone., thanks again!"

I tried a different version and it worked great. I hardly ever have problems with my player, and I know it's configured correctly, so I don't know what it could have been other than the file itself.

But no matter. Not a big deal at all."
