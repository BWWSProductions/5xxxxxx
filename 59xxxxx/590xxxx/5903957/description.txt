In this somber and slow-moving drama, the overbearing mother of six daughters is consumed by the emotional trauma of her husband's death. One daughter is compelled to hang herself when she realizes she will never escape her mother's icy emotional grip. The story is taken from the play by Federico Garcia Lorca.
