Elvis Presley - Rubberneckin' (Paul Oakenfold Remix) [promo].VOB 



HQ promo music video. Recorded at American Sound Studio, "Rubberneckin'" 
would be used in the film "Change of Habit", which was Presley's 31st and 
final movie acting role, and subsequently issued as the b-side of RCA single 
"Don't Cry Daddy". This remix is from "ELVIIS: 2nd to None", the follow-up 
album to Elvis Presley's 2002 album ELV1S: 30 #1 Hits. It is a collection of 
Elvis' songs which didn't make it to number-one (with the exception of 
"I Want You, I Need You, I Love You").
