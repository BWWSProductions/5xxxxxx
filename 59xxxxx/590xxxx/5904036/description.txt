Prey Alone - not regarded as your typical Irish short film! In fact it doesn\\\'t even have a priest as one of the main or supporting characters. No panoramic vistas, no poverty, misery or guilt and it\\\'s not even set in the 1950\\\'s. Prey Alone is a high octane, ball busting, roaring screeming chase movie set somewhere in the near future in a generic city in the USA.
