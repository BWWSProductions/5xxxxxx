[V],twentyforty,2010-10-24T08:16Z,"@Demise69: Regarding Paranormal Activity - CAM is out (probably crappy) but first movie was so bad that I'll skip ""part 2"" altogether.

X Factor Tiggz (770 MB) is out, BX torrent (1GB) is on TPB for seven hours now and have over 200 seeders - something I had few times only. Well, I have ep. 15 and I'll watch it, but I cannot support blatant Hit&Run - as happened when I was crazy enough to up ep. 13... In short - no."
