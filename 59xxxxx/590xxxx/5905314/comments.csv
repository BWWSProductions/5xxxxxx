,KRuZY1,2010-11-16T12:43Z,"Hi deffjam555,

Can you tell me whether this is the ""alternate"" cut, commonly known as the ""throat"" ending, as opposed to the ""throw"" and ""police"" endings? I've seen the latter two versions, but have been searching for ages to find the version that was shown at the Screamfest Film Festival. 

Thanks, K1"
