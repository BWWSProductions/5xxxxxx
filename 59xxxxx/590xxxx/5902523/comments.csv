,banan2k5,2010-10-23T00:33Z,"@Alan1996
Because it's 720p quality instead of XviD."

,PhilLesh12,2010-10-23T09:56Z,"mc_homes is just trying to become trusted, but this only, single file is suspicious.

I am seeding this cenkota torrent with my brand new FiOS 25/25 fiber optic account.

I am loving how fast I can go from 1.00 ratio to 35.00 ratio!

Enjoy the added 25mb/s of speed on this swarm!!!!

,Phobos2005,2010-10-25T06:23Z,"I appreciate your work but why the 1.21 gig MKV files? I understand this is the HD-version. This plays really slowly on my system.

Can anyone put up an AVI of this any sooner?"
