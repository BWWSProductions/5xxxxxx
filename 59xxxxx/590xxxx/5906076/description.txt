Ãˆ il 1962 nel campus universitario situato nella cittadina di Faber. Appena arrivati, Eric e Kent cercano di iscriversi al prestigioso circolo studentesco Omega House, il club degli studenti modello. Rifiutati, non possono far altro che aderire allo sgangherato Delta House, al cui interno spicca la personalitÃ  dirompente e imprevedibile di â€œBlutoâ€ Blutarski. I due gruppi iniziano a fronteggiarsi con feste folli e scherzi pesanti, dando origine a una vera e propria guerra. Minacciati dal rettore di venire espulsi dalla scuola in seguito al disastroso profitto e alla pessima disciplina, i Delta non trovano niente di meglio da fare che organizzare uno scandaloso toga party. Alla festa viene invitata anche la moglie del rettore, che finisce completamente ubriaca tra le braccia di uno dei ragazzi. Cacciati dalla scuola, e quindi destinati al servizio militare, i Delta si vendicano seminando il panico e il caos durante lâ€™annuale corteo cittadino.Un film di puro divertimento con il quale John Landis anticipÃ² il successo e la fragorosa comicitÃ  di The Blues Brothers, prodotto due anni dopo. Principale merito del film resta comunque quello di aver messo in luce l'eccezionale vis comica di John Belushi.

Two freshmen, Larry Kroger (Thomas Hulce) and Kent Dorfman (Stephen Furst), seek to join a fraternity at Faber College in 1962. They visit the prestigious Omega Theta Pi House's invitational party but are unwelcome. They then try next door at the Delta Tau Chi House ("I hear it's the worst house on campus"), where Kent's brother was once a member. They meet John "Bluto" Blutarsky (John Belushi), urinating outside the building. The Deltas "need the dues" and permit Larry and Kent to pledge. They receive the fraternity names "Pinto" (Larry) and "Flounder" (Kent).
Dean Vernon Wormer (John Vernon) wants to remove the Delta fraternity from campus due to repeated conduct violations. Since they are already on probation, he puts the Deltas on "Double Secret Probation" and orders the clean-cut Omega president Greg Marmalard (James Daughton) to find a way to get rid of the Deltas permanently.
After Omega member and ROTC cadet commander Doug Neidermeyer (Mark Metcalf) bullies cadet Flounder, Bluto and Daniel Simpson "D-Day" Day (Bruce McGill) persuade Flounder to sneak Neidermeyer's horse into Wormer's office late at night. They give him a gun and tell him to shoot it. Flounder does not know that the gun is loaded with blanks. He cannot bring himself to kill the horse and fires into the ceiling, but the noise frightens the horse so much that it dies.
In the cafeteria the next day, Bluto provokes Marmalard with his impression of a popping zit. This starts a food fight that engulfs the cafeteria. Bluto and D-Day steal the answers to an upcoming psychology test. However, the Omegas planted the exam stencil and the Deltas get every answer wrong. Their grade point averages drop so low that Wormer only needs one more incident to revoke the charter that allows them to remain on campus.
Undaunted, the Deltas organize a toga party, during which Otis Day and the Knights perform "Shout". The dean's drunken wife, Marion (Verna Bloom), attends the party at Otter's invitation and sleeps with him. Due to the party Wormer revokes the fraternity's charter, and their belongings are confiscated. To take their minds off their troubles, Otter, Boon, Flounder, and Pinto go on a road trip. Otter picks up some girls from Emily Dickinson College by pretending to be the boyfriend of Fawn Liebowitz, a girl who recently died on campus. They stop at a roadhouse because Otis Day and the Knights are performing there, not realizing that it caters to an exclusively black clientÃ¨le. The hulking patrons intimidate the guys into fleeing, leaving their frightened dates behind ("The Negroes took our dates!").
Things go from bad to worse. Boon breaks up with his girlfriend Katy (Karen Allen) after she sleeps with a professor (Donald Sutherland). The Deltas' midterm grades are so poor that an ecstatic Wormer expels them all and notifies their draft boards of their eligibility. Marmalard is told that his girlfriend is having an affair with Otter, so he and fellow Omegas lure the Delta to a motel and beat him up.
Though the Deltas initially give up, Bluto rouses them with an impassioned speech ("Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no!"), and they decide to take revenge on Wormer and the Omegas. Using a rogue parade float, the Deltas wreak havoc on the annual homecoming parade. During the ensuing chaos, the futures of many of the main characters are revealed.
