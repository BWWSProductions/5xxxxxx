,cojon,2012-01-08T20:18Z,"Those of you having difficulty with extraction of exercise files, please take notice.

I have seen people use a program such as Power ISO to mount a virtual drive and then open the ISO on it to access the files. While this works fine for running the .MOV files, the zipped exercise files will not extract from the virtual drive.

To successfully extract the exercise files from the .ZIP format , you must first extract everything (including the exercise file) from the ISO to, say, a folder on your HDD.  THEN, the exercise files will extract just right!

OK?  I see this time and time again, and some people seem incapable of learning this, so back they come to bitch.  Please people, this uploader went to some difficulty just for you.  They get nothing from it except the good feelings of having assisted, so don't get cranky if something doesn't fly just right out of your poor little airport, OK?  

Please consider the price you paid, the inconvenience you suffered over the benefits you might receive.

Price = ZERO
Inconvenience= going to TPB and looking
What you might get= more than ANY store will ever give you . . .

Lets have smiles, not cranks, PLEASE!  Support and encourage the uploaders. 

It became so bad for me that I upload under a different name and Email than I download from.  I have uploader so much to TPB and others yet the teeny, fussy, crybabys got to me and caused this by cranking when I provided problem solving info like above.

You Americans seriously need to relax and accept, and enjoy life more. 

I realize your country no longer compares favorably with other European nations because your greed mongers are eating your wallets dry with things like monstrous health fees and the like and that your government is crazy with piles of unneeded red tape, but it is you, not the government that have made it so. 

Remember, you are the government... it is not a separate entity. If you wish the government top be better, write letters, march in the streets, be active.  Americans do nothing, it seems, but bitch!  In France, as example, the government fears the people--not the other way around.  You see, when someone gets in government and thinks they are a king and can do what they want, we the people, will mass in huge numbers and take them out. So they are afraid of us and our government doesn't cause things we do not want. 

You crabby Americans might try the same thing. It certainly works.                "
