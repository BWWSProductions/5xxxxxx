Magical Mystery Tour is the title of two different 1967 record releases, an LP and a double EP, by the English rock band The Beatles, both of which include the six-song soundtrack to the television movie of the same name. The version released in the United Kingdom (on 8 December 1967) was a six-track double EP, whilst in the United States, the record (released 11 days earlier on 27 November 1967) was an 11-track LP, created by adding songs from the band's 1967 singles. The 11-track LP was later adopted as the official version of the record when The Beatles' catalogue was updated for the CD format.
The soundtrack was a critical and commercial success, being Grammy-nominated and a number-one album in the US, despite the relative critical and commercial failure of the Magical Mystery Tour film.
