,ottoman101,2011-12-14T03:11Z,"I have a Win 7 x64 system and it installs fine, but it says ""standalone license not found"" when it starts up.  I copied the two crack files into the install directory and ran the crack.  It says patching was done, but it still wont work.  Did I do something wrong?  ETABS was not running when I installed the patch."
,mas_hen,2012-02-23T09:12Z,"this is work fine 100%, i have win7 x64 :
- install ETABS (run setup.exe)
- disable antivirus
- copy crack file (ETABSv970.exe) to c:program files (x86)\Computers and structures\ETABS 9
- Run crack (ETABSv970.exe) - and Patch..!
- right klik on ETABS desktop shortcut - tab on Compatability, mark on Run this program in compatability for : Windows Vista, and Apply
- Enable your antivirus
- That's all."

,alesam96,2012-03-06T13:52Z,"Thanks mr.epic for sharing.

mas_hen, I followed your instructions, but when I run ETABSv970.exe a small window pops up. In it the boxes with the text are to big and I cannot see the patch button. I tried to click it, even with keyboard, but it is not possible. Hence I cannot patch the file. 
Any ideas? Tks"
