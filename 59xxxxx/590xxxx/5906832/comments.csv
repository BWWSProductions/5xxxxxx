,bigbopper100,2010-10-24T07:59Z,as anyone tried this???
,rest_ip,2010-10-24T08:23Z,Seems works. Perfomance in crowded locations now pretty normal.
,Arc101,2010-10-24T08:30Z,I'll try it out of being an idiot:P
,Arc101,2010-10-24T08:31Z,"Oh wow i cant its nvidia and ati only, i have intel. I'll retardedly try both >>"
,PeterN2k,2010-10-24T08:45Z,"I found this originally on newvegasnexus.com

actually worked for me quite well (radeon 3850)"
,Likeadidas95,2010-10-24T09:32Z,"yeah .. the original site is newvegasnexus .. 
but the d3d9.dll file is correct .. i downloaded this 
from the other site and i can play with high settings with 30 fps on my 9400 GT !"
,bigbopper100,2010-10-24T09:51Z,do you think this would work for other games? i.e.moh?
,Arc101,2010-10-24T10:20Z,"just used the ATI with my Intel and it actually worked a little. o.o

@bigbopper100, you can try but theres no guarantee from me"
,Arc101,2010-10-24T10:21Z,Actually I'm going to try with MOH like bigbopper100 said. but later.
,Bajsskumpan,2010-10-24T11:08Z,this performance fix fucked up my saves games.. the game crashes when I try to launch them. :(
,Odyssey420,2010-10-24T11:47Z,"ATTENTION!
If you are having problems with the game crashing after you put this in your folder more then likely you have two monitors. it doesn't support two. You need to unplug a screen or disable it in your settings."
,Try_N_Buy_Guy,2010-10-24T11:47Z,"I downloaded this from http://www.newvegasnexus.com/ and so far I've see a serious improvement in the games performance. No more NPC lag, but I did have one strange issue. For some reason, my character suddenly started moving incredibly slow! Then I found how to start moving at normal speed again, but I had to hold down the shift key to do so. I exited game and haven't played since then. I'll keep you posted. But so far, I've gotta say dispited that small issue; the patch is a must."
,Try_N_Buy_Guy,2010-10-24T12:35Z,"Actually, scratch what I said earlier about having to hold shift. I forgot that you have to have caps lock on to run. I strongly recommend using this feature, unless you like moving through vast land at extremely slow speeds. Just a heads up. One thing I did notice thought is when you are in large outdoor environments, it will break up audio and have some graphic stutter for just a moment from time to time. Still beats playing it without the patch."
,xomeryut,2010-10-24T17:03Z,Massive improvement with my ATI 4870 512 MB after using this file. Many thanks.
,treborcracker,2010-10-24T22:57Z,"Wow..works great, definitely improved fps "
,D17,2010-10-24T23:59Z,"Same here, noticable difference, thx uploader"
,wantedkiller23,2010-10-25T01:02Z,"Can this work on other games for instance Lost Planet 2, or MOH, etc. ???"
,spelonkar,2010-10-25T01:45Z,"Iv seen this on other sites including a link for it on gamebrood which has been amazing help for me regarding other game fixes, thanks for getting this up on TPB"
,Arc101,2010-10-25T02:49Z,"NOTE FOR ALL QUESTIONS INCLUDING OTHER GAMES: Yes it can run on most, if not a few selected, games including MOH, Cities XL 2011, Fallout 3, Fallouut NV, Prototype, and most likely others, 

disclamer: NOT sure on directory location required or sure it will work on ALL

I do not own this torrent nor its contents. lol obviously"
,cp0020,2010-10-25T07:56Z,this actually works! i have the graphics set to the max and there was some lag and after this.... perfect! will try on other games. thanks uploader! :)
,jbm0109,2010-10-25T08:00Z,"File is D3D#.dll
Don't bother downloading.
Update DirectX and you'll have the correct file.
Downloading .dlls and dumping them in your system folders is not only potentially risky but completely unnecessary. [Link]http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=2DA43D38-DB71-4C1B-BC6A-9B6652CD92A3&displaylang=en[/Link]"
,Farligsomfan,2010-10-25T23:19Z,"This really works!! used it on my laptop.

specs:

""Copy d3d9.dll (depending on your graphic card) to your fallout new vegas installation directory"" 

Itâs a directx custom made file especially tuned up for Fallout New Vegas and it works extremely well. "
,xomeryut,2010-10-26T02:45Z,"@jbm0109

""This .dll file is essentially a light-wrapper for a 'supported' video card's .dll, which tricks the game into configuring its FaceGen software (which was causing the problem) in a more efficient manner. """
,55range,2010-10-28T09:58Z,Wow  ! It works was getting 20+ fps in the game on high with gtx 460 now 70 fps + . I cant understand how the fix works- 
,Espionage724,2010-10-28T10:44Z,"Meh idk if FPS is even altered at all on my Radeon HD 3200, but it does start up with or without the d3d9 fix."
,latooots,2010-10-29T05:11Z,any chance for a 64-bit version of this?
,Trevayne,2010-10-31T02:02Z,"fucking shitfuck, fuck you azkiller

Heres the original :)

,yesno123,2010-11-05T01:02Z,"After I copy this to my installation directory the game doesnt start. When the launcher comes up and I press play either nothing happens or the launcher just reappears. I'm using an Asus D525 CPU and Ion 2 GPU. I'm experiencing slowdown in crowded areas so I downloaded this. 
Any body know what could be wrong?"
,DriestBiscuit,2010-11-06T02:42Z,I got it from a different site and made my game awesome :D
,xiIix,2010-11-16T10:45Z,"Yesno, gaming on a netbook is rife with woes. I advise you buy something a little more suited for gaming.

This DLL has been around for a while and works wonders. Especially for New Vegas. New Vegas has issues with areas with a high number of NPC's, and this DLL fixes that. I'm running at 1920x1080 with 8xAA, 16xAF, with everything all the way up and it's rock solid at 60fps vsync no matter how heavy the action gets, which is what it should be. Not sure why Bethesda wouldn't fix this issue on their own."
,buzznjackal,2010-11-27T22:08Z,"Fallout.New.Vegas.Update.2-SKIDROW, FPS went up 20-30fps and stuttering around NPCs ceased after using this fix."
