I think its your upload
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5811816/Pinocchio.1940.BluRay.FS.360p.H264
Today i completed about 50% of it(Enough to play starting 6 min of movie).
Now here is my problem. This movie is not Pinocchio. The srt file is of Pinocchio. But the video is of movie 'Percy Jackson And.....'. 
Dont know what went wrong. Can you please help?"
,azrielle,2010-10-23T10:50Z,"Thanks for UP!  It cut my existing DVD Rip file size by ~60% (with my 250 GB HDD, every little bit helps!)."
,skillet92,2010-10-23T10:54Z,"@i_am_sid
if u donot download the whole file !
it always plays a random file which was/is there on your computer!
U need to download the whole file to watch the movie or abt 80-85% of it!"

[V],twentyforty,2010-10-23T11:07Z,"@remy007in: Today everything would be late, maybe 7 hours from now. 16:00 CET. Maybe. I am not good."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-23T11:11Z,"@i_am_sid: Nope. Content is shown by clicking on ""Files"" in upper left page corner. It shows  files in the torrent.

Pinocchio.1940.BluRay.FS.360p.H264.mp4	504.73 MiB
Pinocchio.1940.BluRay.FS.360p.H264.srt	82.08 KiB"
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-23T11:16Z,"@hkoraddi: Yes. Later, approx. 20:00 CET"
,i_am_sid,2010-10-23T12:04Z,"@skillet92
Thanks buddy for the info. 
I too thought so. But the video file is named Pinocchio.1940.BluRay.FS.360p.H264.mp4. Also its file property is different than Percy Jackson...... movie(dvdrip 480p as i remember) i have. 
OK, Ill complete it tomorrow. "
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-23T13:37Z,"@i_am_sid: It sounds bad - ""Nope""... what I meant (before skillet92 revealed the ""secret"") is ""no, torrent is ok, download it full"". Hope I cleared that..."
,lilars26,2010-10-23T14:06Z,Hi 20-40.Hope you feel better.
,rrr_pirate,2010-10-23T17:59Z,"hey man. i download from you everyday. are you by any chance from louisville, ky?"
,i_am_sid,2010-10-24T03:40Z,"@twentyforty
Got it buddy. Ill download it first.
But its really strange to see a movie that dose not exist on your HDD. Dont understand how that happens."
[V],twentyforty,2010-10-24T07:56Z,"@i_am_sid: One of many mysteries, LOL.

@rrr_pirate: Four thousand miles right, one big and one mid-sized pond away from Louisville."
