,xZorrox,2011-08-15T20:37Z,"Instructions for Windows 7 â€“ works 100% guarantee sincerely - in this weird installation torrent
*****Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 (and other versions w7):
1. Extract the game to a folder of your choice with 7 Zip, etc.
2. Select the Â«setup.batÂ» file and change the properties of this file to run in compatibility mode for Windows XP SP3. Apply the change donÂ´t forget.
3. Then run the Â«setup.batÂ» file. Be patient and click ok when User Account Control asks for during the extracting process. [With me Bit Defender detected a potentially virus with the Open All file, and I clean it. Before IÂ´ve already installed clean Open All file in my system]
4. Finally if everything gone all right, you must see a game desktop shortcut and 2 Club game icons. Select the Â«Launcher.exeÂ» file and do the very same procedure as last written in above 2snd paragraph.
5. Finally launch the game. Shoot only with video games, not ever real innocent people.
6. Do not forget to create a Windows Live account to save the game progress or use a pre existing on if you already had created in your system.
More doubts, Google them and use your lazy brain.
PS: donÂ´t forget to say fuck you to Microsoft directors and employees because they made Windows 7 with a lot of hassling flaws to PC normal users.
I had made this little post comment to help because I had the same hassle in installing older but very playable PC game titles, which bypass the nowadays mainstream releases.
Always is a pleasure to share and to help people in Pirate Bay universe."
