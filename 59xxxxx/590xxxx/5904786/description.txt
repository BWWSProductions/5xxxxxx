This is still in her pre-political period, where one could listen to some wonderful folk tales without being forced to listen to political pap that you may or may not agree with. I don't know about you, but a musician's views on world situations leave me empty and sound rather dated after a while. Which is why I like this CD so much. The tunes on this disc all tell a story of their own, taking the listener on many different journeys, and away from the problems of our worldly situations. And these songs will sound fresh a hundred years from now. 
My particular favorite is Ballad of Robin Winter-Smith for no other reason than I love Nanci's vocals in it. Also, Spin On A Red Brick Floor is another wonderful tune on which Ms. Griffith sings of a favorite club of her's located in (I believe) Texas. By the way, she sings the whole first verse without taking a breath! 
I'm not Driving These Wheels could have been an FM rocker, with its driving beat. And the title tune is just beautiful. 
Notice I didn't write much on her lyrics. The stories Nanci tells in these earlier recordings warrant the listener to come up with their own "pictures" as they listen. Nanci's voice, in her prime here, suits the music and words perfectly. 
Once In A Very Blue Moon and the follow up Last Of The True Believers are two of the best folk rock / storytelling CD's out there. 
Nanci at her finest.
