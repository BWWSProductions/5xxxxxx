,jaleo5,2010-10-23T15:51Z,"El archivo pone spanish, å¤šes que no saben ni leer en su propio idioma los ingleses estos?"
[T],despo1ler,2010-10-23T19:34Z,"every1 stop complaining and try thanking the guy for uploading this, it's thanks to ppl like him uploading foreign language copies that other release groups get the video to synch up to an english soundtrack and provide an english language TELESYNCH (TS). if ppl did not upload these foreign copies we would all wait a lot longer for the english version so if you cant say something helpful pls refrain from saying anything at all because you just show your own ignorance and you are more likely to cause people to stop uploading the neccessary raw material that synchers need to make the version you want than to speed its creation by complaining at them. 
 If you are so impatient go  and record a copy at the cinema and upload it yourself."

,maximumrisk2004,2010-10-23T19:47Z,"BTW, why is there a Spanish TS, but its not even in the Theaters in Central America? WTH?"
,maximumrisk2004,2010-10-23T21:18Z,"Great speed so far. I got 85% and...

Audio: 3 (I barely understand a thing and my spanish is very good)

,Shade_Michael,2010-10-24T05:27Z,"Not worried about what you want, idiots, if your going to write a comment it should be on quality or your opinion of the file uploaded. Or as despo1ler says, to thank the user for uploading the movie. Its free jackasses, if you want perfect pay the god damn five to ten bucks an go see it in theatres with a female. You obviously aint got no game mutha fuckas."
,Shade_Michael,2010-10-24T05:29Z,"and telling someone to learn aa different language is retarded. They're using a website built in english. So they probably aint lookin to learn some other language. This is pirate bay, not rosetta fuckin stone idiots,"
