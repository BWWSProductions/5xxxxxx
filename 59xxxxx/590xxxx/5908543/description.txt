.Mad.Mel.The.Rise.and.Fall.of.a.Hollywood.Icon.HDTV.XviD-MOMENTUM

Description: Once Hollywood royalty, Mel Gibson could command $25 million a film, win Oscars, and 
make women swoon, all the while maintaining the image of a friendly family man. But those days 
are long gone. Today, Mel Gibson's reputation is in tatters. In this two-hour special, we go 
inside Mel's meltdown. We start with the tapes that show Mel ranting at his girlfriend and 
spewing racial epithets. Then we'll hear from the people know Mel well--co-stars, directors, 
agents, managers, and church members. And we'll get the views of psychologists, addiction experts, 
and law enforcement personnel who can speak to the current criminal investigation. From Mad Max 
to "Mad Mel," this is the definitive story of the rise and fall of a Hollywood icon.
