Works fine on VLC! Quality, both audio and video are also fine :)

However, this file still will not play on a stand alone divx player. I am getting the HD FORMAT NOT SUPPORTED message.

Something to do with 720 maybe?

Any chance of a normal version in .avi, such as what tvteam and scenebalance were previously uploading?

Thanks in advance!!!"
[T],jonnoel1,2010-11-02T12:29Z,Not sure why it doesnt work on divx....it is only a 720p. HD probably requires 1080 or above. This is in .avi format already.
,mkmacabre,2010-11-03T00:37Z,"Okies,

The previous nine episodes upped by momentum/tvteam/scenebalance all worked on the stand alone divx player as standard .avi files.

I tried converting all available versions of episode ten myself, with some success, but i am still unable to get any version to play on my divx player.

Not sure what the exact problem is but thanks for this upload anyways!!!!"
