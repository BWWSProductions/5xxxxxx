Jimmy's Farm Season 2 (2005)

Jimmy's Farm is a documentary series following the progress of Jimmy Doherty as he follows his dream of running a successful rare breed farm initially specialising in the endangered Essex pig but later branching out into other areas, including creating a nature trail and "guinea pig village" to attract visitors to the farm. Jimmy's youthful good looks and constantly sunny disposition attracted comparisons with Jamie Oliver (an old friend, who partly-funded the purchase of the farm in the first place).
The first (2004) short-run season (four episodes) was followed up with a one-off special, Back on Jimmy's Farm, in 2005, and two further 4-part series, titled Return to Jimmy's Farm (2006) and Crisis on Jimmy's Farm (2007). 30-minute edits from the first season were aired under the title Jimmy's Farm Diaries.

Episode 3

There's a killer decimating the chickens; Porridge the prize boar is out of control; and 800,000 unruly bees are getting agitated. Jimmy's unfailing optimism is tested to the limit.
