It takes full advantage of the Mac OSÂ® X platform, with an intuitive, graphical user interface that makes it easy to bring your ideas to life. And because itâ€™s AutoCAD, youâ€™re working natively in DWGâ„¢ format, so you can easily share files with clients, suppliers, and partners around the world, regardless of platform.

,skateblind,2011-02-04T01:55Z,"How do I ""install"" the crack? Can´t find Package Contents. Seems like Apple ain´t using it no more. "
,SQUARECLOUD,2011-02-04T13:59Z,I've fully installed it all and i had it working for around half an hour then it just quit and a message came up saying it had closed unexpectedly. any ideas ?? 
,rubengarciajr,2011-02-09T08:27Z,FYI: I ran the update and installed it and it still works good.  Update makes it run smoother.  
,rubengarciajr,2011-02-09T08:54Z,After a few seconds however it will close up on you. So I had to un-install and re-install. 
,nocodex,2011-03-30T01:16Z,will autodesk start to bother me?

,erbilgul,2011-07-21T20:22Z,after installation its give error . itsnt working
,mecacarl,2011-08-09T10:21Z,I can seem to prevent Autocad from crashing every 2 to 3 minutes. Can anyone HELP? I've tried uninstalling & reinstalling.
,Kuwoze,2011-08-19T04:26Z,"Downloaded this, followed the ""read me"" file and replaced the 'cracked' sub-file. Launched and then crashed after about 3 minutes. Did many things as running the updates (3) and even trashed it all to re-install; always same thing: runs for 20 seconds to 3 minutes.
Did some digging in Autodesk website and found this: ""AutoCAD 2011 for Mac is currently NOT supported on the Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) operating system.""

Now that was some 10 days ago. Still checking their website if patch is available.
Only statement is new version that will support Lion - AutoCAD 2012 available August 19 2011. No info on how to upgrade though. Would have a 3 minute window for requestâ€¦
Also, my interpretation of the problem is this thing with 'Mission Control' where one has multi desktops opened. Also had same problems with Bell Technical services which couldn't share my screen. I'll be trying re-launch with just one screen. â€“ Lo and behold, stable after some 10 minutes, but don't minimize as will crash when re-opened. 
May be other problems out of my abilities; will just put thing asideâ€¦"
