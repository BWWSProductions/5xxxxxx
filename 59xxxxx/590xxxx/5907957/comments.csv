Since I uploaded this file, I have seeded it up to a ratio of 75.0, yet I am still the sole seeder. :(

If you download this, please help everyone who wants this file by seeding it, at least for a little while. This would help to make it a faster and more accessible download for all. 

Bedankt to the seeders! ~kimeesteres  :)"
[T],kimeesteres,2011-07-24T09:49Z,p.s. Sorry that the audio on this movie is a bit shitty. It does get somewhat better as the movie progresses...
