,DeltaPan,2010-10-22T15:36Z,"^^Try turning the tracker off and use DHT.

Less seed/peers but i called this and stopped TNA for a few minutes, started this and on DHT i shot to my top DL speed 110-124 Kbps on a 1.1Mbit connection, which is basic for copper wire ADSL1.

I'm connectring to 26/22 seed/peer on DHT and getting my top.

Never heard of moviejocky tracker before, maybe it's slowing things down or something, some do balance and slow people down, maybe you're connecting to aggressive clients who have included a system to slow other clients down in the swarm they connect to, so giving priority to users of the same clients in swarm, been happening a couple of years increasingly and even Utorrent 2.0.4 has done this so it becomes more popular, i just kick and ban ones i know are aggressive while DL'ing and my speeds stay up, drop again when i see those sorts of client connect, then i kick and speed returns, happens on all popular torrents these days and to get decent speeds i have to monitor and kick the aggressive ones off to keep my speed up, clients are becoming aggressive on default config and only decent users who config to be fairer, like used to be exclusive to the Bit Comet [Bit Vomit] client used to be, now a lot are including the same systems to gain popularity and gain more users and it really fracks some other clients up among the swarms these days, but i won't adopt the sentiment of installing one of those clients so i end up fracking up others just to get decent speeds, i stick with Azureus and just kick the aggressive cleints and i get my decent DL speeds.

Perace. : )"
