[T],jonnoel1,2010-12-23T07:56Z,"Thanks for the subs links laned130....I myself gave the movie a little higher rating than a 6 though. I thought it was a pretty awesome documentary, but to each his own I guess."
,laned130,2010-12-23T21:08Z,"lol - my pleasure ;-)

Anyway, many thanks for the up, keep fighting the good fight and all that."
