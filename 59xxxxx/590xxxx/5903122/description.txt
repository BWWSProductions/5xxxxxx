Our colleagues at the thepiratebay have had Funky Gibbon stuck on 88.8% for months. Decided to do something about it.

There were two best of music albums for The Goodies - Yum Yum (1997) & Funky Gibbon (200). Yum Yum has 4 extra tracks and I have combined the two albums here (as a couple of tracks on Yum Yum appear truncated);
