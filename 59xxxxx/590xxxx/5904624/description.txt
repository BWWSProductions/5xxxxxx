How to install:

1. Download Magic Disc(if you do not already have 

it).

2. Emulate the ISO using Magic Disk.

3. Install the ISO Game.

4. Once Install is complete, go to your Computer 

and right click and open the ISO you have emulated.

5. Look for the folder within the ISO named 

PROPHET.

6. Copy and paste the Sniper_x86.exe & 

GameDLL_x86.dll to your C:\\Program Files\\City 

Interactive\\Sniper - Ghost Warrior

Play the game.

Be sure to seed. Give thanks to the PROPHET Crew 

for this release.

There is also a map pack included in the ISO, but I 

have not tested that. This game has been tested by 

me on Windows XP SP2 only
