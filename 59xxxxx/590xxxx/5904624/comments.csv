Why Magic Disc? Why not Daemon Tools or as I always use, Alcohol 120%??


feel free to use what you prefer. I personally favor Magic Disc over Daemon tools, simply cause it is free to dl, and my windows 7 is legit. On my xp I, too, use  Daemon  Alcohol 120%. But my anti virus pegs it as a trojan at times, even though it is a false positive, so for the sake of newbies, I suggest magic disk.  the 2 you name are very good programs, but mine are cracked proggies, so I use em on my other pc only"

Installed DX and all that.
Other games seems to work.
Also get a virus warning that the Sniper_x86.exe, which is the game contains a key logger."

Game doesn't work for me.

1st, you asked me why not use the programs you use? Your last comment is proof.  if you followed my instructions, you would not be having this issue, and your madder than a crazed zombie if you think there is a key logger on here. But feel free to report me if so. I scanned the file you accused to be a keylogger. Virus Total scanned it vs 40 up to date anti viruses and it came clean. SO you need to learn what a false positive is & or get a better anti virus"
