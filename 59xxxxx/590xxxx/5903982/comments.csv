,oni4ever,2011-02-03T01:08Z,thnx...nice copy....worked nicely on my Macbook but there was sound problem on my previous HP !!
[T],murdoc47,2011-02-03T10:37Z,"if you have audio problems, make sure you install either K-lite codec pack, or use VLC media player (works on all OS - Win, Linux, Mac, etc.)
the audio uses AC3 codec, so make sure you have it. (winamp usually works, too, but i have my confidence in VLC)
thanks for the feedback!"
