,rayr_1,2010-10-21T17:38Z,Thanks for the up. It sure has a lot of features. Worth a tryout.
,Knight1to1,2010-10-22T01:05Z,Question- it downloads to 99.8% ... then to 100% and it fails- anything I am doing wrong?  Some help would be great.
,Knight1to1,2010-10-22T01:08Z,Disregard- after the 35th try it finally took- thanks!
[V],Slickinator,2010-10-22T01:55Z,i am not sure what happened for you man always do a force recheck on files after a download specially if it says fail cause some of the people that u download from might be giving bad hash pieces and a force recheck lets you make sure u have a full proper download  see if that helps you out and your all very welcome enjoy
