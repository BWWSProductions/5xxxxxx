   One of the most serious issues is clogging up and fragmentation of the System Registry. As a result, applications may \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"freeze\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from time to time, especially during their launch. Is there an easy way to do away with all those slowdowns, hangups, and sometimes even data loss (when you cannot save the document that you are currently working on)? What can novice users (who don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have much time to read piles of books on Windows\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' innards) do to solve the problem and to make their computers as agile as new?
