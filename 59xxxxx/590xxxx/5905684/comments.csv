[T],trialNerror,2010-10-25T03:32Z,"It's awesome that you bring the show so quick, but haste makes waste, and by today's standards these are just crap.  Old school 4:3 ratio and x263 encoding which needs reformatting to play on any other device other than the PC - c'mon, I thought you were suppose to be a veteran at this.  I've been downloading stuff by you for a while, but no more because it is crap.  People like widescreen and like compatibility.  Sure, my versions takes a little longer to be upped, but by all means it's far better than what you bring.  It's sad people will settle for crap."
,macmal5000,2010-10-25T04:23Z,does this work for xbox 360
[T],trialNerror,2010-10-28T04:25Z,"Probably doesn't work on the Xbox 360, either.  Surely doesn't playback on a PS3.  

Try this one here:

PS3 tested and 16:9 ratio."
