IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:Wall Street 2 Money Never Sleeps R5 DVDR..............Thanks 
AUDIO:LAP .......Thanks

Right here we are running late again with this one... anyway we used laps audio as it was the best out and used the russian dvdr. Now once again the r5 dvdr was poor by the normal standard so we think. It was way too dark and colours too strong and also off. Anyway we made a script to fix the colours the best we could and also made it alot brighter... roughly + 10 on brightness alone + we added our normal resize, white balance etc... Now the audio we used laps audio and added the last 3 mins of audio for the credits off the original russian track to make it complete. We also gone for a larger file size due to the runtime of the film being over 2hrs and we wanted to keep a really nice bitrate.

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
