Description:


Master director Shinya Tsukamoto unleashes a wild blend of action and breakneck editing in this third Tetsuo film. The world of mild-mannered Anthony (Eric Bossick) is torn apart when his young son is murdered, and the resulting stress transforms him. Horror strikes when Anthony discovers that his father used human guinea pigs during his scientific experiments for the U.S. military -- and that Anthony may be his father's crowning achievement.

Review:

A badass super-freaky asian flick,if you have'nt seen the first two they are highly recommended if you like sick,weird,twisted shit.If you have'nt seen the first two then you can still watch this one without being lost as this film stands on it's own.Also want to point out that this one is basically all in English except for a little Japanese here and there.
