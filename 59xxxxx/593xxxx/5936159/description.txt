PLOT

It's  a  year   that  many  have   prophesied  will  bring   a
catastrophic end to life as we know it.

Whatever is in  store - a  massive cosmic collision,  a global
environmental disaster, an Armageddon-like religious showdown,
or a more subtle transformation - many believe that 2012  will
mark a major shift in the  history of our planet. But what  is
there to substantiate such fears?

A detailed, historical investigation of this chilling prophecy
is  the  mission of  Nostradamus  2012 -  an  exciting History
special that  casts the  doomsday warning  in a  frighteningly
modern context.

December 21, 2012 is bearing  down on us with alarming  speed.
Whether or not we are  able to collectively heed the  warnings
and affect  a course  to avert  disaster may  be the  defining
moment of the modern age.

CAST

Vincent Bridges  ....  Himself - Historian
