[V],twentyforty,2010-11-04T11:43Z,@DSIN: Thanks for correction. Stupid mistake.
,skillet92,2010-11-04T12:04Z,Thanks for your efforts! :)
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-04T12:33Z,"""Thank you for efforts"" sound like ""Nice try, but ...""

Simple Thanks is definitely more  polite thing to say, in absence of some verbal inspiration. Words Please and Sorry seems as forgotten ones."

,justregged,2010-11-04T15:20Z,"Thank you for doing this and so fast too, if i can do anything in return let me know. Downloading now and seeding. oh and +1 cheers"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-04T16:26Z,"@qwersd: In my comment (answer) there to lilars I and as in long version of Description which is posted every single day, I have recommended installing Core AVC and DivX. Both have fastest DirectShow filters for a/v.

What player would be used then - is matter of personal preferences. I've said too that I use fastest - Windows Media Player and that Media Player Classic is maybe equally good for some people. And - DivX come equipped with own player (which will use mentioned DivX filters).

However, I am surprised, that people use shit as ddshow or K-Lite or CCCP packed crap - and majority already have installed perfect Matroska player (if one installs AC3 filter) or MP4 player which is 6.8 TIMES faster - DivX player, pure gold, and WMP is a part of OS already."
[T],qwersd,2010-11-04T17:32Z,"thanxxx...
i used 2 use k-lite mega codec pack but after installing ur pack, quality seems to be better (according 2 me).."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-04T17:56Z,"@qwersd: Look, do not get this wrong way, but it is not JUST about quality. CPU consumption is 12.4 - 22.8 TIMES lower. It makes substantial difference. Quality is unbeatable, and cannot be compared to anything. In terms of quality this combo is worlds apart, maybe your playback system allows not to see it in full glory or your level of knowledge and needs are limiting factor. "
