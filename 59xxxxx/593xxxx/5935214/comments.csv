,nice_guy_eddie,2010-12-30T14:57Z,"Hello there, maybe are you gonna say that I'm
stupid, but really, I can't figure how to install this; I mean: HOW can one replace the original file with the crackfile?
Can somebody help me out here, please!?"
,nice_guy_eddie,2010-12-30T18:56Z,"OK, it's working now - obviously I own an 'activated' version now, BUT there's still one major problem: I can't manage to activate both DVD and Blu-ray functions, and, as a result, I am not able to create a menu as well....!"

For all those that cant figure out how to install- Go to Computer-Local Disk C (or which ever holds program files)-Program Files-AVS4YOU and place crack in AVSVideoConverter folder, make sure to relpace the existing file.  Hope that helps...... 
C:\Program Files\AVS4YOU "

I have used various converting programs but found this to be the best.

It even converts MOV to any format you like. 

Must try."
