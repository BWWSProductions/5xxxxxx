It is here only for archival. If you are new to F4UBCD you should search for the
latest version. Due to TPB's current missing "edit" functionality, I can't come back
to edit the latest version into each torrent. F4UBCD is now on Facebook:

In this boot CD are the most popular and useful tools anyone would ever need. The best of the free software, the best of the commercial software, and it all fits on one CD-R that's readable by any computer worth booting on. Not everything can read a DVD, and USB booting is hit and miss at best.

This is actually the third internal rendition of the Ultimate Boot CD that I've used myself. It's been part of my toolbox for years. But with the release of Hiren's BootCD 9.7, the entire playing field has been shifted, with the new MiniXP boot functionality. It's a 30mb image that loads and decompresses into RAM, then boots Windows off RAM at lightning speed - including reading to RAM, it appears to boot even faster than off a hard drive... and still gives you network (and internet) functionality. Its only downside is its limited driver support - that means no SATA support for you!

That's where UBCD4Win comes in. Backed by the latest version of DriverPacks.net MassStorage drivers, it contains drivers for practically every RAID, IDE, or SCSI device to date. Excellent for cloning or imaging, cleanup, removing viruses, etc. Its remote registry system allows you to run a diagnostic program like Sysinternals Autoruns, right there off the boot CD.

Got VistAIDS? Nuke your drive with DBAN (Darik's Boot And Nuke), or use Victoria (part of Hiren DOS-mode) to diagnose and repair your physical hard drive and restore bad sectors to operation. Or if you're still a slave to Vista, you can use the Vista recovery functionality to boot into the first phase of Vista setup and access the recovery functionality.

There are hundreds of tools on this disc, both under the Windows side (Hiren's side and UBCD4Win's), like Active File Recovery and Victoria for Windows, and the DOS side, like Acronis Disk Director and Active Password Changer to bolt-cut a Windows login password.

Once you dive into this disc, you'll never need another boot CD.
