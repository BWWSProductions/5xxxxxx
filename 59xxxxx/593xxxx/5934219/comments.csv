,matesio,2010-11-04T20:21Z,THX..for your torrent !!..run to Win 7/32x
,JoeMaximum,2010-11-05T13:21Z,v3 had trojan in the excel shortcut ... is this one still infected?
,HMNBNG,2010-11-05T14:07Z,"@JoeMaximum

v3 didn't have a trojan, nor does v4.  It was a false positive.  Verify this by uploading it to virustotal, which tests it against ~50 fully updated virus apps."
,JoeMaximum,2010-11-05T15:21Z,"Why would a false positive be detected in a shortcut file ??

Plus , the uploader is ""anonymous"" so its not like he can be 100% trusted ..."

,johnmcarr,2010-12-22T20:20Z,"@LosersWhoThinkThisIsInfectedWithAVirus:

If you're so concerned about viruses, trojans, and rootkits, why the HELL are you on a torrent site to begin with?"
,T4,2010-12-25T16:56Z,"the best one so far, very easy to use  thanks a lot"
,Chasenuva1,2011-01-05T03:46Z,"VIRUS! VIRUS! VIRUS!

when i downloaded this, i was instantly struck by a virus that locked all of my programs. games, apps, ANTIVIRUS, etc. ALL GONE!

DO NOT DOWNLOAD UNLESS YOU WANT A VIRUS!"
,HMNBNG,2011-01-06T22:32Z,"@ Chasenuva1

According to you this app has ""a virus that locked all of my programs. games, apps, ANTIVIRUS, etc. ALL GONE!""

If true then the same thing would happen to the 10s of thousands of other people who have downloaded this app which has over 500 seeds?

Like I said before this app was tested against dozens of antivirus apps so there isn't a virus, and certain not one as malicious as you claim.

Either something else messed up your computer or you made it up, perhaps you work for Microsoft or simply dislike piracy."
,immapirateyay,2011-01-23T00:30Z,"Works great on windows 7.

NO virus, scanned with Avast.

I tried putting the files on a thumb drive, and copying them over to my windows 7 desktop to use, but it didn't work, so I'm re-downloading on this comp. I'll let you know if it'll work on my desktop."
,immapirateyay,2011-01-23T00:31Z,"Oh, and THANK YOU - I desperatly needed Word for my ...stuff. ;)"

,blackblah40,2011-08-16T19:42Z,"I loaded up Excel no problem, when I attempted to click on ""Help"" (which I know now is not included) my AVG detected a threat it called ""Generic20.BHRU"" in the ""Microsoft Excel 2007.exe"" and subsequently quarantined and deleted it.

I'm certainly not claiming this is a serious threat, perhaps its something benign I don't understand. Just thought I'd let people know and possibly get some feedback. :)"

,zuperduperboi,2011-10-24T20:01Z,"@ blackblah40
Tonnes of harmless downloaded installation files will be misinterpreted as threats by conventional Anti-Virus programs; just because they do doesn't mean they'll damage your computer. It's really just a means of eliminating any and all risks to secure the reputation of the Anti-Virus software: there's nothing worse for an Anti-Virus than having infected computers to its name. 

GREAT torrent by the way, I recommend it wholeheartedly. This beats even ""thethingy""."
