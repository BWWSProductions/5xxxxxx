MVB Embarcadero lies in a space between the nineteenth-century grotesque sans-serif and vernacular signage lettering drawn by engineers. It conveys credibility and forthrightness without pretense, making it a most versatile typeface, capable of delivering any kind of message without getting in the way. The family originated in a very different project: in the 1990s designer Mark van Bronkhorst began digitizing a blocky slab serif from the Victorian era, which was then set aside. When he later revisited the design, its outline evolved and took on curves that echoed the rigid skeleton of the original, eventually becoming a complete text sans-serif family while maintaining the subtle eccentricities of its inspiration. Embarcaderoâ€™s OpenType Pro set of 20 fonts contains two widths and five weights, each with italics, small caps, a full set of figures, bullets and arrows, and support for most Latin-based languages.
