Plot summary

Pickaxe

An eclectic mix of activists take a stand to protect an old growth
forest from logging at Warner Creek in the Willamette National Forest
of Oregon, blockading the logging road and repelling the State Police.
Over months a community builds around the illegal blockade as it develops
into the Cascadia Free State and similar actions spread across the region.
Years after its release, Pickaxe has become a classic document of the
potential for grassroots direct action to achieve victory against the
forces of both government and big business. Lovingly crafted by the
participants themselves, the film expertly presents every moment, from
confrontation to celebration. Includes new commentary track by filmmakers
Tim Lewis and Tim Ream. [94 min.]

Breaking the Spell

An hour-long look at the 1999 Seattle WTO protests and the anarchists who
traveled there to set a new precedent for militant confrontation, this
documentary picks up where Pickaxe left off. Filmed in the thick of the action,
including footage that aired nationally on 60 Minutes, it captures a moment
when world history was up for grabs. Includes new commentary track by filmmakers
Tim Lewis, Tim Ream & Sir Chuck A. Rock. [63 min.]

The Miami Model

Against the prescribed template of paramilitary oppression, information warfare,
and profit above all values, activists converge in Miami to demonstrate grassroots
resistance, creative action, and international solidarityâ€”a clash between competing
visions of globalization, soon to be known as the Miami Model. Indymedia activists
shot hundreds of hours documenting the 2003 FTAA protests in Miami and shaped it into
a documentary that cuts through the mass media blackout to reveal the brutal repression
and assault on civil liberties that took place, as well as the inspiring alternatives to
capitalist globalization that were also in full effect in Miami. [91 min.]
