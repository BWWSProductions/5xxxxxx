A practical way to think about money today
Author and CNN veteran money correspondent Christine Romans believes we should live by three qualifiers: living within our means, living with less debt, and being less vulnerable. While some may say this is old-fashioned, today it's hard to argue with Romans' view.
Smart is the New Rich explores how adopting a new approach to money can lead to a healthier financial lifestyle.
