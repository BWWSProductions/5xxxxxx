,Dr_Nick_,2010-11-04T02:07Z,Any chance someone could upload the album in FLAC? These MP3s are high quality but I'm one of those lossless fanboys.
,Carstuar,2010-11-07T10:25Z,"I ripped my copy to FLAC, but I'd prefer if you bought the album to support the artists."
,TheBombio,2010-11-12T22:31Z,"Safe torrent.
Great quality.

Great album. Thanks!"
,Ragrappy99,2010-11-20T02:02Z,"Great torrent, thanks!

Will be buying this as direct download when it's released in the UK, great album."
,Sideswift,2010-11-24T18:00Z,"Nicely organized, nothing unnecessary.
Great thanks!"
,Sideswift,2010-11-24T18:03Z,"I'm just wondering why a few of the filenames and Track Name's are cut, the last few letters are missing. O.o"
