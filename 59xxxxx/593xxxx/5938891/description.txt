For ten-year Jess's life long struggle. He is off to school, his parents can not 

afford to buy the newest and coolest toys for him and Janice from the eighth grade 

is constantly looking for him. But then one day the girl Leslie moves in next door 

and she is also different and outside. They become fast friends and begin to explore 

the woods around their house. Together they create a monstrous fantasy land they 

call Terabithia, where they fight gnober, giants and other fantasy creatures.

In Terabithia can handle everything, and suddenly the everyday problems are no

longer invincible. But the greatest adventure of all is still waiting for Jess ...

The film is based on the classic fantasy book "The Secret State"

by Katherine Paterson (winner of the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award 2006)

and is ideal for large and small with imagination intact.
