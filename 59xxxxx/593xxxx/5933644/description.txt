Note:This torrent fixes problems that affected previous two versions. 

* Issue with episode 4: Greece. Previously the audio simply died at 42:57 minutes into the show as reported by drhank. 
* Issue with episode 3: Aegean. Audio became dramatically out of sync.as reported by Moorgandowe.

I've now gone through and listened to the end of each episode to ensure there are no similar audio issues.

For those who downloaded the previous torrents and only need the fixed Episodes 3  and 4 please see this tutorial explaining how to download specific files within a torrent -
