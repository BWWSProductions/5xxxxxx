,chancey2,2011-04-03T20:43Z,"Don't make stupid comments like ""the bitrate is 2400/2700 kbps 96KHz and 24 bits"" since bitrate has little bearing on the quality of the sound.

I haven't listened to the digital production yet but even on mediocre equipment I can hear this sounds like garbage. The crackling and popping from the vinyl is irritating but the worst thing is the separation and general instrument presentation which is pretty much nonexistent, it sounds like its being broadcast down a phone line.

It's likely that the vinyl edition has gone through different mastering than other formats like CD so if your looking for the best pure sound quality, stick with the lossless digital editions.

Unless you enjoy the sound of vinyl don't be an idiot and download this because there are ""impressive"" numbers attached."

Too bad i didn't read your comment before i downloaded it :-(
It realy is waste of time and quality is realy poor with distracting noises."

,Puranti,2012-03-04T15:14Z,"Exceptionnal quality for a vynil, thanks a lot !"
,MixedUpZombie,2012-03-31T15:47Z,"THIS rip is a perfect 10/10! Of course because it's a vinyl record rip it has minimal audio crackles, but the sound is just so clear! you can make out every sound made by every instrument, instead of it being a cluttered mess like in all the other CD rips. Christopher Nolan, Hans Zimmer and Vinyl FTW"
