,pogogogo,2010-11-05T08:22Z,"For years now this man has been uploading movies, that too around 700 Mb. He's getting closer n closer to be the best in the torrent world. People have come n gone, but lets see if FXG can stay long enough to be on the top "

,free2flie,2010-11-05T22:59Z,"@pogogogo
WTF are you saying man? FXG is already the top. aXXo is frikking gone and even aXXo didn't include subs with all his uploads. So STFU

@FXG_Team: You guys are seriously amazing. Don't listen to shits like pogogogo; you guys are already the top. Keep Rockin'"
,bragazar1710,2010-11-06T00:07Z,thanks.
,dkhere,2010-11-06T17:09Z,It would be better if you start uploading 720p versions of all the movies with 700MB size...
,jayness,2010-11-06T18:08Z,"FXG_Team, thank you so much!!! This IS a classic trilogy and I am happy to download it!  I have always enjoyed FXG's torrents, and they will upload what they want, FXG is the uploader, not any haters on the internet.

FXG is the best movie uploader on torrent sites.  Keep doing what you are doing FXG, you are doing a great job!!! 

pogogo, you don't know what you are talking about, if you are stating that, because clearly FXG is the top uploader for movies, even if he doesn't last, take what you can, while it is here, that is why you should be thanking FXG_Team"
,Haatspraak,2010-11-08T01:58Z,"jeez @free2flie, calm down, @pogogogo only stated something, he didn't badmouth anyone, wow, obviously you are very smarter than he is (sarcastic) and you just have to show it off. And BTW ""but lets see if FXG can stay long enough to be on the top"" was stated in a rhetorical sense. Live and Let Live @free2flie (BTW it's not 'flie' , and I don't realy know of any reason why spelling it like that would seem cool, keep words they way they are supposed to be ---> Fly "

Someone told me, to be careful not to download the first ones."
,syedms25,2010-12-05T07:23Z,Great downloads as ever FXG_team. Could you upload FX Murder by Illusion movies please?
