,alfb,2012-01-06T21:46Z,"Please HELP!  I don't know why I can't open this application.  I'm new to some of this so I'm sure there's nothing wrong with your application.  Everytime I click ""open"" it asks me what program I'd like to use to open it with.  HUH?  Then it only gives me the option of Windows Media Center.  HUH?  I have no clue how to get this started.  Please HELP SOON.  Thanks."
