"Gentleman's Intermission"

When Avery (guest star Elizabeth Banks) points 
out the peculiarity of Jack (Alec Baldwin) and 
Liz's (Tina Fey) bond, he vows to set some 
boundaries. With Jack keeping his distance, 
Liz is left to deal with her father's (guest 
star Buck Henry) attempt to recapture his 
youth during a visit. Meanwhile, Tracy (Tracy 
Morgan) enlists Kenneth's (Jack McBrayer) help 
to reinvent himself after viewing his own pre-
produced video obituary. Much to Jenna's (Jane 
Krakowski) dismay, she finds out that no one 
has shot her video, so she decides to make it 
herself.

Enjoy :)
