Customized:

 I have uploaded this torrent for the purpose of sharing with friends or anyone else who enjoys Bucketheads music. 

As this is a personal collection, I have adapted it to my tastes and a small number of songs have been removed simply due to the fact I had never listened to them more than once. 
 There are 100s of songs in this collection and I have kept the songs which I enjoy (which is around 95% of 850 files) so you are really not missing anything from the songs which have been removed.

 The majority of them were either samples from movies, voice samples from other artists, obscure 5-10 second beats or riffs, or extremely experimental material which just wasnt to my taste.

All these songs can easily be found elsewhere however if you do still want them.



I have removed renamed all songs to simply;

 Buckethead - *Track Title*

So the track numbers are no longer in the filenames, but the information is still embedded within the files and can be seen in any media player.


All in all, this is an amazing collection of music by a brilliant, but underrated artist. It is very unique and even more diverse.
