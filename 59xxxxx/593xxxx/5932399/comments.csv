,frostoriuss,2010-11-20T02:55Z,hey can you make a companion torrent with the rest of the tracks u didn't put on this one.  this torrent was amazing but i was dissapointed that it wasn't all of them
,MJP_III,2010-11-22T18:40Z,"I agree with frostoriuss, it would be EXTREMELY appreciated if you made a companion torrent with the missing tracks. It's those tracks that really show the thought process and musical creativity of Bucky; plus, it helps for us perfectionist who want ever second of music in our collection. ahah. Either way, AMAZING torrent. Thank you."
,MJP_III,2010-11-22T22:00Z,"please seed, it's a pretty large torrent... thank you! :)"
,greenmilk,2010-11-23T19:40Z,"great torrent, thanks a lot! 
( don't like you removing songs tho *angry face*)"
,TombRaiderAddict,2010-11-28T23:17Z,"Great artist, thanks"
,Barroquecore,2010-12-02T00:11Z,"Thanks a lot, man. I understand you taking away some songs. I used to be one of those people that wanted to have every song even if I didn't really like it or was really just nothing interesting just for the sake of feeling like the collection was complete, but I've let go now and I appreciate what you've done. "
,Ghost_Face,2010-12-04T02:15Z,"Thanks for the feedback. 

As it says in the description, this torrent was originally made for a friend and was never meant to be totally complete.

I also used to want every possible song he has worked on but in the end there were simply too many, so I was left with this.

I may upload the remainder of the songs, but there are still some songs/albums missing which I still need to acquire. Would also like to extend the Live Versions folder with multiple versions of each song.

Thanks"
,QuidoDeUltor,2010-12-20T12:25Z,"Thank you very much! In my country it can not be bought and even over the Internet. Thanks again Ghost_Face!
Pirathebay rules !!!"
,gascan719,2010-12-25T00:40Z,"Can I ask why only one album is in a different format? Captain EO's Voyage is in .M4A instead of, like the rest of the torrent in .MP3?  The rest of the torrent is fantastic. And much appreciated."
,Ghost_Face,2011-01-10T00:13Z,Captain EO's Voyage is .m4a as it was bought from itunes directly and I do not have conversion software. It should work if played in iTunes or VLC Player.
,decepticonjon,2011-01-15T19:08Z,this is a big pile of shit torrent with crap encoding and missing files.  
,Ghost_Face,2011-01-31T20:01Z,"@decepticonjon

Does exactly what it says on the tin."

,Goblikon,2011-05-05T17:42Z,"Thanks ghost, heard one of his songs on a youtube video and had to have more"
,kyslip,2011-05-06T22:34Z,didnt see any science faxtion . and you only have the first praxis album. i got a boner when i saw the description but was disapointed.. other than the false description . well done
,Lymesloop,2011-05-16T19:07Z,"I think this is a great upload. Some of the criticism pointed out here is pretty pointless as they could get what they want or think that is missing somewhere else. It's not that hard, really.

But again, thank you!!!"
,Pronotypo,2012-01-20T05:44Z,"Thanks, Ill seed such a good torrent"
,theOPgamer,2012-02-08T07:27Z,"Dammit, Buckethead is the only artist i ever knew who actually wanted to buy music from legit. After i get this i will not rest till i know a hard copy of every CD he has ever released...."
,bostriff,2012-04-20T19:20Z,"seriously this torrent sucks ass, not only are there missing files but why the hell would you rename all the songs to ""artist - title"" format instead of the ""track.nr - title"" format? Now all the files won't be sorted by track number in the playlist. "
