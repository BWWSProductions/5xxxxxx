,holdercj,2010-11-04T17:21Z,everytime I try to download I get a 404 error.  Looks like the link to the torrent is broken
,tacosamurai1,2010-11-04T18:23Z,"@ paul62285
soft modding is for the weak and hopeless
real men get wiikeys..."
,cb8709,2010-11-04T19:06Z,This game is fun as hell online. Wii WFC doesnt lagg a bit! Way better than the conduit multiplayer.
,goffyoflegend,2010-11-04T19:24Z,"@tacosamuria...........
why would you spend money on a chip when you can do exactly the same thing for free by softmodding? (well, for the cost of an SD card)
real men? muppet!"
,quirkynature,2010-11-04T20:14Z,"Downloads MAD fast, works perfectly on USBLoaderGX AND Neogamma.

@tacosamurai1, what goffyoflegend said. "
,SpitvenoM,2010-11-04T23:48Z,"@tacosamurai1

i have got a wiikey and i have soft modded my wii i have no use for the wiikey anymore because soft modding does a better job then wiikey i think you are a bit behind with the times hailing wiikey this is 2010 and we have things like wiiflow and other badass homebrew that you cannot get through the use of just a wiikey."

Im seeding at 2mb/s and downloading at 0.2kb/s!

Cmon guys, dont be selfish. After it finished downloading, let it seeding for a few more hours!!"

,tulsafag,2010-12-24T18:30Z,"Eureka!!!!!!!!!!!
I just discovered that if you get the "" won't work "" message while trying to load  into WBFS manager, then just DELETE the TORRENT from UTORRENT. I know it makes you a hit and run leecher but its the only way to get some games to load. Damn all those games I downloaded only to delete without getting it to work. IF I  had discovered this last year???????"
,NightcrawlerGT,2011-01-11T03:30Z,links broken.... could any one re upload plz
,taarna23,2011-01-11T21:53Z,Use the magnet link. It works fine.
,Leechless,2011-01-14T03:56Z,"@ Tulsafag,
The discovery you made is not so much of a discovery, but basic knowledge. While you are seeding, your file cannot be modified, only viewed and copied. Deleting the torrent from your program stops the seeding process, so only remove it once you feel you are finished seeding."
,lavalord1111,2011-01-17T02:17Z,plese seed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,lavalord1111,2011-01-17T02:36Z,dyXribo try changing the iso setting for the game in wiiflow
,Roanin,2011-01-28T12:24Z,"@tacosamurai1
By ""real men"", do you mean the muscle-heads with half a mind to NOT waste money, when other options are available with cheaper resources?
Because that's what it sounds like."
,trylan,2011-02-05T02:47Z,any idea why theres no file coming up when the torrent comes up in u-torrent?
,Selim873,2011-02-05T18:49Z,"Cmon guys, seed... my speeds are jumping between 40kbs thru 115kbs, I normally download at 1MBs..."
,NecroFile,2011-03-01T02:37Z,This just locks up on a black screen when loading from the latest version of CFGUSBLoader.
,thorick89,2011-04-03T02:40Z,"I Have Tried This Torrent And It Did Not Work.
I am Using WiiKey 2 on 4.3U and I Found a Working Goldeneye 007.
If You Are Having Any Problems Google “James_Bond_GoldenEye_007_USA_WII-PLAYME”
 The File Size Is 4.33 GB and I confirm it to Work 100% On WiiKey 2."
