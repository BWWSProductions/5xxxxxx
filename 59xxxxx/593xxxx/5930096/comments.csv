,SpeedItUp,2011-01-13T12:25Z,"Sorry to say this but. Season 2 is still going, the episode 14 is not an episode, the real episode 14 is called Back to the Shore, an thats released 6 January 2011.

So this is only half the season."
,Thizzy007,2011-01-14T08:59Z,"@SpeedItUp, actually this is the complete second season, as advertised. The one that aired on Thursday January 6th 2011 is the season 3 premiere. There is 13 episodes in season 2 and then the reunion show included, the bonus, is the 14th.

,Thizzy007,2011-01-14T12:16Z,"Meh, it is regarded as a continuation of season 2, but it is officially season three.. If you are into technicalities and not into expressing gratitude, please keep neglecting to thank the uploader."

,darkbyke,2011-02-26T07:02Z,"Well obviously if you're using that rationale, then TV shows are all just a continuation of season 1...... my god some people are dumb.  They are on a NEW SEASON #3 now.  "
,longz,2011-03-12T14:05Z,"hey the PDTV episodes don't work, is there another way to watch it ?"
