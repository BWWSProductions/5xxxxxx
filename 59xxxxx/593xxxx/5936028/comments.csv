,BjWeihe,2010-11-27T08:22Z,"Yes People, now AVG's New Update Blocks this from working and claims that its a virus.
But too all you people saying these files are infected or viruses, NO THERE NOT!
Its just avg making you have to pay for there shit."

,ind3x1,2010-11-28T18:41Z,THERE IS A TROJAN IN THIS FILE!
,otter2208,2010-11-29T18:49Z,I get this error now - this program can't start because aushelper.dll is missing  What did this program do to my computer??????
,otter2208,2010-11-29T19:08Z,I uninstalled and tried to install again and now I get; An error occured while loadin library commonforms.dll::Register Windows  It may have been removed. Please reinstall the application.  OK - So what do I do now?
,Kellyrose,2010-11-29T21:48Z,"Can someone please tell me if this is safe to use?? AVG Anti Virus 2011 just detected the aushelper.dll as a Trojan Horse.  Does this contain keylog, should I wipe my computer now?"
,rolls7s,2010-11-30T03:16Z,Works great.  If using AVG Internet Security try to disable Resident Shield as it blocks the files needed to run program.  Install as noted.
,otter2208,2010-11-30T21:20Z,OK this is what happened - If you use AVG as antivirus it will say its a trojan (false) and you cannot use it.  If you use a different antivirus you are free to use it.  AVG doesn't want you to use a cracked version is all. I unstillaed my AVG & since I have Comcast internet I got Norton free and reinstalled and works perfect.  It is AVG trying to crackdown on the cracks LOL.  This is safe.  Hope I helped
,ashpool1,2010-11-30T23:20Z,"Question- once you use cracks and mess with your registry files, can u still use a registry cleaner?  Will it screw up all your cracked software?
Thanks, if anyone can help."
