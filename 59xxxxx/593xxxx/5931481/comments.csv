Press any key to continue . . .

It's saying that the command line you used said to use those parameters to launch the class net.minecraft.LauncherFrame, but it can't find that class. I've been trying to get cracked minecraft to allocate more memory but so far no luck.

P.S. You don't even need the command line to launch this. You can just run the exe. The net.minecraft.LauncherFrame error seems to be fixed with 1.6.6 being out."
,cybersteel8,2011-06-04T21:24Z,"I'm still getting the ""can't find net.minecraft.LauncherFrame"" problem and I had this updated to 1.6.6 yesterday. I deleted the .mincraft folder from C:/Users/myusername/AppData/Roaming but that didn't fix the problem... any help guys? I loved playing this I don't wanna stop!!!"

,bew1117,2011-08-28T06:49Z,"I was getting that problem until I changed my hosts (or added) to this:

127.0.0.1 www.minecraft.net
127.0.0.1 minecraft.net
127.0.0.1 194.28.157.42   

I don't know if that will cause any problems, but that's the only way I can get it to run."
,SwordOfWar,2011-10-11T15:18Z,"Minecraft Smart Launcher doesn't have the out of memory problem.

You can get it here:

It's better than MinecraftSP.exe"
