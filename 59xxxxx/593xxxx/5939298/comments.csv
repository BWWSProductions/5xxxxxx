Cudi promises that the album will be darker than its first, and will
build on the cinematic theme that he prides his music on."
,rayne117,2010-11-11T22:35Z,I'm loving this right now. Definitely going to buy the album online soon; gotta give this brilliant young man his money.
,rayne117,2010-11-11T22:37Z,"And SoftWarez, he isn't a douche for not liking the album.

Read, ""There's no
question that the album will be well-received by critics and fans...""

He just doesn't like it, no harm here. Sit back and listen to the greatness."
