Release Notes:

Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi AKA Kid CuDi is one of hip hop's biggest
stars; Grammy nominated with a Top 4 Billboard album and the star of a
HBO series 'How To Make It In America'.

'Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager. The highly-anticipated
album features the likes of none other than Kanye West, Mary J. Blige
and GLC, with production from Emile, Plain Pat, Jim Jonsin, Diplo, Dot
Da Genius and others.

Cudi promises that the album will be darker than its first, and will
build on the cinematic theme that he prides his music on. There's no
question that the album will be well-received by critics and fans
alike, so the only question that remains is: where will you be for the
revolution?
