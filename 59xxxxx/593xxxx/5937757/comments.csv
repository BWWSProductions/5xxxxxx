,patriotic,2010-11-06T12:25Z,Movie is ok but the audio is out of sync
,leonhennessy,2010-11-06T12:58Z,yeah audio is out of sync by a few seconds
,faaaaq,2010-11-06T22:59Z,"the audio sync is easily fixed while playing in any media player on a computer, and also not too hard to fix when burned to a DVD (if fixed permanently BEFORE burned).  is the sync REALLY seconds off?  ive had movies that were off by half a second, but never more than a second (except Sherlock Holmes, that progressively got more and more out of sync till it was unwatchable).  a second or more warrants a proper reupload."
,Yamcha67,2010-11-06T23:54Z,"The audio is out of sync like someone mentioned earlier.. only by a second, but I personally wasn't able to watch it.. annoys me.. "
