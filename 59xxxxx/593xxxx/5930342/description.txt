Here's something I'm sure a few people on the internet can enjoy. Lost your Epson driver CD? Epson doesn't provide downloads for the Epson Print CD software that's essential for printing CDs on your printer. This torrent is an ISO of the Epson software CD that came with my Stylus Photo R280.

For:
Windows 2000, XP, XP Pro x64 Edition, Vista
Mac OS X 10.2.8, 10.3.9-10.4.x (PowerPC or Intel)

Includes:
Epson Print CD (1.60A, Vista compatible), ArcSoft PhotoImpression, Epson Web-To-Page, and user's guide.

Combined with the downloadable drivers from the Epson site for your printer, it should work with any Epson printer capable of these functions.
