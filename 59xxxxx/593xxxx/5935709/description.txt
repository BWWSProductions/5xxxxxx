2007 Fairest Floo'er   CD   HEGRICD03 

Fairest Floo'er is the third studio album by Scottish folk musician Karine Polwart, released on December 10, 2007.
Unlike her other solo albums, Fairest Floo'er mostly comprises traditional songs. It also differs from her other albums in its sparse instrumentation; instead of a full band, Karine is backed only by her brother Steven Polwart on guitar, and on two tracks by Kim Edgar on piano. The final song, "Can't Weld a Body", listed as a "preview track" on the tracklisting, is the only original song on the album and was composed for the "Ballad of the Big Ships" episode of BBC Radio's 2006 Radio Ballads series.
