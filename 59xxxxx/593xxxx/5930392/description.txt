It is here only for archival. If you are new to F4UBCD you should search for the
latest version. Due to TPB's current missing "edit" functionality, I can't come back
to edit the latest version into each torrent.

A little preview of what's to come.

Possibly the most powerful 50mb you will ever download. On this disc is a bootable
Windows XP installation containing many useful tools for PC diagnostics and
repair... or anything else you want to use it for. Live XP based on Hiren's XP 10.1
gives you a working copy of Windows on any bootable PC, even without a hard drive.
From there you can edit the PC's registry offline, run an offline Chkdsk, or run a
quick offline temp file cleanup with CleanExternal. All sorts of cool offline stuff
here.

But 50mb gave me a little more room to work with. So I added a few DOS-based
utilities as well, like Spinrite to refresh/repair a hard drive, PTEdit to reveal if
your old system is 48-bit LBA compatible (137gb barrier on old IDE systems), and
Kon-Boot to log in to any local account without a password - and without breaking
the existing one. Pretty powerful stuff.

Suck on that, Damn Small Linux.

How'd this all start? Well, I had created a MiniBootCD of the v2.5 F4UBCD to fit on
an 8cm 185mb CD-R (we had a lot of 'em laying around), and those became the de-facto
shop standard. Then, I was browsing around and I saw a business-card CD-R that held
50mb. Well, 50mb was about the size of the raw XP image. Why not try cramming it in
there? Cram, I did. But in making it fit, I found some extra free space laying
around. And I found that I could apply those techniques to other parts of the system
as well. Next thing I knew, I was thinking of all the useful tools I could cram onto
the disc. Instead of wasting space with flat floppy images, they're now cleared and
GZipped, decompressed on startup with memdisk. And it worked well.

Now you can see what's in store for v2.5 ahead of time. Since this isn't actually
being used officially in shop I can give it to you guys for your consumption.
Hopefully it'll make up for the relatively unpolished v2.0 (by current standards)!

Once you dive into this disc, you'll never need another boot CD. (tm)

Notes:

Compression of the ISO isn't necessary... everything is so tightly packed, 7z'ing it
would only save about 1mb, tops. Better to make it more convenient to use.

The RAM image fills up fast after booting since it doesn't support file compression
like NTFS does. So if you use network support, make sure you do it last, as you'll
be likely to have 0 bytes free after starting it. Clear the *.pnf files from
X:/i386/inf to free some space if needed.
