Only program I have found to reduce noise, though, will try to install again ;)

Thx"
,Sanic7,2011-01-28T19:05Z,"I got no virus detection other then false positive from crack.

My question is Im using it for Ventrilo and for the life of me cant get it to work. When I use duplex I can hear my morphed voice fine but with vent testing my own voice I get my own regular voice. Any suggestions?

(yes I made sure Voice Changer 7.0 Diamond and vent were using the same mic input output device)"

,martykillerman,2011-03-14T18:51Z,"@petabyte1896 i know it is late to help you but your error is simply right click the program and run as administrator instead of just double clicking it
:)
this is with all programs : (0xc0000005) errer => run as admin :)"
,drizeem,2011-03-28T05:30Z,"I know its a silly question but can it do a robot voice? :o)

If that doesn work then try the crack instead."
,xRiViTx,2011-06-24T12:18Z,"Perfect 100% CLEAN Torrent. If you have McAfee, be sure to put your Firewall on Lockdown and to turn off real scanning while downloading and installing so it doesn't automatically remove the so called 'virus'. 

Anyhow, thanks RobbingHood for another fine torrent. I will be seeding for a good while! Cheers!"
,catthou,2011-07-14T23:31Z,"Download speed was good, program itself does what it says, but I have this problem in W7 32bit where whenever the mouse is released on the window, the window hides, and I can't bring it back up. I have to close the program and reopen... only to have it happen again. Thankfully it saves settings between runs, so I can, indeed, change things."
,puma_ile,2011-07-15T13:38Z,"If you have Vista/7 right click Diamond -> Properties -> Compatibility -> Check Run This Program As An Administrator -> Double click to open the program.

@hissil the program works fine if you run it as an administrator, the same thing happened to me too."
,Soulmaster88,2011-07-16T04:44Z,"This crack worked perfectly fine for about 5-7 hours, but after I closed it and re-opened the crack it started making this irritating and continuous static noise and wouldn't stop. Anyone else having this problem, or any idea on how to fix this?"
,ketty_ispageti,2011-07-31T15:26Z,it's eating up my hard drive..how do i prevent this? help :(
,Varcalox,2011-08-09T16:03Z,"Having the same problem as Soulmaster88.

,dirol10,2011-08-28T03:17Z,"Thanks RobbingHood.
For those having noises, switch off the parady mixer."
,dirol10,2011-08-29T00:57Z,"to eliminate echos and noise, use headphones as i did. Hopefully it works with you. Regards"
,tiguhs,2011-09-05T05:43Z,"Everything works perfect! But only one thing is bothering me.. I can't get rid of this annoying echo. After I speak it will filter my voice like it should but a split second after another voice is echoed behind it..

I have tried everything to get it to go away, looked up and down all over the net for a salutation, uninsal, reinstal, just want go away. It's a real pain when you want to use on skype or music and the echo is there. Anyone have my problem and if so know a fix? Thanks in advance."

,Draxcer,2011-11-10T19:45Z,@catthou did u ever find a fix for that? becuase i have the same problem
,hermyt,2012-01-01T02:30Z,"@Draxcer, it seems to be a multiple monitor issue, if you disable all your additional monitors then it doesn't disappear and you can use it normally, once you enable them again it acts up still."
,dirtypantysniffer,2012-01-06T05:39Z,"didn't work for me. all I got was annoying static =[
