"Assassin"

Steven (Boris Kodjoe), Samantha (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) 
and Leo (Carter MacIntyre) get orders from Shaw 
(Gerald McRaney) to take on a mission in Lima, 
Peru where an assassination plot has been 
orchestrated against president-elect Alberto 
Loya (guest star Alex Fernandez, "Commander in 
Chief"). When Samantha gets too emotionally 
invested, she puts the whole mission at stake and 
her own life in danger. Elsewhere, Lizzy (Mekia 
Cox) caters a party for Samantha's college friend 
(guest star Puja Mohindra, "Three Rivers") and 
also discovers a connection with an unlikely 
source.

Enjoy :)
