I can locate 10.6.4  10F2108 on the Apple site but cannot get anything on 10.6.5 10H568.

Could  you please give me a little more information about 10.6.5 10H568 Combo.  
Thanx mate"
,idayv,2010-11-05T01:11Z,"memphist, this is the latest ""beta"" of 1.6.5, that why you don't have it in software update."
,idayv,2010-11-05T01:12Z,"user_01, are you the same user from kexts.com?"

and if you don't know what you're doing with betas, then better don't bother, keep to the ""normal"" updates"
