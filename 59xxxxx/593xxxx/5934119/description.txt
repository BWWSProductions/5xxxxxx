N2KMaster Page Blaster 2.0 Beta Fixed with Extras
-------------------------------------------------

Fixes - Replaced the f'd up files i left out in the first version
Extras - Included Metapad for easy # of proxies seeking, and included 2 proxy harvesters.

What does it do - uses proxies and inet explorer to fully blast your page so that everything is hit on the page not just webalizer, good for making your site look super active when it isn't and ups your alexa rating.

Requirements - Not much is needed, p.o.s. pentium 2 will run it. Tested in XP works fine there. Unknown about Vista and 7

Errors - Only known errors are as followings
1. DO NOT ALLOW IE TO REMEMBER PREVIOUS SESSION, your ie explodes if it does (trust me, i found out the hard way)
2. Doesn't revert your ie proxy setttings to the original setting, you'll have to change it back in internet options under connection, v3 will have this fixed.
