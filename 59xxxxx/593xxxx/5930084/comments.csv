,SURLEWEB,2010-11-09T02:37Z,"This is not high resolution...when you play the movie with VLC the information on the codecs do show 1264 x 528, but it looks like a standard rip. I am disappointed."
,heroin99,2010-12-23T12:25Z,"There is no info about video bitrates used, just the resolution and AR. I am guessing this has like 400-500 kbps video, with 48kbps AAC audio.Of course its low quality, what do you expect from high res encodes with low video bitrates?? There's a reason standard hi res rips have 2000-5000 kbps video. 400 mb 720p rips are no big deal if you use such low video quality."
,fastimer,2010-12-28T22:10Z,Low quality video.
