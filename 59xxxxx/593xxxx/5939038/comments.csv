A choice collection you've assembled here!

I hope you don't mind, but I downloaded ten of your torrents this evening, and they sitting patiently in my queue at this very moment. 
You're a superb seeder, and whoever is giving your torrents all these negative votes is an obvious loser.
Hugs from the Netherlands! :)"
