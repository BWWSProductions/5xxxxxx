Episode

3: THE WESTERN PACIFIC RIM
The third episode focuses on the Asia-Pacific side of The Pacific Rim of Fire, which stands as a living testament to the beauty and danger that powerful geologic forces can deliver. The Pacific Rim is home to half of the world's active volcanoes and ninety percent of the world's earthquakes, yet nearly 800 million people continue to live within its violent edge.

Our journey begins in New Zealand, a land of volcanoes and earthquakes, where we find a 500-kilometre long slip-strike fault deep under the Pacific Ocean. Geologist Hamish Campbell will take us to the crater of White Island, the countryâ€™s most active volcano.  Then we'll visit the country's southern island with John Youngson, to find out how New Zealandâ€™s longest fault-line contributes to the gold industry.

Finally in Japan, viewers will hike up to Mount Fuji â€“ the iconic peak where science and legend converge, getting up-close and personal with a fault-line witnessing firsthand what itâ€™s like to discover new ways of monitoring, and hopefully one day predicting, seismic activity onboard the worldâ€™s most advanced drilling vessels.

About The Series
Geologic Journey II will change the way you look at the world. In each episode, we dive straight into the Earth's mysterious geologic processes â€“ and explore both science and legend as we seek to understand and explain the geologic forces that shape our world, and our lives. With Dr. Nick Eyles of the University of Toronto Scarborough as our guide, this five-part documentary series will reveal the Earth's magnificent power and its breathtaking beauty.

Geologic Journey II takes us to some of our planet's most dangerous and dynamic places, and helps explain how they got that way. From some of the highest mountaintops to the lowest salt plains, and from the center of violent volcanoes to the deep trenches beneath the ocean floor, Geologic Journey II travels with some of the world's most outstanding geologists as they decipher the mysteries of the earth's evolution.

Combining stunning HD pictures and beautiful aerial photography, this series gives the audiences a connection to their surroundings like never before.

Geologic Journey II captures a world being torn apart by the very plates that connect it.
