,createcoms,2010-11-05T09:25Z,Yes it is (thus the x64 tag). 
,createcoms,2010-11-07T04:22Z,I would need someone who's prepared to seed it for a decent period of time as I can't be bothered pushing a 32 bit version for anything beyond a single weekend.
,createcoms,2010-11-08T09:29Z,A minimum of a month.  Preferably more.

,battlecorp,2010-12-07T12:37Z,"Thx, works great!
just got a HP Prolian dl580 g3 server
nice to have a 64 bit version"
,smulx,2010-12-30T23:00Z,This didn't work for me. Ran the keygen as admin but the patch fails. Just says file opening failed.
,Shitdog3,2011-01-04T22:00Z,"smulx , be sure you dont have open ( start ) the Replay Media Catcher , when you try to patch , and put in ( copy ) the keygen.exe in to the location where you have the program Replay Media Catcher install on your computer , and use it from there , hope you understand . Works fine for me , I run Windows 7 Ultimate 64 Bits ( X64 ) ."

Thank you very much dude !!
HereĂÂ´s a little tutorial for the noobs among us:

1. Unzip file
2. Go to setup folder and install ""RCATSetupx64""
3. Copy CRD file to the installation folder and run (not sure whether that is neccessary)
4. Copy keygen to installation folder and run
5. Click on patch and select ""aliccl.dll"" and click open
6. Copy the registration code
7. Run the program (armcp)
8. Click on bottom right of the window to enter the reg key
9. All restrictions have now been removed

Tested and working on Windows 7 x64 
100 % clean software."

,68555,2011-04-05T12:20Z,"Heey guys I have a problem. I installed a newer version of this before, but removed it. Now on installation I always get Installation fail, newer version already installed.
