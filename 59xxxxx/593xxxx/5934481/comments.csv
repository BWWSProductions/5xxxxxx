only 1.8gb for notebooks!"
,Hepburn123,2010-11-05T18:22Z,"Cool, a few questions: will you put out a x64-bit version soon too? When you say ""All updates work with this."" do you also mean KB971033?

You say that this torrent will work with SP1, do you know if that's true also for this other torrent you put up?

Thanks a bunch =)"
,Hepburn123,2010-11-05T18:23Z,Oh and sorry forgot to ask: do you know if KB971033 works with that August 2010 torrent? Suppose if SP1 works that one will have to work too...
[V],thethingy,2010-11-05T21:56Z,"man this is just a rip off from my one, vip's shouldn't do that. "
,Hepburn123,2010-11-05T22:25Z,Thanks for the head's up then!
,Omochao,2010-11-06T00:51Z,"stay away, hes been spamming other windows 7 torrents to come to this one. theres sumin bad on his agenda and i dont like it..."

Why chance it?

Just update and when KB971033 pops up, just hide update.

It would suck to do a full install and then have KB971033, fuck up your install.

If you are just asking for knowledge's sake, has anybody tested this image and seen what happens, if you select KB971033, and do a Windows Update?"

,all-ice,2011-01-24T19:12Z,"okay, maybe i'm just stupid, but i'm not very familiar with this kind of stuff...

I have installed Windows 7 on my pc, and it works fine, but i don't quite understand the instructions about the actiavtion...? o.O
I ran the loader as admin, and chose the first type of activation(the recommended one). When i restarted my computer it asked me to run on either Windows 7 or windows 7 extreme edition or something like that. I didn't know which one to choose so i just picked the 1st one(windows 7) but when i logged on, a message saying: ""activation failed"" popped up...? 

Can anybody help me? how do i activate it properly, and what happens if i don't...?"
