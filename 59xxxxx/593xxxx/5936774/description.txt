We made this from a DVD 9 PAL folder that we obtained on a download.
The download did have French aduio optionally - if there is interest in this
or any iother such idea, kindly just say so, we would be happy to oblige
if there would be support to keep it maintained somehow.

We gave it a full 1500k video bitrate at 720 X 576 - along wioth 192k audio
so you arent going to be missing out here - until an HD comes along I suppose -
although this has very rich color in the picture - this is a movie originally 
made in 1948 after all! (technicolor rendition)


This is a Classic Hollywood movie/play about pseudo "College
intellectuals" who actually do think that having desires for 
senseless murder is a sign of moral superiority

Cheers!
