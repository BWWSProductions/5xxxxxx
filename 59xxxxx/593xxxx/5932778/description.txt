"Chirp"

Claire and Haley have a bit of quality girl 
time while they're stuck at home sick, and 
Phil is preoccupied by the taunts of a 
chirping smoke detector. Gloria and Manny's 
surprise visit at Jay's work leads to 
headaches for Jay, and Cameron gets swept up 
by all the lights and cameras when he goes 
behind Mitchell's back and takes Lily for a 
commercial.

Enjoy :)
