,referhead,2010-11-06T16:59Z,does this one have shit audio like the others?
,Final_Justice,2010-11-06T17:44Z,yup same shit audio
,referhead,2010-11-06T19:34Z,didnt seem all that bad to me. def a lil hollow but other ones were not in sync the whole movie. this one played beginning to end in sync  on windows media player. didnt adjust nothin. its def tolerable. way better than the cam version-obviously
,richardpa,2010-11-06T20:06Z,"ok copy and a steady download...
A/6
V/7.5
Have downloaded 3 versions of this movie, this one, CRYS and CLASSiFiED  and just like what referhead said the audio on this one stays in sync throughout the movie, which the others don't. And the audio seems slightly clearer on this copy too...
Many Thanx to SoftWarez and Feel-Free for the rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"
