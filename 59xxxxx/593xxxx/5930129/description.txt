Although "Right Back Where We Started From" was held off from the top of the Hot 100 for four weeks the single - which received Gold certification for sales of a million on 27 April - did reach #1 on the charts for the two other major US music industry journals Cash Box and Record World. "Right Back Where We Started From' also appeared on Billboard's Adult Contemporary and Black Singles charts at respectively #5 and #46. In 1989, a remake by Sinitta reached #4 in the UK.

It reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart in 1975, and number 3 in the US Pop charts a year later. The song went on to gain lasting notability by being featured in many hit films, such as 1997's "The Full Monty".
   "So You Win Again" is a popular single by Hot Chocolate. Written by Russ Ballard and produced by Mickie Most, it is the band's sole UK number one single, spending three weeks at the top in July 1977. The song just missed the Top 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States, peaking at #31.
   "El Lute" / "Gotta Go Home" is a double A-side single by German band Boney M. It was the lead single off their fourth album "Oceans of Fantasy" (1979) and was the group's eighth and final number 1 single in the German charts. In the UK where "Gotta Go Home" was chosen as the main A-side, the single was their first one since their debut single not to reach the Top 10, peaking at number 12. 
    Osibisa, one of the most important jazz-rock bands ever, was founded in 1969 and made a very interesting fragment of musical history during 70s. Musicians from Ghana join jazz, funk, fusion, caribbean, r&b, latino and african rhythms. This legendary band from Ghana made 20 studio albums; The best known albums are: Osibisa (1971), Woyaya (1971), and African Flight (1981).The band spent much of the 1970s touring the world, playing to large audiences in Japan, Australia, India and Africa . In 1980 Osibisa performed at a special Zimbabwean independence celebration, and in 1983 were filmed onstage at the Marquee Club in London. Many of Osibisaâ€™s works are highly danceable. A fair comparison would be to Earth, Wind, & Fire from the USA only with a â€œworldâ€ flair. Both groups feature highly complicated and sophisticated dance music with Afro-Caribbean bass-drum grooves and dynamic horn charts. (example: Ojah Awake) Both groups could be criticized as â€œinsipid discoâ€ on titles which seek a more commercial appeal. (example:Dance the Body Music, Lets Do It)
