An expose on the Illuminati agent and pedophile, Alfred Kinsey, the useful idiot who carried out the New World Order's "sexual revolution." Documentary examines Kinsey's tests, which employed pedophiles, rapists, murderers, and everything else you can imagine.

Kinsey singlehandedly normalized pedophilia, homosexuality, and promiscuous behaviour in America and eventually the world.

See rare information about Kinsey's ties with the Manson family, Freemasonic scum like Aleister Crowley, and the Church of Satan.

However, the movie fails to address the enormous Jewish role in the sexual social engineering of Christian America and, instead, tries to lay the blame solely on Christian clergy and long-dead Nazis.
