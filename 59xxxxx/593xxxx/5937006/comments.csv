[V],Anacondaz,2010-11-06T03:28Z,"@devil149 read the description m8 its not windows8
but its windows 7 ultimate with some tweaks and features"
,ragman420,2010-11-06T04:56Z,"Some of these tweaks are options in windows, but many are only done with 3rd party software.  I personally don't need it because I've got the 3rd party software (guess where from), but it's a nice package.  Thank the man for sharing. His uploads are clean, useful, and that's what it's all about!"
,rupankur,2010-11-06T06:58Z,Kill3rK--is 2years faster than Microsoft becose Microsoft may relese Win-8 (name  not publish yet) oct2012 as per news.

'It is not even releaed yet by microsoft '

all i have 2 say 2 that is.... this is the piratebay... just cuz somethin isnt released doesnt mean u cant get it.... y do u think black ops has already been on here 4 a lil while"
,Sven the swede,2010-11-06T14:37Z,"RareNinja:

Yes, I agree! Why would Windows 8 not be available on The Pirate Bay just because Microsoft has not made it yet? I will now go and download Half Life 5, suckers! "
,CaptainJacSparrow,2010-11-06T16:34Z,"This is only the x86 version, all that fuckin about for nothin......

Thanks for your efforts but could you be more vigilant with your descriptions, some people would have used their data cap up grabbing this, only to find it's the wrong one."
,MoneyModig,2010-11-06T18:20Z,CRAP and Fake.. This is Win7..
,bonzai37,2010-11-06T19:33Z,Damn there's some dumb mother fuckers on this site! If you can't read the description and understand that this is Win7 with some tweaks then you are a fucking moron that probably can't use the OS you have now. Shut the fuck up and go play video games bitches!
[T],armesht,2010-11-06T22:55Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD

,tonyd79,2010-11-10T18:25Z,i have had this os installed for a few days now and its a very good os the best windows 7 ive ever used thanks again mate good work and ive burned it to disc with no probs
,j2progeny,2010-11-15T10:55Z,"There's ""NOTHING"" special or new here.

i'm sorry but this is just ""PLAIN"" windows7... ""tweaked"".
thanks to the programmer but this is just like Windows XP Black edition for windowsXP.

even Tuneup Utilities can do these tweaks....

i was excited to install this but with this OS.... the system becomes slower compared to the original Windows7...

i would rate this 6/10
will wait for the next OS of windows...

Thanks for the DL anyways...."
,j2progeny,2010-11-15T11:16Z,Very slow Installation of the OS...
,daweedxxx,2010-11-18T14:57Z,this is both 32 bit and 64bit? how do you select 64bit when installing??
,j2progeny,2010-11-18T17:08Z,"@daweedxxx

64bit? 
if you're running in 32bit OS you can't install these on desktop. you need to have a bootable DVD of this to install."
,TaZeRz,2010-11-20T16:29Z,Why would anyone download this weirdo OS?

But Still Was Hoping To Get A Nice Better Version Of Windows 7 Out Of It, You Know Better Look, More Gadgets Ect.. But I Would Say This Is A Complete Fail. Good Effort But There Were No Gadgets Or Any Tweaks Just What It Seemed Different Icons And Wallpapers Hoyed Together In One Package Wich To Be Honesty The Design Of Everything Is Totally Shit!.. And When I Tryed To Re-Install My Original Windows 7 Ultimate Disk.. It Failed.. Message Poping Up In My Computer Saying Somthing Like ""You Cannot Upgrade To This Version Of Windows"".. And ""System Restore Is Completly Blocked Only Had One Date Wich Is When I Installed This.. Even Though I Made A Restore Point Before I Installed This :/.. If I Were You I Would Hold Your Excitment Untill Its Released On Retail Then Download As A Torrent As By This Time Some User Has Ripped The Original, Cracked It, And Uploaded It For Us ;)

,xCrosseyesx,2011-05-09T20:48Z,"@MrExcess: Did you select your Windows 7 disk as your boot drive? It won't work if you're running it FROM this OS. You have to set it as your boot disk and run the install. You might even have to format your hard disk. Yes, you will lose everything that's not backed up, but that's just the risk you take when installing unapproved 3rd party software. Anyone else installing this should be aware of the risks and only bother downloading this if they were going to restore their computer or build a new one and want to try out some of the features.

@Kill3rK: I noticed in the title of this torrent it says x86 AND x64, but the file I downloaded just has *x86.iso. Will both options be there when I boot the disk? Also, what's the activation status? Do I need to run Windows 7 Loader or RemoveWAT? C'mon man, put this stuff in the description!"
