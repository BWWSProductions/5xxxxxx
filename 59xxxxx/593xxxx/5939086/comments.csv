,DandBfan,2012-04-06T11:55Z,"Hey if you like Skrillex you might also like noDj.
No spam intended because seriously this guy is
pretty good. I dunno how I found him but I really
dig his stuff! He's from Los Angeles too and has a similar style to Skrillex but at the same time its differen, Wouldn't waste my time posting this if I didn't think it was worth it, Anyway, Hope you guys can check him out to discover something new.

ALL his music is FREE to download, TOP quality 320kbs too!"
