,AndroidLove,2011-02-11T09:48Z,"@banukaknight:
Dude, Caprio has changed QUITE a lot from his Titanic days. I totally get what you're saying though cos I was also avoiding him like the plague after Titanic - but check him out in Aviator, The departed, revolutionary road, Shutter Island, Blood Diamond, Catch me if you can, Gangs of New York & this film and you will have a VERY different view of this guy. thank god he gave up the stupid romantic persona. Looks like he himself was fed up of the kind of attention he got after titanic and made a conscious decision to change all that. Must watch this! - try to watch on Blu Ray and if possible on a really big screen/projector. Not doing this movie justice watching first time on a small screen!"

I actually bought digital copies of some of these and couldnt get any of them to work on my phone, but all of yours did...much props and thanks a lot for all the work you do. Thanks again! Yours is nearly the only one I download anymore... thanks...or could u email me with a zip file of it if u still have it...i have been trying to get hold of it for years...ml-gregory@hotmail.com...thankx"
