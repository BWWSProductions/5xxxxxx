Dire Straits - Romeo and Juliet [Bananas tv show 1981].VOB 



HQ very rare Bananas tv show promo music video from an outstanding and rare 1980's tv show from Germany, broadcasted from 1981 to 1984, this is practically unknown in America, but this show has very well known artists of the 1980's. 

The rarity of this show is that, all the appearances of very well known guests are a whole new promo music video production that easly could be considered as never seen before videos or second versions of several classic 80's videos.
 
"Romeo and Juliet" is a song by the British rock band Dire Straits, written by singer and lead guitarist Mark Knopfler. It first appeared on the 1980 album Making Movies and was released as a single in 1981. It is rumoured that the song itself has nothing to do with Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, but has been instead inspired by Knopfler's relationship between himself and Holly Vincent, of the band Holly and the Italians. Some of the lyrics indicate that Knopfler thought that she just used their relationship to boost her own career.
