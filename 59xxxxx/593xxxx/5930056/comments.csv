,DragonChaserKev,2011-04-28T06:43Z,"Not much for mpeg-4 format.  My fave viewer VLC plays it all choppy.  Win Media plays it beautifully but I can't get the subtitles to work.  I also have a crappy HP Media Player which plays it great but again I can't get subtitles to work.   

THE MOVIE - quick review

The movie sounds so much better than it is... but is still entertaining enough for it's abstract composition. Really does look like a 1987 movie or later rather than a 1977 movie. That doesn't mean the special effects are very good, some are bad but all in all the movie does work. in what way it works precisely I can't say, it isn't scary, it isn't funny, it isn't a drama or a romance. A twisted fairy tale that does seem to have a huge dose of Evil Dead 2 in it. Just a brighter, bubble gum Japanese super fun time Evil Dead. See I make it sound better than it is. I do think it is worth a second viewing. "
