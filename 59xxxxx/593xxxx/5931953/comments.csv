,PS3Vortex,2011-12-29T22:43Z,"Yes, game is confirmed and working on my PS3 with firmware 3.55 & Multiman Version: 02.09.00. HOW TO MAKE IT WORK?: first completely download this torrent file. Now go and download a program called Winrar. (Winrar extracts rar. files and turns them into media). So you got a file called ""Toy.Story3.EUR.JB.PS3-MRN[PSPPER.COM]"" click into that file and now you see a file called ""mrn-toy3.r00"". Now right click the ""mrn-toy3.r00"" file and ""choose extract files"". Now just choose a location of where you want to save the file and click past all the ok screens and stuff. Wait some time and you will soon have a ps3 game created that you can just transfer to your external hard drive to play on your PS3.(make sure you transfer the game into a folder in your external hard drive called ""GAMES"" if you dont have one, then create one.Hope i helped you all out."
