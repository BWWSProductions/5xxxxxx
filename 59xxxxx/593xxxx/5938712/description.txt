I want to play on EU and US; do I need a second client?

My antivirus software gives an alert for the ... file - wtf?
I'm using the programming language "AutoIt" for the tools, like the client installer or the Content Manager.
This language is also often used for bots, keylogger and such creppy programs.
Because of the familiar compression somefreeware security suites are detecting a virus/trojan in one of the tools.
I can't change that circumstance, so we need to live with that - but I assure you that there is no virus/trojan/... in the files.
