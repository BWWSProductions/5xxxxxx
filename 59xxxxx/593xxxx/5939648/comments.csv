,Ratskin,2010-11-07T14:15Z,Great!  Another incomparable rip from HMV!  Thank you.

You might want to reconsider copy-pasting your comments as your credibility and your comments' importance is waning.

Do you even listen to the music before you reply? 

I'm getting a vague impression you are simply out to badmouth people's efforts. To have opinions and sharing them is fine, but going around leaving the same regurgitated sentence out of spite is not only child-like but depreciates any respect people might have had about you and what you have to say.

A quick look at your portfolio will shed light on your pathetic contributions to the community.

On a different note, thanks for sharing HMV!  "

[T],rjordan21,2010-11-07T22:18Z,"insinuendo, But of course I listen to the music..... that's the whole point.  But when recordings are billed as ""quality vinyl torrents"" and they are far from it I will speak my mind and  offer my experiences of listening to vinyl on good equipment (and by good I don't mean expensive) and......since when is Mr. Marley ""pathetic""?!HMVinyl,  sorry you got so upset/hurt or whatever reaction it was that led you to run elsewhere.  My focus is on the music.  I call 'em like I hear 'em,  Just trying to save people their bandwidth here...."
[T],insinuendo,2010-11-07T22:43Z,"LOL!

The comment was not intended for WHAT you have shared, but rather targeted the meagre collaboration aside your boisterous condescending remarks.

Why don't you go out of your way and impress us with other than your empty claims? 

What have you to put on the table to validate your statements other than premeditated remarks?"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-11-08T02:04Z,XD
[T],rjordan21,2010-11-08T05:43Z,"insinuendo,  I haven't claimed anything at all.....re-read what I've said.....go listen to what I've mentioned (hell, even my torrent)....I've been far from condescending (except for my i-pod crack).....

It's clear I've wasted my time here talking to you both; but let's have an understanding that when Hmvinyl posts inferior sounding music under the guise of ""quality vinyl torrents""  I'm 'gonna express my opinion.....Maybe Hmvinyl will look back one day and say, ""Crap! I spent all that time putting out music from a REALLY SHITTY SOUNDING TURNTABLE""

You, however, can keep re-posting other peoples' torrents and I'll keep seeding the good ones.  Make no mistake, without that, there would be no ""Community""

I'll leave you both with this quote from another ""member"":

""Learn how to listen, that takes training. (""highs that seem steady throughout"" is a good indication that you don't have the slightest clue)
""It's not the ears, it's what's in between that allows for the ability to listen and enjoy""

[V],HMVinyl,2010-11-08T07:26Z,"I'm starting to think that there might be something wrong with YOUR set up... if your sound card isn't configured properly, these files won't sound good. and I in no way have a ""REALLY SHITTY SOUNDING TURNTABLE""

anyway your comments are not appriciated"
[T],rjordan21,2010-11-08T13:24Z,Sound card is fine.....All the other good vinyl rips sound great. 
,Zeppoleon,2010-12-15T06:07Z,"Well... I'm glad I walked into this comment thread...
