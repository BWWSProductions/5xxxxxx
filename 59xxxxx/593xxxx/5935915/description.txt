    A dolphin is about to be born in the treacherous waters    
    of Shark Bay in Western Australia. Puck, the wise         
    mother, must use all her skills to keep her newborn      
    safe from the sharks that sweep into the bay every year   
    With the help of her close knit family of females she      
    must teach the vulnerable baby dolphin the secrets of     
    survival. From whistling to her unborn calf, to the      
    first few hours of baby Samu's life and the struggles     
    her eldest son faces leaving home, this film provides a    
    rare insight into the lives of bottlenose dolphins.
