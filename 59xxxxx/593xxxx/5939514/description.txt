Tea for the Tillerman is an album by singer-songwriter Cat Stevens. This album, Stevens second during 1970, includes many of Stevens most well-known songs including *Where Do the Children Play?,* *Hard Headed Woman,* *Wild World,* *Sad Lisa,* *Into White* and *Father and Son.* Four of the tracks (*Where Do the Children Play?*, *On the Road to Find Out*, *Tea for the Tillerman* and *Miles from Nowhere*) were featured in the Hal Ashby and Colin Higgins black comedy film entitled Harold and Maude, in 1971. The track *But I Might Die Tonight* was featured on another 1971 film: Deep End by Jerzy Skolimowski. Stevens, a former art student, created the artwork featured on the records cover. With *Wild World* as an advance single, this was the album that brought Stevens world-wide fame. The album itself charted into the top 10 in the United States, where he had previously had few listeners.
