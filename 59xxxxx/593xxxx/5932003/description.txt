Our World - Clash Of Faiths (2010)BBCWorld

After the death of Suharto in Indonesia, the country became a secular democratic state. This has fueled the fire of religious conflict in the country, as Islam is becoming the dominant majority. Tensions are rising between the Muslims and other faiths who want to practice in public. The state is starting to step in after 44 people are killed in  riot between Christians and Muslims. We are shown a heated confrontation between a group of local muslim radicals and a group of christians that try and open a Church in the area. The leader of the Islamic group accuses the Christian Priest of "trying to prostitute his religion". The Our World reporters ask the question, why is this happening??? One interviewed Sociologist believes it is because many political, religious and ideological groups were suppressed under Suharto, including the Islamists, and now that they are the dominant force in the region, they are seeking a similar form of control, which is causing the problem of religious sectarian violence to grow at a terrifying rate.
