Comments :
Young bachelor Babee is looking after his dead mother's estate
when married couple Keith and Vera move in. Babee becomes attracted
to them by the beautiful Vera and the risk taking Keith. However at
a party Vera crashes her car, putting Keith into a coma. When Keith
comes out he is in a semi-vegetative state and must rely on Vera to
look after him. Keith can't move or speak but reveals to Babee that
he can still talk and starts to kill those that wronged him with
Babee's help.
