In this episode of Channel 4\'s Dispatches, Peter Oborne investigates evidence and allegations concerning an incredibly disturbing relationship between Rupert Murdoch\'s Cronies at the International News (a tabloid newspaper from the UK), Politicians, and Law Enforcement- specifically regarding instances of \"Cellphone Hacking\". The goons at Murdoch\'s Int\'l News were hacking people\'s cellphones looking for celebrity gossip. They were also busted paying Police Officers for CREATING incidents involving celebrities, that were then used to sell tabloids. When they got busted, every newspaper in the country started to bite their tongues except the Guardian, which continued to investigate the story. Turns out the newspaper and it\'s editors were responsible for Phone Hacking and monitoring around 6000 people...including celebrities, their friends, their friends friends, politicians and public servants....and the police knew about EVERYTHING, even giving them information for monetary compensation. When politicians started to make noise about the issue, they started receiving complaints for the Murdoch Corp. Cronies whom threatened to monitor every aspect and ruin the lives of those politicians who were asking too many questions, essentially scaring off each one out of fear they would suffer electorally as a result of the tabloids \"ruining them\".... This report reveals the terrifying reality of  Manufactured PR events and how they can be used to manipulate public opinion and politicians for those controlling the scheme\'s end. In the end, Dispatches uncovers a small group of \"elite\" people who are highly influential in the new Conservative government as the group behind this scheme...and they seem to be working for Rupert Murdoch....
