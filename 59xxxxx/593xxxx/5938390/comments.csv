,referhead,2010-11-06T17:02Z,hows the quality? 
,leo_grinou,2010-11-06T18:08Z,"Could anyone tell us how's the audio and is it sync ??

Thanks in advance."
,smknjoker,2010-11-06T18:33Z,"Downloading now. Will comment on quality in a bit. 

But I'm sure it's watchable because raymondhome
is great with screeners and cams. 

So I'm just gonna say thank you now, before even looking at the quality."
,smknjoker,2010-11-06T19:12Z,"From what I skipped through so far.

Video: 10 VERY watchable stfu to the ppl who think ten's should only be given to HD, Bluray, or DVD rips.

Audio:7.5 Don't get me wrong you can hear and understand everything it's just a little idk grainy?
To be expected though with most screeners. 

And from what I skimmed through if there is out of sync audio (Didn't notice any) it's not throughout the whole movie and probably not even noticeable.  

Thanks raymondhome! Love your work."

,smknjoker,2010-11-07T02:22Z,I found using the Large Hall setting in VLC's equalizer helped with the audio alot.

,smknjoker,2010-11-07T20:03Z,"It's says in the title: SCR witch translats to DVD Screener not DVD RIP. It is what it is. 


"
,dlarrym1111,2010-11-08T07:26Z,"@smknjoker: FYI, a true SCREENER is a exact copy of the theatrical version put onto DVD by the production studio that made the movie to begin with. A TRUE screener is a DVDrip and NO difference in the quality exists at all.

@smknjoker:PLEASE STOP making comments that a screener is different in quality then RETAIL version as the DVDrip from a retail copy.  AS fore mentioned, THERE IS NOT ANY DIFFERENCE. A screener copy is the one viewed by MOVIE CRITICS, like RICHARD MOLTEN or ROGER SISKEL It is identical in quality and in every other way expect for the hard coded water marking that explains it is a copy that is NOT for Re-Sale, etc, etc, blah blah blah. These types of watermarks don't affect the ""watchability"" because they only ""appear"" 4 or 5 times throughout the movie and last about 30 to 45 seconds each.

ONE OTHER PRACTICE I would like to see stopped as well:

TOO many UP-LOADERS make EQ and video adjustments like and adjusting the +/- picture controls like; the BRIGHTNESS / the HUE / CONTRAST / SATURATION ETC, ETC, ETC. BEFORE they upload it. What an uploader feels is needed as far as picture and audio changes may be changes that when I view or listen to it, may be worse then if it had been left ALNOE. 

CAMS are a bit different and an exception to this above point. It is an exception to the ""DON""T ALTER"" ""SUGGESTED"" Policy.

Not trying RAG on , Just some constructive criticism.  Truely thanks for any and ALL efforts.

The part about video and audio alteration isn't directed at smknjoker in any way. just a comment that I hope all TPB followers and fans can relate to. "
[T],jonnoel1,2010-11-08T14:19Z,"Ok...so everyones entitled to their opinions, right? 

For anyone wondering what the A/V on this looks and sounds like, here it is.....

The aspect ratio is a little too cropped in my opinion. The video is FAR from a 10, looks a little on the grainy side, but definitely watchable. I would describe it as a 7 or so. Between a good TS and a screener. Most of the scr's I've seen out here are DVD quality, and a little better than this one, BUT like I said, its not too bad.

The audio on the other hand is crap. It sounds like it was recorded through a tin can....there's almost no bass, and very grainy and high pitched, but again, still watchable. I would give the audio about a 5...maybe a 6 at best. 

Would I recommend the DL?  Sure...its free, right? If you wanna see the movie, go ahead....If you're picky about the quality, maybe you shouldnt, and just wait for the BRrip in a couple of months.

Thanks to raymondhome for the upload...I will seed it 10x.,

enjoy."

,smknjoker,2010-11-08T22:54Z,"My one and only comment about a screener wow.

True about the cropping.
True about the 10 also. I'm not picky when it comes to free stuff just happy I got to watch it at all."

,hauntnut,2010-11-09T23:02Z,"@ Gangbanker: 

I totally agree. I used to review films and would receive screener copies from time to time, and when the retail version was available in stores I would do a direct comparison. Most screener copies of films in theaters are created in haste, and deliberately left wanting in terms of quality in hopes that it will detract people from making/selling unauthorized copies. The screeners I received were always a single-layer disc, whereas the retail copy would be dual-layer. Also, the audio was more often than not a 2.0 mix instead of 5.1; in one case, I remember receiving one with a mono track! I'm not sure how much has changed in the passing years as far as screener copies go, but based on what I have seen on sites like this, I would imagine not too much has changed. 

Keep up the good work, raymondhome! You're one of the best!"
,Neuro_Belmont,2010-11-10T02:03Z,this is unwatchable quality. don't bother.
,cristiancaga,2010-12-09T01:58Z,"After downloading here's my review:

The movie is watchable, BUT the sounds is like the movie is made in the 60s, It's like watching the  first LG movie in sepia. Anyway like I said its watchable."
