,Sick3r,2010-11-05T22:53Z,Thx.. the show is totally fake but thx.. Its entertaining xD
,BlaTaN,2010-11-07T11:24Z,"Sick3r - If this show was 'apparently' fake (according to u) then why is it, that only about 5-10% of places actually get considered 'haunted' ... if it were fake, (like many other shows out there) why don't we get haunted places every episode, and why on earth would they even bother trying to debunc happenings... 

I'm with miketntgr, if u don't like it, DON'T waste our time with your imbecilic comments.

ava nice day :)"

It's actually, ""Home Is Where the HAUNT Is""

Thank you, come again.  :D"
