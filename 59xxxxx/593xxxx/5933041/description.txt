US Weekly Magazine. 11-15-November 2010.

Us Weekly is the magazine that keeps the closest watch on the ever 
changing and ever exciting entertainment industry, unlike any other
magazine. It takes you backstage at awards shows and sneaks you 
into celebrity parties. Us Weekly peers into the minds 
(and dressing rooms) of the biggest stars, and escorts you around 
the world to see exactly where and with whom the hottest names in 
entertainment have been hanging out. Us gives you more access than 
any other magazine on the newsstand.

Enjoy.
