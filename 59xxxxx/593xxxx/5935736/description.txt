The Killers (1946)

Director: Robert Siodmak 

The Killers is a 1946 American film noir. It is based in part on the short story of the same name by Ernest Hemingway. The film was directed by Robert Siodmak and features Burt Lancaster in his screen debut, as well as Ava Gardner, Edmond O'Brien, and Sam Levene.  An uncredited John Huston co-wrote the screenplay.

In 2008, The Killers was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.

Two hit men, Max and Al (William Conrad and Charles McGraw), arrive at a small-town diner, assigned to find and kill a man, Ole Anderson, aka the Swede, (Burt Lancaster). They track him to a boarding house where, resigned to his fate, he puts up no struggle.

The Swede had life insurance, so Investigator Jim Reardon (Edmond O'Brien) is assigned to look into the murder for his company. Interviewing people from his past, Reardon develops a theory that The Swede's murder stemmed from an unsolved payroll robbery of years earlier masterminded by Big Jim Colfax (Albert Dekker) and involving Kitty Collins (Ava Gardner), a mysterious woman the Swede loved.

Working with a police detective (Sam Levene) who was a boyhood friend of the dead man, Reardon sets a plan in motion to trap the hired killers and the man who hired them.

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
