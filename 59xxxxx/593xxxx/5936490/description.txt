Plot:

Kung Fu Master follows Tan Zong, one of the greatest kung fu experts on the face of the Earth in the midst of what 
looks like feudal China. He's just been offered a new job, as the drillmaster of the Grand Commandant. 
But since Tan Zong is a Buddhist, he's not too interested in making ultrapowerful soldiers, 
so he intends to refuse the Grand Commandant's offer. The Grand Commandant, meanwhile, isn't the type to take no for an answer, 
and as such, he plans a warm welcome for Tan Zong. Thus, in order to refuse the Grand Commandant's offer honorably, 
he'll have to fight his way through a swarm of attackers to reach his goal and defeat a host of villainous kung fu masters to protect his people.
