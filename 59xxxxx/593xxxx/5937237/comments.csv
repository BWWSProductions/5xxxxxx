,dlarrym1111,2011-03-06T05:48Z,"MEGA thanks for your hard work ! These animated ""Future Classics"" are what my new born Nephew (my brother just had his 1st child, a little boy). These animated shows will hopefully be as fun for him to watch, once he's gotten a little older, as the 1960's era Johnny QUEST series was to me.

I don't see to many people offereing thanks, but you and  are great about bringing some of the good animation of the day to the BAY.

Ever hear of a series from the early 70's called ""BATTLE OF THE PLANETS""? It is sometimes incorrectly called ""G-Force"" it is a very early anime cartoon/animation from the Dragon Ball -Z era (not the black and White underground comic of the same name and characters, but of the DBZ era of animated cartoons that went on for several seasons.

IF???? you can find the ""BATTLE OF THE PLANETS"", just post a comment here and direct me to them if you can??"
