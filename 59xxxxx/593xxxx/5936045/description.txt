Hell's Bells 1. Christian documentary about Rock n Roll.

If you don't know what the video is about, read it on amazon.
I'll just describe the torrent.


Pros - 

1. Good quality for small size. The video is 3 hours long, has a full screen resolution and still is only 700MB.


2. Hard to get. This original classic is hard to get. There are very few other torrents and they have bloated size for the same quality.

If you are confused about which torrent to download from, take my word for it this is the best one around.

V - 7
A - 7


Enjoy!!  :-)
