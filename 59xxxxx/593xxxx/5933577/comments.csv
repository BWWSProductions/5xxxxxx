,h3ll4b0y,2010-11-04T11:41Z,what's new in gmod 12
,hunter212yy,2010-11-04T16:11Z,"Well nothing for pirates, some new mp shit"
,Strikefear13,2010-11-04T17:41Z,"It's worth noting that:

A- There IS no Garry's Mod 12.. or 11 for that matter.  Still on 10, just different revisions.  Until the engine changes, it will remain Gmod 10.

And, probably most importantly..

B- You cannot get ANY new add-ons from garrysmod.org or the in-game Toybox unless you verify you own the game through your Steam account.  This means you're limited to nearly jack shit that you can do with the game.

It's $10 guys.. c'mon now."
,Angelo4541,2010-11-24T00:07Z,stfu all of you bitches
,cheeseisedible,2010-12-11T19:01Z,"it's not working for me... I installed the program, all the updates, and all the game packs... it just won't work. If it helps, i have Win 7 Home Premium. Thanks in advance."

,jackoff6969696969,2011-01-26T00:18Z,"Half-Life - Source Content
Access is denied Error
I've tried everything but this one file just dosn't work"
,Derxwna,2011-02-14T03:46Z,"This is directed at Strikefear13:

Your side is very understood, but I bring to you a dilemma. What if you have no present way of obtaining the game through legal methods. Sure, the game only costs $10, but, assuming that we have people under 18 downloading from here (Which is a given), people have parents. Parents are prone to saying ""No."" Sure, they could get jobs, but what if they're too young for jobs, or they have no way of getting there. They could do chores, but what if their parents are like ""We won't pay you for doing chores."" I present to you this dilemma. What does a person do? Do they go without playing the game their friends are all into, or do they cave in and become a pirate and illegally obtain a game.

I fall into this category, and I may be the only one that does. I would personally rather buy the game instead of downloading it, since downloads tend to be a bit problematic and complicated. However, because I lack the income to do so, I resort to the ways of the internet - piracy.

Also, as for downloading extra content, if I remember correctly, one could easily have a friend download it and send you a pack of items. That'd be up to the friend though.

,Macroboy,2011-02-22T13:20Z,"Dude,this better work. I have tried 4 shit torrent but it didnt work. This time,i am reporting you if this is a fake"
,Rihz,2011-03-09T00:03Z,"Hey, i was wondering, how do you add content? (is it possible?) Cuz i have episode 2 and tf2 on steam, and i was wondering if there was a way to add this into gmod. 
(Sorry if there was a way in any of the readme files or if this is obvious, im bad with computers)"
,daraclore,2011-03-09T07:13Z,"I just got this torrent, and after i ran the main installer and the first update I discovered that it had installed nothing but corrupted data. I had to reboot and let the system scan disk clean up the mess. hate to tell ya this HGrailGuy, as I was really wanting this to work, but this torrent sucks ass! "
,Rihz,2011-03-10T03:19Z,"I was able to get this torrent to work, and i finally figured out how to add my own content. Just one more probably-obvious-to-everyone-else question: Is this playable online in any way?"
,Wombaticecream,2011-03-14T22:01Z,"When i open the game, the valve logo screen plays, then stops and shows an error: ""can't find background image 'materials/console/background01_widescreen.vtf'"

Well playied sir!"
,xiIix,2011-04-25T12:33Z,"Derxwna, you fuckin' serious? I'm sorry, but this no money shit doesn't fly with me. I grew up in the projects eating toast for meal replacements and went without hot water and electricity for weeks at a time, and I STILL found a way to make money to go to the amusement park with my friends. I refused to let me lot in life dictate my freedom to have fun. It's called being RESOURCEFUL. There are literally countless things you can do to make money while under age 18. Mow lawns, return cans and bottles, shovel driveways, sell candy at school (I made a KILLING doing that when I was young), join a clan and see if they will all chip in and send you Gmod 10 through steam (My clan did), go to a business and ask the owner if he will pay you $10 to clean up his property. You fucking generation-Y kids these days are such lazy, complaining little shits. You sit there and act like wanting a game and not being able to get it is so horrible. That is not a dilemma, that is a fucking trivial problem that means NOTHING in life.

And to you little posers out there that say ""we are pirates, we don't buy games"". You are not pirates. Real pirates, the people who actually crack, seed and source this shit, BUY ALL THEIR MEDIA, and ENCOURAGE you to do the same! ""If you like it, buy it"", that has been the motto since the beginning! If you don't want to then fine, but as you can see, it comes with limitations. The bottom line is that the scene was here before you were born, and we ALWAYS buy games we like. Piracy isn't just about getting shit for free, it's about freedom of information, freedom of speech and the war against DRM. There is a substantial difference between being a pirate and being a cheap fuck. "
,imjoeyokay,2011-05-01T22:27Z,"@xiIix: nobody really gives a fuck about 'the scene', that sort of elitist bullshit is worthless in this generation.
people come here to pirate games for free, illegally. i find it funny how that needs to be justified in any way."
,SAFIBMWM3,2011-05-04T19:32Z,guys its flipping ÂŁ5.99 
,Dar2652,2011-05-06T23:12Z,"@Everybody who says it's bad to download this:

1: What are YOU doing here in the first place?

2: Piracy is NOT theft. A copy just means there
    are more of something in the world.

3: @xiIix Some people (like me) live in dangerous areas, I am talking 'getting mugged when walking your dog' dangerous. I am not going to shovel some driveway for 10 bucks and lose it on my way home. What's the use?"

,nyepenman,2012-06-01T23:03Z,"@ xiIix: Hey man, people where I live don't hand out money willy nilly, but I do make money through, as you said, being resourceful. But, a question for you. What am I to do should my parents not ""lend"" me their credit card? Garry's mod must be paid WITH a credit card in order to play. I've been gifted some money on steam from my TF2 buddies and managed to get the full version, what now? Time's have changed and it's hard to come by money without A: a job and B: a credit card. This kid was saying the same thing. We PLAN on getting the game, but not just yet, so don't get your tits in a twist when someone pirates a game to get it early."
