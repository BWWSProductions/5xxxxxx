,Teddikilla,2011-02-17T06:44Z,"Well, I'm just gnna say I hate this fucking program cus It's made my pc fuck up many times. If anyone else has problems like I did, with your pc running at about one tenth of it's regular speed. (And then freezing if you try and delete a file u downloaded with this program) go into task manager, stop explorer and then click file. run 'explorer' again. Then, Download Unlocker which lets you delete any file from your pc and delete any fucking file you downloaded with this thing. I thought it was A 1 time glitch, but then I kept using this program and about 10 out of 30 files I got were corrupt -Shrugs- Just me?"
