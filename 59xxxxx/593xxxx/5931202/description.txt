Dianne Alvero (Bea Alonzo) seems to have a happy family. She and her mom, Amanda (Lorna Tolentino), has just renovated their house, her younger siblings are doing great at school, and her boyfriend is already preparing for their future together. But everything in her life shatters when her dad, Franco (Christopher De Leon), returns after ten years of being with his mistress.

More than the presence of Franco, what hurts Dianne the most is her mom wholeheartedly accepts her dad back into their lives, and how her siblings allow him to be their father again. Confused and hurt, Dianne does everything to throw Franco out of their lives. But as she succeeds with her plans, she is shocked to learn that their family's problem is more than the return of this man who has hurt her in the past.
