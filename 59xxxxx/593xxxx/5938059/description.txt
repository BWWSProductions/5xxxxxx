Ant Colony Optimization (from Wikipedia):

In computer science and operations research, the ant colony optimization
algorithm (ACO) is a probabilistic technique for solving computational
problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs.
...
In the real world, ants (initially) wander randomly, and upon finding food
return to their colony while laying down pheromone  trails. If other ants
find such a path, they are likely not to keep travelling at random, but to
instead follow the trail, returning and reinforcing it if they eventually
find food.
...
Ant colony optimization algorithms have been applied to many combinatorial
optimization problems, ranging from quadratic assignment to fold protein or
routing vehicles  and a lot of derived methods have been adapted to dynamic
problems in real variables, stochastic problems, multi-targets and parallel
implementations. It has also been used to produce near-optimal solutions to
the travelling salesman problem.

This is a collection of pdfs including one book on ACO, and a great variety
of papers from scientific journal, on all aspects of ant colony optimization,
and some related topics. The directories in the torrent as shown:

|   |-- books
|   |-- editorials
|   |-- papers
|   |   |-- analysis

`-- related
    |-- biology
    |   `-- economics
    `-- general

Most of the papers are in the directory 'aco' and are on ant colony techniques
and theory. There are some on runtime analysis and theory of ACO. There is a
big collection of papers on the application of ACO to specific real-world 
problems. There are a few papers on hybrid algorithms, on general optimization
techniques, and there are some papers on the biology of real ant colonies.  

We hope you find this torrent useful, please seed it well.

We created this collection because we got emailed a request to find 
materials on ACO, so if you have a request for math-related books or papers,
let us know.
