This is the same torrent previously uploaded, only without the virus. Please stop seeding that virus-infected piece of crap.

I spent a disposable virtual machine on letting the original file extract out of the "virus container" and later hash checked it against another torrent of this same release (that was multi-packed in ZIPs and RARs, how fucking annoying). The included moviecollectorsetup.exe is the same as in the original release.

For more info, read the included NFO. Install, replace EXE, rinse, repeat.
