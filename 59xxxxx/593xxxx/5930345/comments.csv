,ugox,2010-11-03T10:28Z,thanks but this is up to v6.4.1 now. At least that's the version I have. 
[V],FalconFour,2010-11-03T22:53Z,"Yeah, it's just here for archiving, because I had to delete and re-upload all my torrents... also decided to start them all up again and redownload/check for seeds. Amazingly most were still 100% active except for this one, with some 25 leechers and 0 seeds, all 0% completed. So I reconstructed the data from other sources and it matched the torrent, now it's seeded again and everyone's completed :)"
