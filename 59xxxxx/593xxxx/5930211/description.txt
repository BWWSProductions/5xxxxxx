MPEG2 VOB direct from ISO.   Please see torrent files for track listings.   My thanks to the original seeder of the ISO files for Vol 1 to 4 from which this was made.   Note I already have Prince - When Doves Cry in much better quality too I must add in my 80's series where I ripped the originals and had full control of the quality.   Sadly I think Promo Only USA loose the plot when it comes to quality and aspect ratios.    WHEN IS THE MUSIC INDUSTRY GOING TO DROP SUPPORT FOR 4:3 TV's?   Let them watch everything in Letter box format, not the majority who have 16:9 Widescreen LCD TV's sigh.

Few if any of this lot made the charts out side of the USA but worth a look for sure and no serious 1980's Video collection should be without this series.   I am getting a hardware upgrade so only half bandwidth for a wee while so bear with me as I seed these one at a time until all 4 are out.   My load balancing system has broken down and I need to spend serious cash to get my full bandwidth back.

File quality as original (poor in my opinion hence VHS quality) - If I was to write an OLD SKOOL report card on Promo ONLY USA it would say 'could do better and must improve to make the grade next year'!!!!!!  Who the #uck re touched the colour on all these?  Hope you all like RED and PINK.

Mind you NTSC is Never The Same Colour as we all know from years of watching yellow news readers on NBC and ABC in Europe.

Anyway despite all that, I consider this a must have for any serious VJ out there.   Tagged and good to go for import into the DJ software of your choice.   esult of my reduced bandwidth I will be super seeding this and will appear as a peer in the swarm, or you may not even see me at all, but I am seeding to the server in North America and that will then serve you all at the speed of fast (I Hope).   ENJOY
