So what's causing the install fail at the end. I know it's not my computer, im not noob and know my shit. So this release is faulty. Unrarred, installed three times, everytime same result."

Now hit enter.

Step 3. Reboot your computer and now try installing the game again.

After the installation is complete, go ahead and re-enable DEP if it was enabled before. If it was already disabled, don't worry about it unless you want to have it. It is your call.

2. Burn or mount the image that you get once you unrar the files using MagicDisk or whatever you have. Link to MagicDisk http://download.cnet.com/MagicDisc/3000-7970_4-10383679.html

3. Install the game.

4. While games is mounted explore it and find  the Cracked Folder and explore it. Find the BondUpdate_75907_to_76654.exe to update the game.

5. Then copy the contents of the cracked folder and go to Programs Files and find Activision and paste inside the James Bond Folder. Copy over the cracked content and delete the 
original

,jane_says,2010-12-10T15:20Z,"ok, not very clear instructions and there is no crack in my download, but this is how i got it to work.

download the torrent on this page
unrar it and unrar everything you see that is rar
look for the .iso and mount it using magicdisc http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-overview.htm?=mdisc_hlp106

double click on the iso will install the game - this will take a long time and there may be long pauses. just wait.

start the game

click the button ""install update"" (this was easy i didnt have to move any files)

you cannot play yet so quit this.  there is no DVD to insert, it still needs to be cracked.

go here to download crack - its fast http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5931392/James_Bond_007_Blood_Stone_Crack_Only-RELOADED_

unrar this downloaded file.

copy everything from  this crack folder and paste it into the activision>jamesbond folder say yes to replace your ""bond"" executable

double click the executable ""Bond""

set up your account to play, but dont try to set up an online account. 

note- from the torrent on this page i got a ton of rld-jbbs files. i didnt paste them anywhere, they seem useless."

You can't figure out, after you apply the Update, that you copy the ""BOND.EXE"" and ""RLD.DLL"" files from the \CRACK folder (where you found the Update), to the game install folder (i.e. ""C:\Program Files\Activision\James Bond 007(TM) - Blood Stone""), overwriting the installed ""BOND.EXE"" file.

If you can't follow this, pack up your computer and return it to Best Buy. KThxBye."
,universalshade,2011-02-10T11:45Z,niceeeee
,ArchAndroid,2011-02-13T00:35Z,"Okay So. Here goes some simple directions for you folks all wtf and whatever..

1. You take the rar files and you unrar them into the folder of your choice. This will give you a single .iso file.

2. Open the .iso file using Magic ISO or any iso software of your choice. 

3. In the folder you will see Setup.exe. Press it and it will install the game to your system. (There's a weird video that loops during installation and it's quite trippy)

4. Next go to the ISO folder again and find the Crack folder Open that folder and you should see

Bond.EXE
Bond update bla bla bla
rld.dll

5. IMPORTANT: Before you crack the file you must update the game using the bond update (second file) So press that and it will pop up some window and say.. Done! I believe.

6. Go to your direcory. ie Computer/Program Files/Activision etc.. Wherever you installed the actual game to. Once you have updated the original bond.exe, now you can go ahead and crack the file.

7. To crack the file, Take the bond.exe from the Crack folder and place it in the installed game directory and say copy/replace.

8. Also! Take the rld.dll file in the Cracks folder and again copy to the installed game directory.

9. Once you have done this in the order described, you should be able to play the game.

10. If you have black screen, laggy graphics etc, it's not reloaded's fault, your computer graphics card or your single core processor suck and you need to make some upgrades. And this will cost money.

11. Enjoy the game

,wtfronsson,2011-06-07T04:58Z,"anyone else has the laggy graphics? framerate is otherwise excellent, but dips like every second or two. makes the game totally unplayable, because the camera always ends up pointing in wrong direction. i had this exact problem with alpha protocol, and i remember deleting the game because i just couldnt fix it. my specs are well over recommendations."

,Yagami.Light,2012-05-11T18:06Z,"Okay I figured MY problem out,
No sure if this would work for everybody else but it's worth a try right?
I'm Running a W7 64bit Gaming Laptop.
SO my problem was that when I copy the crack and then open it. NOTHING HAPPENS.
And even if I repeatedly open the file it seems like it's just not happening.
So then I tried this other torrent/Other Crack.
and it worked for me.

Anyways Thanks uploader!
And Goodluck for you guys still trying to get this to work! ^___^"
