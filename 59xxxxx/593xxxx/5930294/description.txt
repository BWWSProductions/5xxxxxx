Amazon review:
The single best Christian CD on the Earth
Reviewer: Za'chary Westbrook "Jericho" (Salem, OR)
I'm not a big fan of Christian music, that's because the majority of it is cheap knock-offs of music I don't like in the first place. Andy Hunter is authentic Hard Trance, Trip-Hop, and ambient Trance, he is also praising the Lord at the same time. His music fits in with the likes of Paul Van Dyk, Sander Kleinenberg, BT, and Hybrid. His lyrics are unmistakably Christian, yet perfectly rave.
From 'Go', which is everything Paul Oakenfold wishes he could pull off, with its dark, driving beats, and dancability that fits with the finest of fight-scenes; to 'Angelic' and its Chiller Twist vibe; to the Ivy remixed by BT sound of 'Show'. You can't argue with music this good.

Encoded using dbPowerAmp Music Converter with AccurateRip, using LAME, 128kbps ABR, the way I rip all my music. Will upload FLAC in a moment.
