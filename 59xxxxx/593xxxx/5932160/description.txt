Digital Tutors â€“ â€˜Infiltratorâ€™ Production Pipeline Volume 1 : Concept Design & Storyboarding


In this series of lessons, weâ€™ll focus on the concept design and storyboarding section of the â€˜Infiltratorâ€™ production pipeline.

Weâ€™ll get started by learning how we can quickly generate several rough ideas for our character concept using simple silhouettes. From there, weâ€™ll choose our favorite silhouette and begin drawing the rough line work of our character. Once weâ€™ve finished, weâ€™ll begin refining and cleaning up the line work to prepare it for color. Next, weâ€™ll learn one method of painting color values onto our character and blending them to create the illusion of a 3 dimensional image. Finally, weâ€™ll walk through the storyboarding of a short animated sequence for our character. After completing this course, you will have a good idea of how to create and develop a character for animation. Youâ€™ll also understand how to go about storyboarding out an animated sequence for a character.
