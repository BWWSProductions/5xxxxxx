""Never a disappointment HR, A-class as always. Any chance of either Waterworld, Apollo 13, Backdraft, Maverick, Tremors, All the presidents Men or some classic Robert Redford films. Ive been bugging on.off.on for these with no joy""

Looks like that idiot that cried and whined including to other up-loaders about his requests not being filled paid off.  "
,defeatedsanity,2010-11-05T15:31Z,"I agree that sith lord 24 is a douche bag. That tool must have spammed the same shitty requests about 20+ times to anyone that would listen. on.off.on Please can you upload Vanilla Sky, The Game, The Departed and Boiler Room? If you don't I promise you that I will leave comments on HR's uploads that you are not filling my requests with no joy, hahaha. Your awesome and I'm sure you can't wait for that assclown to return and ask you for Maverick for the 50th time!"

,sith.lord.24,2010-11-05T22:45Z,"deftones69 & defeatedsanity you both are full of shite, yeah i went to HR and OOO because they both know there shit. You slag me off and then in the next sentence request your own faves you want uploading. Double standards or what.....I aint the only one benefiting from these uploads you pair of tools, there great films I'm requesting and you know it. Keep up the great work both HR and OOO"
,cameltoeho,2010-11-06T00:03Z,"I usually never comment but I couldn't resist myself. SITH.LORD.24   You are a fucking moron plain and simple. Making requests is NOT the problem. As the previous posters stated its the fact that you went crying to another uploader and felt the need to mention that he was ignoring your requests. Holyroses does not take requests anyways but once again you needed to mention that ooo was not filling your requests. Why would holyroses care? Go cry to your mommy not to HR. Your requests were probably being ignored anyway because the movies you wanted fucking suck! Waterworld? Maverick? Tremors? Give me a fucking break! Instead of crying to others try being appreciative for what ooo does provide all of us. Do everyone a favor and quit crying, Stop with your lame ass movie requests and go back to masturbating in your mothers basement to your Star Wars trading cards you pathetic fucking loser! "
,jaymian818,2010-12-05T07:12Z,"man, what if the world really did end up that way? It would totally suck cuz u couldnt even burn one...
great up on.off.on, you are a true movie guru, props..."
