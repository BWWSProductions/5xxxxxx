Impossible Journeys: The Traders

This film follows an old Tuareg caravaneer on his last journey across the Sahara desert. Setting off into the magnificent Tnr sand sea with his camels and a worn pair of plastic shoes, 70 year old Al Haji leads his caravan through the labyrinth of dunes using all of the skill and knowledge he has gained in half a century of Saharan travel. By his side is his son-in-law Ilies, the irrepressible life and soul of the caravan and Silliman, an old travelling companion. Together they travel for five months through Niger on an epic journey that will take them over 1700 km across dunes, mountains and Sahel to and from the salt mines of Bilma eventually reaching their final destination - the bustling sub-Saharan markets in neighbouring Nigeria where they sell their precious cargo of salt.
