As she's going down the hall an old man jumps out of a room and says, ""Excuse me ma'am but you were speeding. Can I see your driver's license?"" She digs around in her purse a little, pulls out a candy wrapper, and hands it to him. He looks it over, gives her a warning and sends her on her way.

Up and down the halls she goes again. Again, the same old man jumps out of a room and says, ""Excuse me ma'am but I saw you cross the center line back there."" ""Can I see your registration please?"" She digs around in her purse a little, pulls out a store receipt and hands it to him. He looks it over, gives her another warning and sends her on her way.

She zooms off again up and down the halls weaving all over. As she comes to the old man's room again he jumps out. This time, he's stark naked and has an erection! The old lady in the wheel chair looks up and says, ""Oh no...... not the Breathalyzer again!"" thx 4 the up"

a while back linkin park had the ""Catalyst"" remix contest....

they said they would include the winning track on this album and it would be distributed to all buyers/listeners.

pretty much, linkin park was going to help promote the winner on their new album by including that remix track.

they said it in video blogs and posted it in the prizes area of the rules.

i still havent found 1 copy of this album with the winning remix track included.

i think linkin park LIED to everybody!!!"
