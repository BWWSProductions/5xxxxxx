,DSIN,2010-11-06T14:02Z,Still waitin for ur answer dude... ( iam just curious ) ??
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-07T11:08Z,"@DSIN: I was insulted there six-seven times - and I get the warning (from demonoid staff), not the fuckers, who kept coming every time when TPB was seriously down and I was forced to go demonoid (LOL)...

So, if Morons United throw shit at me, I prefer one direction only. TPB. It is hard anyway, because this site offer no protection to VIP and pink-skull uploaders whatsoever and I am on permanent brink to leave that jazz forever.

Satisfied with answer? (rhetorical question only)"
,DSIN,2010-11-07T19:34Z,"I totally understand man... LOL
