The Ghost Hunters once again turned their spotlights on another lighthouse. This time the TAPS team headed to lovely Newport, Rhode Island and the Rose Island Lighthouse. Located in the Narragansett Bay and visible from the giant, super-scary bridge that takes you into Newport proper the island not only contains the lighthouse but also Fort Hamilton giving the team 2 great locations to investigate.
