,nark0z,2010-12-17T22:23Z,The Nero Multimedia Suite 10.5 Platinum HD key supplied with this torrent doesn't work. It says it's 'Not Licensed'. The key iamutham supplied is for Nero Burning ROM only. Though you could give this key a try: 9X03-014M-337H-H1CZ-L2KK-229X-1ZUX-LPHA
,nark0z,2010-12-17T22:28Z,"Actually, the key I've given is the same as the one that came with this torrent. However, it worked for me after trying it while I had my internet disconnected."
,nark0z,2010-12-17T22:56Z,"What worked for me

1. Run and Install Nero_PlatinumHD-10.5.10900.exe

2. Go to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\ and open the hosts file with Notepad.

3. Add the following to the bottom of the text;
127.0.0.1 nero.com
127.0.0.1 www.nero.com
127.0.0.1 activate.nero.com
127.0.0.1 www.activate.nero.com 
127.0.0.1 activation2.nero.com

4. Save the file. Make sure that you are overwriting the file and not saving it a a seperate file e.g. hosts.txt. Also make sure to make the file read-only afterwards.

5. Windows Key + R, type msconfig and press Enter. Click on the Services tab then uncheck 'Nero Update' and then click OK.

6. Disconnect your internet (recommended but may be optional)

7. Launch Nero StartSmart 10. Enter the key:
KK00-5195-199K-254K-132E-9056-XC07
followed by
9X03-014M-337H-H1CZ-L2KK-229X-1ZUX-LPHA

8. Reconnect internet if you had disconnected it and the Nero products should work."

,dr_mike,2011-01-08T10:12Z,"Step 3: IP address 127.0.0.1 is localhost, that is your own computer. So the idea is to send all the ""Nero-traffic"" to the user's computer instead of NERO servers.
Step 5th Prevent ""NERO update"" to start when you start Windows.

Pretty clever stuff."
,sint75,2011-01-09T06:53Z,any one have a patent serial for this version??

I have a problem with this step. Im trying to overwrite it but it says that i need Administrator permission, but i am the administrator user and the only user on the computer? After that it says Access Denied and i can't go any further. What do i do?

I tried then to skip this step to 6 and 7 and im inputing both codes but the products don't work. Im guessing this is because i wasn't able to complete step 3?"
,nark0z,2011-01-10T14:17Z,"@mat459: In short, Nero can be a pain in the ass to activate :(

@iamutham: Your key does seems to work for me

@DonCorleone7 Make sure the file is not set to 'Read-only'. To do this, right-click the hosts file > Select 'Properties' > Make sure that 'Read-only' is unchecked.

Now try adding the following code into the bottom of the file via Notepad. 

IMPORTANT: When you have saved the file and closed Notepad, make sure to put 'Read-only' back on. Otherwise, I don't think it will work.

Feel free to leave a comment on how you go :)"
