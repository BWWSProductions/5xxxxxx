One of those albums where the tracks are complex, multi-layered, and fresh. With fresh, you get hit and miss, but the few hits end up being something worth stashing in the permanently library. "ANTHEM RAVE" and "Dragunova" are clearly the hits, "Another Mind" is pretty good I guess. If you're looking for something out of the ordinary, give it a shot.

Pretty cool album cover too.
