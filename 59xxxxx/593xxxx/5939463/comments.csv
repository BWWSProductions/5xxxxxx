,jacob38g,2010-12-06T23:50Z,Thats on your end. You need to download uTorrent before you download anything from here. (Referring to this person: SquisheeLOTUW)
,xerotrinity,2010-12-09T02:52Z,no its not just his end.  Its definitely the uploaders end
,jacob38g,2010-12-09T04:38Z,"Yea sorry, i realized that just after i posted the comment. I should have tested it myself. Sorry =]"
,psut,2010-12-31T02:29Z,"1) uTorrent isn't the solution to every problem on here.  He would've gotten that error no matter what the torrent client he was using. That aside - I use uTorrent myself and love it.  But getting a new torrent client isn't the answer to everything.
2) This seems to work fine when using the magnet link."
,exoditedragonlord,2011-01-02T10:26Z,"I get a 404 when I click on teh download link and when using teh mirror, the file has no contents or size. Never had this problem with a torrent before. Any ideas?

Can't find this one anywhere but here!"

,jcsmamacita,2011-01-07T18:51Z,This obviously isn't working. Any body else know where we can find the soundtrack?
,InsidiusX,2011-01-10T17:08Z,Hey all it worked for me using uTorrent. Listening to it right now.
,court07,2011-01-10T18:01Z,"***LISTEN***      the torrent file obviously isn't uploaded properly, if you're using uTorrent, then use the Magnet Link next to the download link.            It'll show as no files at first but that's because magnet links don't contain the info straight away give it a minute it'll know what files to get.     It's working fine just get used to using magnet links ;)"
,ImperialDragon,2011-01-18T14:35Z,"The quality seems pretty low.
Sounds like...crap.
I appreciate the upload but it's not pleasant to listen to."
