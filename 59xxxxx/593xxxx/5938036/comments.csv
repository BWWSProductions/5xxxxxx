,moo2u,2010-11-22T00:07Z,Thank you very much! So glad someone finally torrented this release.
,guitarlesson,2010-12-20T08:02Z,"These are amazing. Finally no PAL Speedup ruining the audio, and the x264 encode is almost imperceptible.

One Question though. What does JCH stand for?"
,guitarlesson,2010-12-23T04:33Z,"FYI... Episodes 2-19 are actually episodes 3-20, for those who care. Episode 1 is 2 hours long and was originally aired as episodes #1 and #2. If you use MediaBrowser or anything that fetches metadata from the internet, you'll need to change the names."
,avalonbss,2011-01-05T08:04Z,No this is the real name for NTSC version for USA ;)

Keep it up."
