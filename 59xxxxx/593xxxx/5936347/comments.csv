,notforlonger,2010-11-05T22:04Z,thank you~~
,JIHUIN,2010-11-09T09:49Z,"Domo arigato....Salamat po...Spasibo...Thank you...or in any other languages :) Great game...

Maybe others are wondering every time I leave a comment  I always say it works on 5.03 GEN-C, 5.50 GEN-B, & 5.50 GEN-D3....Well, the reason is that my son's and their cousins have different system version & model of PSP. So every time I downloaded games, I always try and test the game in these 3 different CFW.

And NitrogenUA is one the most trusted and reliable uploader of PSP game here in TPB that works perfectly on the 3 said CFW.

Have a nice day NitrogenUA and God bless....peace."
,JIHUIN,2010-11-09T10:41Z,"By the NitrogenUA, do you have Final Fantasy VII : The Advent Children?"
,NitrogenUA,2010-11-09T16:41Z,"Thanks for your feedback, mate. Thanks for the appreciation.

P.S.: Yes i do have it. Why asking?"
,JIHUIN,2010-11-10T01:52Z,Can you please make an upload of Final Fantasy VII: The Advent Children (PSP)...I already search the TPB and there is no active torrent for this game.
,JIHUIN,2010-11-10T02:14Z,Sorry mate...my mistake...Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is movie only. There is no PSP game for this one....just ignore my previous comment...my apologies to bother you...peace

,josh1003,2010-11-16T13:35Z,Great game. But there is one problem. my psp works on gen d3 and hangs on chapter 6 of the story. anyone else got this prob?
,destinyfate1,2010-11-18T12:41Z,i have freezing issues when i try to load my savefile. i tried to start a new game all over and i am still unable to load...any solutions? (the screen shows NOW LOADING and the music plays but it's just stuck there)
,Tekniqe,2011-01-04T07:15Z,"1000, 5.50 GEN-D3

System shuts off on boot.
Probably user error as NUA ups have ALWAYS been solid for me. Too lazy to figure it out as UMD works just fine in my non-cfw slim =)

I'll post a troubleshoot if I get sick of having to UMD it.

Thx for your ups, NUA! Cheers =)"
,Herz_F,2011-01-04T15:20Z,"Sorry to bother you, but can anyone upload the fixed version of this game, for 5.00M33-6? I do not like the ""GEN"" firmware, because they have a problem with PSX games (I hear) and it's only a game, which is a fixed version can not be found.
