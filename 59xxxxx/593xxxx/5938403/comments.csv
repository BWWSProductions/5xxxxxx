Audio/Video 7/10"
,Nickyboy7,2010-11-06T14:00Z,"Quality might actually be 8/10, it's pretty good."
,DoodleBop,2010-11-06T15:39Z,"Thanks for the effort mate. But its been fucking hard to get GA in good quality since season 4 started, where are all the uploaders ? :s"
,Nickyboy7,2010-11-06T16:35Z,"I don't know. I had no trouble with the first three seasons. I have them all in good quality. But season four is a different story. It's strange as some weeks you get a great upload which goes up from people like Puma, then other weeks it's like you are lucky to get a poor quality version.  And they are being uploaded in different formats too. Where as the first three seasons were very consistent in format and quality. If I got this series where I live I would upload it every week, but I don't. If I don't see a episode a couple days after it airs, I go looking for a web rip to upload so people can watch. It's better than nothing."
,Zebubulle,2010-11-06T17:23Z,"Yes it is, so thank you!"
,ToneZone,2010-11-06T19:30Z,"@Nickyboy7
Thanks for the up!
I wonder why TvTeam and Puma haven't upped any GA lately.  I'd MUCH rather watch these instead of on TV with the commercials."
,Nickyboy7,2010-11-06T20:01Z,"I have no idea really. I have a wild guess that whoever used to upload the first three series has started only uploading Ghost Adventures to their Youtube channel exclusively now. Which is why we're left with so many web rips.

Could be wrong of course. But it's very hard to get a episode of season 4 that comes close to the quality that was being uploaded with the previous series. It's all very strange. :/"
,muslix,2010-11-06T22:55Z,The effort is really appreciated. Watching something is better than nothing. Thanks!
[T],trialNerror,2010-11-09T13:19Z,"I've been trying to upload the Ghost Adventures / Hunters / Lab shows, as well as Destination Truth series this season.  
It's not actually my own ripped file, but there is a nice TVRip here -> http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5940004/Ghost_Adventures_-_S04E08_-_USS_Hornet.avi"
