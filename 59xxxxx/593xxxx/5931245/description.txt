The Boys Light Up is the debut album from Australian surf rock band Australian Crawl[1] which was released in 1980 and contains the title track, \"The Boys Light Up\", \"Indisposed\", \"Downhearted\" and their previously released debut single \"Beautiful People\". The album reached #4 on the Australian album charts and remained in the charts for an unbroken 101 weeks,[2] eventually selling over 280 000 copies (five times platinum).

The title track, written by lead singer James Reyne contains the invented word \"dorseted\":

    \"People aren\'t used to hearing \'Dorseted\', and it\'s not actually a word - it\'s from the Dorset Gardens - I\'m trying to be as suburban as possible, and it rhymed with \'corseted\'.\" - James Reyne, 2003[3]

Various band members were involved in songwriting, often with relatives or former bandmates. Rhythm guitarist Brad Robinson\'s father James Robinson was a Federal Arbitration Court Justice and co-wrote two songs for this album.[4] Reyne\'s bandmate from Spiff Rouch, Mark Hudson co-wrote their first single, \"Beautiful People\" (1979).[5] \"Downhearted\" was written by Bill McDonough and his bandmates from The Flatheads, Guy McDonough (his brother, who later joined the Crawl) and Sean Higgins.[5] Producer, David Briggs (Little River Band guitarist), co-wrote \"Hoochie Gucci Fiorucci Mama\" with Reyne.[5]

The album was re-released in 1992 in CD format (see cover right below), and as a 2-CD set with follow-up album Sirocco in 1996.
