,MLSS,2011-01-26T18:49Z,"game does not work for me.
I've finished downloading and installing this. I have also installed directx. when I try to start the game I get: ""cannot run this game: failed to set up graphics system""

what can I do to fix this?"
,bolton1,2011-01-27T21:43Z,"to all those complaining about d3dx9_41, first you must go to the directx folder included in the games main folder (sports interactive). find the d3dx9_41x86.cab file and extract it (I use IZArc but Winrar might work) to the main folder (sports interactive), and you're done! Enjoy P.s. It wouldn't let me extract it directly to the sports interactive folder, so i extracted the files to my desktop and cut them to the sports interactive folder."
,bolton1,2011-01-27T21:45Z,"forgot to say, by main folder i mean the Football Manager 2011 folder inside sports interactive :)"
