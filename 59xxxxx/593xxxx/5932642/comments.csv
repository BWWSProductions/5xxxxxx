,xeroxz,2010-11-14T10:24Z,"Thought I'd make it clear that this is a DVDScreener, and not a DVDRip."
,Andy-Camel,2010-11-18T18:35Z,They are now. Tilhas tizeh Samir. 
,SKYNET-T14,2010-11-30T23:47Z,am having doubts is it DVDrip ? V:10 ?
[T],samir_ar,2010-12-03T11:23Z,"xeroxz ... yes it s a dvdscreener and not a dvrip ... I am putting up those torrents for the multitude of persons, like Andy-Camel the camel jockey, who are incapable of attaching subs to movies so they can enjoy ... sometimes i wonder if it worth the effort..."
[T],samir_ar,2010-12-03T11:56Z,"SKYNET - T14 ... rightly so ... your doubts are in place ... it is a dvdscreener and not a dvdrip ... i apologize for th erroneous description ... As for quality,  ... I will let others make that judgment,  mine may be slightly biased ...."
[T],samir_ar,2010-12-03T12:23Z,"Andy-Camel ... i think I would rather rather try to kiss something other than your a$$ which has been worn out on some camel hump ....

By the way, you really should try and improve on your spelling of ""tizeh"" ... it is my turn now totell u tilhas tizi andy-camel"
