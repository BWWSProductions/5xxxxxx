I am using M3Dsreal :S M3i Forum ? ok will check out"
,kreem,2010-11-06T16:28Z,"@simmyboy80

Just to eliminate it - I went to the site you mentioned and downloaded the latest core (1.6.1) and the 4.F software and the game does work - but it runs incredibly slowly.  The game runs normally on my R4i but locks up randomly.  I guess it's another case of the original old carts work and the new crappy clones dont."

if you have m3ds real you can use sakura firmware with woodsm3 and most titles will work , see m3i forum for details"

just extract file downloaded to an empy folder and then copy all folders to sd card making sure you delete old system folders on sd card then put back into cart and turn on ds"
