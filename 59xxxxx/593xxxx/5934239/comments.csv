,jogden139,2010-11-05T21:05Z,Is there anyway to remove the subtitles? :S
,OrpheusDude,2010-11-09T09:07Z,"HARD CODED DUTCH SUBTITLES - NO WAY TO REMOVE THEM.  Better to download a Sony screener for now and wait for the official DVD to come out if you want a DVDR rip.

Oh yeah - really awesome movie!"
