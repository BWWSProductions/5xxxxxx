    The Hairy Bikers search for Britain's best family of       
    cooks. Over eight weeks, 40 families compete in a         
    series of culinary battles resulting in just one winner. 
                                                              
    The Bikers are joined by actress Fay Ripley, who bakes     
    a lemon drizzle cake, and the Bikers serve up their       
    dish of the day, pork tenderloin wrapped in pastry.
