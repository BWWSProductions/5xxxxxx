He made his debut in 1966 with the hit single \"Tell It Like It Is\", a Number One hit on the Billboard R&B charts. Neville did not chart again, however, until 1989, when he collaborated with Linda Ronstadt on three consecutive duets: \"Don\'t Know Much\", \"All My Life\", and \"When Something Is Wrong with My Baby\", the first two reached Number One on the Adult Contemporary charts. Neville has released more than 20 singles, including three Number Ones on the Adult Contemporary format, and a fourth on the R&B format.

Career

Aaron Neville has had a career as a solo artist and as one of The Neville Brothers. Of mixed African American and Native American heritage, his music also features Cajun and Creole influences.

Neville first came to public recognition with \"Tell It Like It Is\" which topped Billboard\'s R&B chart for five weeks in 1967. It also reached #2 on the Hot 100. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.[1] A remake of the song was a Top 10 Pop hit for the Rock group Heart featuring Ann and Nancy Wilson in 1981.

In 1989 Neville teamed up with Linda Ronstadt on the album Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind. Among the duets recorded for the disc were the #1 Grammy-winning hits \"Don\'t Know Much\" and \"All My Life\". \"Don\'t Know Much\" was certified Gold while the album was certified Triple Platinum for US sales of more than 3 million.

His other hits have included \"Everybody Plays the Fool\", his successful 1991 cover of the 1972 Main Ingredient song, that reached #8 on the Hot 100; \"Don\'t Take Away My Heaven\", \"Hercules\" and \"Can\'t Stop My Heart From Loving You (The Rain Song).\" Neville\'s biggest solo successes have been on the Adult Contemporary chart, where \"Don\'t Know Much,\" \"All My Life,\" and \"Everybody Plays the Fool\" all reached Number One.

In August 2005 his home in Eastern New Orleans was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina; he evacuated to Memphis, Tennessee before the hurricane hit. He moved to Nashville after the storm.[2] and had yet to return to the city as of early 2008, causing the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival to temporarily change its tradition of having the Neville Brothers close the festival. However, the Neville Brothers, including Aaron, returned for the 2008 Jazzfest, which returned to its traditional seven-day format for the first time since Katrina.[2] Neville is in the process of moving back to the New Orleans area, namely the North Shore city of Covington.[2] Neville performed Randy Newman\'s \"Louisiana 1927\" during NBC\'s A Concert for Hurricane Relief on September 2, 2005.

Aaron signed to SonyBMG\'s new Burgundy Records label in late 2005 and recorded an album of songs by Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield, Sam Cooke and others for Bring It on HomeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦The Soul Classics, released on September 19, 2006. The album, produced by Stewart Levine, features collaborations between Neville and Chaka Khan, Mavis Staples, Chris Botti, David Sanborn, Art Neville, and others. The album\'s first single was a remake of The Impressions\' 1963 classic \"It\'s All Right.\"

He also sang a new version of \"Cotton,\" for Cotton, Inc. which was introduced during the 1992 Summer Olympics. In 1988 he recorded \"Mickey Mouse March\" for Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films, one of Various Artists. In 2006, Neville sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", alongside Queen Of Soul Aretha Franklin and Dr. John on keyboard at Super Bowl XL in Detroit, Michigan.

On October 27, 2006, Neville made a guest appearance on an episode of the soap opera The Young and the Restless.[3] He sang \"Stand By Me\" and \"Ain\'t No Sunshine\", from his album, Bring It on Home Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ The Soul Classics. In 2008 he released Gold, which includes a double album of his hits.

Neville\'s oldest son Ivan is also a musician and released an album, If My Ancestors Could See Me Now, in 1988, which yielded a Top 40 hit with \"Not Just Another Girl.\" Ivan has also performed with The Rolling Stones and Bonnie Raitt, and played bass for Keith Richards on his first solo tour. Ivan then assembled his own band (Ivan Neville\'s Dumpstphunk) which tours and frequently appears in New Orleans.

Neville\'s third son, Jason, is a vocalist and rap artist who has performed with his father and with the Neville Brothers, notably at the 2009 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.

Neville is an inductee of the Delta Music Museum Hall of Fame in Ferriday, Louisiana.
