                    HDDlife Pro 3.1.170 (Multilanguage) + Crack



Released date: June, 8 2010


HDDlife is a software that helps you protect your HDD.

HDDlife Pro 3.1.170 - a great program that will allow you to monitor the physical 
condition of your hard drive in an accessible and understandable form. When you 
start the program displays a list of your disks with the percentage of "health" 
remained, and their temperature. HDDlife can work in a preventative mode, 
regularly monitoring the "health" of hard drives and informing you of the 
results of the audits. Warned about a possible hard drive failure, you will 
protect yourself from data loss.

HDDlife - worried about hard-drive failure? Get HDDLife - a real time hard drive 
monitoring utility with alerts, malfunction protection and data loss prevention 
functions. This hard-drive inspector is an advanced proactive hard drive failure 
detection system that controls 100 of hard-drive risks.


Features:
*********
Warning control. 
The regular and constant use of HDDlife will allow you to learn about possible 
hard drive failure beforehand and to prevent the loss of personal data.

Preventative regular inspection. 
HDDlife can work in the background, checking and controlling the health of your 
hard drives and security of your data at regular intervals. It uses as little 
memory and does not bother you with unnecessary messages.

Information on the free disk space. 
Full details on all sections of the hard drives - the name, file system, total 
size, free (available) space.

Thermometer for your zhectkih drive. 
With increasing temperature, the hard drive of only 10 Â° C, its performance drops 
by almost 2 times! HDDlife allows you to solve this problem - the actual disk 
temperature is always displayed in the system tray (near the clock).

Time management works - how old is your hard drive?. 
There are times when you need to know how the old hard drive is and how much time 
it actually worked? HDDlife gives you this opportunity! Now reflect the time spent 
in disk form years, months, days and hours!

Office of noise / performance disk. 
With HDDlife, you can manually set the volume level of the disc. At the same time 
in quiet mode decreases performance, but as the tests, in the quiet mode, it drops 
by only 10-15%. But for some disks (eg, Maxtor) you can achieve almost silent 
operation!

Remote monitoring and alarm systems. 
HDDlife allows you to control the pre-crash consisting of disk and the replacement 
of the hard drive before it fails. Network administrators can configure alerts 
about dangerous state of hard disks. Messages may be sent via a computer network 
(analog net send ...) or by e-mail, making the remote control for any amount.

HDDLife is S.M.A.R.T. technology based and works both for single PCs and large 
computer networks. S.M.A.R.T. technology was developed by hard-drive manufacturers
to accurately predict hard-drive life span and prevent HDD malfunction.


Benefits:
*********
HDDLife displays S.M.A.R.T. attributes real time and alerts system administrator 
if particular hard-drive's attributes exceed threshold values and being at risk.

The system administrator can then back data up and/or replace endangered hard-
drive. HDDLife loads on Windows start, compares new attribute values with the 
previous values and consumes absolutely no memory.

The program is extremely straightforward no fundamental knowledge or PC or hard-
drive technology needed whatsoever. Zero failures during last four years for 
100000+ hard-drives monitored!

JustNow! is a completely new technology that allows you to find out the state of 
health and performance rate of your hard drives immediately both when you start 
the program for the first time and when you start it again!

There is no need to control disks over a long period of time! No analogous 
software allows it! Thanks to this technology, HDDlife also shows the health 
and performance level in percentage as compared to a new disk.

HDDlife can work in the background mode checking and controlling the health 
of your hard drives and the safety of your data at certain time intervals. 
At the same time, it uses as little memory as possible and does not annoy 
you with unnecessary messages.

To be able to work efficiently, you must know not only the health, but also 
the performance rate of your hard drive. With HDDlife, you will be able to 
see when it approaches the critical level and have time to replace your 
hard drive before it becomes too slow and paralyzes your work.

Modern computers emit a large amount of heat and use coolers to get rid of it. 
A hard drive is no exception: the faster it works, the hotter it gets. When the 
temperature of a hard drive increases by 10% its performance rate gets two times 
less! That is why it is very important to control their temperature too. HDDlife 
allows you to solve this problem as well since the actual disk temperature is 
always displayed in the system tray (next to the computer clock).

Another nice feature is that HDDlife can show you the highest temperature the 
disk has reached for the entire period of its work (in case the disk supports 
this feature). It will allow you to determine how the disk has been working so 
far, whether it has ever been overheated before and whether it will have failures 
in the future.

*** When using TPB please read these important notes: 
*****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

This torrent is scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security 
2- Avira AntiVir Premium 
3- avast! Pro Antivirus
4- Kaspersky Antivirus

Also scanned with some well known antispyware, and tested in Sandboxie.
Malware detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
