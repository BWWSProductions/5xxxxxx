2003 Upstate Songs    CD  TAR007

 Included in Rolling Stonesâ€™ Critics Top 30 Albums of 2003 - "Upstate Songs is perhaps the sweetest and most honest folk pop album recorded this year. Sproule's vocal and lyrical beauty is unmatched." 

Upstate Songs is gentle, poetic, classy, and achingly gorgeous posessing a floating atmosphere exploring the subtle dynamics of two acoustic guitars, played skillfully by Sproule and co-producer Paul Curreri.
  
â€œUpstate Songs is so honest, so well-crafted, and so effortlessly played that the album exudes timelessness.â€ All Music Guide  4 Â½ Stars 2003

 â€œDevon Sproules new take on timeless music is a breath of fresh air â€“ making her the first US artist weâ€™ve wanted to put on our cover this century.â€ fRoots UK 2007
