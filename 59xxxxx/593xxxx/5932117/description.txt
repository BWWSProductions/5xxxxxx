Fed up with his boyfriend, a young man has a brief encounter with a woman he meets on the beach in this short from director FranÃƒÂ§ois Ozon. A Summer Dress opens with the straitlaced FrÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ric (FrÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ric Mangenot) criticizing the more flamboyant SÃƒÂ©bastien (SÃƒÂ©bastien Charles) for incessantly prancing around their cabin while blasting his favorite \'60s pop singer, Sheila. FrÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ric bikes to the beach to escape and meets an older woman named Lucia (Lucia Sanchez) who, without much conversation, leads him to a secluded spot where they have sex. FrÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ric notices an onlooker during their lovemaking; when he returns to the beach, his clothes have been stolen. With no choice but to wear Lucia\'s spare dress, SÃƒÂ©bastien prepares himself for an odd confrontation with FrÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ric.
