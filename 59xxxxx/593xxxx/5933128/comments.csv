just downloaded this movie. the sample is in avi so i can watch it..but idk what format the rest are. in the folder it downloads to, each file looks like a piece of paper (i'm new to downloading, so)..

They say: 

""rx-santapaws.r00"" 
""rx-santapaws.r01""
""rx-santapaws.r02""

 etc..and goes up to ""rx-santapaws.r47""

how do I make these into video files to watch? idk what to do.."
