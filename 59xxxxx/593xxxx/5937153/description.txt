One of the very few Vocaloid albums I enjoy, entirely Miku, most of the tracks are well-developed and unusual/fresh. The album is fairly chill, downtempo and some ambient trance are mixed in there. Being Vocaloid, of course, there are Japanese lyrics, so this isn't primarily instrumental like most electronic music. Nonetheless, Miku's voice isn't butchered like many Vocaloid albums, and sounds pretty well constructed. All of the tracks on the album have some merit, and my two favorites are Borderline, a rather dark trance track, and Fly High, an upbeat and pretty-sounding track.
