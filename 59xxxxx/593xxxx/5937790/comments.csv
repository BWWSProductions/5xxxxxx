,Eluisa,2010-12-06T03:55Z,"Just as slippry said, this file is corrupted. When you select a new case in game it reboots your Wii. I tested this on 3 different Wii's and 2 different loaders. It's ""bunk"" don't bother downloading it."

Google is your friend!"
,drewkrew,2011-01-21T21:34Z,"Hmmm...
I'm inclined to agree with the idea that this is corrupted, a bad dump, or damaged by over-scrubbing, as it also went wrong for me using so many different methods of loading and configurations.
Game loads, displays opening credits, proceeds to main title menu, and as soon as you select ""NEW CASE: Case 1"" it immediately crashes the wii.
The comment on updating cIOS files makes no difference i found...

,drewkrew,2011-01-22T23:35Z,"Right, i have looked into this...
THIS GAME WILL NOT RUN THROUGH A USB LOADER as it tries to reload IOS, which USB loaders can't do as the USB ports temporarily reset when the reload IOS command is sent and therefore drop the connection to the USB drive.
THIS SHOULD LOAD FROM DISC THO.

Which brings me to the main point here... 
WHY SUPPLY THIS GAME AS A "".WBFS"" file? 
WBFS files are for USB Loader use. This should have stayed as an "".iso"" disc image!"
,joe_83,2011-01-23T16:30Z,"@drewkrew
Would you rather take 5 minutes to convert to .iso or take a few extra hours and bandwidth to download the extra 3+ GB?"
,ra_H,2011-01-24T22:21Z,Ok. I used wii backup manager to convert to iso and burn the image on to a disc. Now will this work or will my wii crash.
,ftomi,2011-07-21T20:28Z,works fine with d2x and configurable usb loader and wiiflow
