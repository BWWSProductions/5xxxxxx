,pp_11,2011-06-13T22:23Z,"i downloaded and played one song on CD 1: 01 - Beethoven Piano Trio Op.97 'Archduke'- 1. Allegro moderato.flac. This piece hisses for the whole song. Is this hiss from the original recording or is it just a bad flac? Thanks. 

N.B to others. Download it with unlimited on and it'll download faster. That's what i'm doing getting: download of 288kb/s upload of 105kb/s at the moment."
,pp_11,2011-06-15T20:39Z,Edit: hissing seems to have stopped by itself for some reason....very strange. Great quality. Ty Apokarteron!
,pp_11,2011-06-15T20:41Z,"oops that was another song...song 1, CD 1 still hisses.....others that have downloaded so far seem fine :). Still great for nothing ;). OP if you get a sec could u have a look at song 1 cd 1 plz? It's bugging me a bit, A million thanks :)"
,pp_11,2011-07-08T22:50Z,lot of the pieces hiss. It's very annoying. ty for the upload but hissing pieces are useless. 
,pp_11,2011-07-09T12:56Z,I recommend not downloading this because of it's poor quality. Where I applaud Apo's efforts this is of poor quality not fit for Beethoven. Of all the pieces i've listened to over a half has hissed or crackled. I'm not an audiophile but these are bad! Downloading symphonies from another seed now - might bin this entirely. :/
,arnshead,2011-07-29T18:53Z,"@pp_11: It's clear upon listening that the song you mention is a poor original recording.  It's not an error with the rip.  I've spent a good bit of time listening to this since downloading and I haven't run into any errors (skips, pops), viruses, or other problems.  It's a great rip.  

Brilliant simply scraped the bottom of the barrel for recordings in order to obtain some obscure pieces and get the complete works.  For the most part the recordings are quite good. This set is better than the Mozart collection by Brilliant, which is rife with period instruments (yuck)."
,max_planck_no_1,2011-10-17T09:45Z,"Excellent torrent.

If you are looking for Rondo e capriccio ""Rage Over a Lost Penny"" it is located in CD 58.

Also, there is a pdf of all the tracks listed in the torrent so you can quickly find what ever you are looking for.

I hope classical music aficionados keep seeding this "
,killa12,2011-12-11T05:07Z,"I just downloaded this, and they are all .flac files.

I am trying to convert them in the built in vuze transcoder/converter/whatever and they all failed to convert.

Anyway, you might have to download a .flac to mp3 converter."
,CounterPillow,2012-02-16T00:56Z,"@killa12: FLAC stands for ""Free lossless audio compression"", if you convert them to MP3, you'll lower the quality. Use a media player like VLC to play them."
,tianbosi,2012-03-07T14:57Z,"If you don't like the hiss, just iTunes Match it. It's not hard. FFS this is free... you can fork out 25 bucks can't you for one-time. Stop whinging."
,tianbosi,2012-04-11T11:09Z,Anyone who says this is poor quality has no appreciation of great recordings made before the 1990s. Fantastic.
