Have never heard of Love and Distrust - have read the IMDb page (thanks for the link) but what did you think of it 2040?"

,skillet92,2010-11-05T11:09Z,At wat time will tv pack be uploaded?
,jon4fun,2010-11-05T13:19Z,"@ skillet92 - Please do not ask questions like that. If there was a problem with TPB UPloading then 20-40 would've left a comment by now. Just THINK and calculate. He is doing the Friday schdeule (not to mention shows he includes on request that aren't listed in schdule) in one torrent. That is a lot of shows and even if he starts ot 06:00 CET it takes time to DL & encode.

They will be UP when they are UP!

I'm not giving out, just please THINK!

Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-05T14:27Z,"Thanks Jon. It is extremely precise - I woke up at 6.04 AM and start downloading, even before first cup of coffee. Then - encoding. From 10:00 AM. Roughly at 2 RealTime speed for one pass. Multiplying that with two (number of passes) and with number of shows on specific day (today is definitely busiest day of week) gives a time to the point when I have finished with encoding. Then the upload to seeding sever - roughly 52 minutes for average show. So, one could multiply 52 minutes with number of shows. Add that to time for download of sources plus encoding time. 
It is wise to include at least minus-plus 60 minutes for occasional fuck-ups, as today, when FTP server decided to do  reset at 98% of The Mentalist upload.

Anyone can do the math.

Are out there miracles? Absolutely. I perform one each and every day. For few Thanks.

,dragonballz,2010-11-05T15:08Z,Thanks 20-40 for alll uploads. Please perform today's miracle and upload Big Bang theory.
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-05T17:03Z,@dragonballz: Look into today's TV pack.
