,Darko2.0,2010-11-03T00:02Z,"does this work on NTSC wiis? and I mean this particular game because some PAL games work on NTSC wiis and some don't. and this torrent has seeders, they are from wiisos.com so download anyway"
,damienisxcore,2010-11-03T00:29Z,Anonymous huh? Sounds nice and fishy.
,Strikefear13,2010-11-03T00:41Z,For once an anon upload might actually be legit.  It IS up in PAL and NTSC on wiisos.com so.. who knows.
,wiiS360,2010-11-03T01:19Z,where do you go on wiisos to find the games. i cant find it even when the page is translated
,damienisxcore,2010-11-03T06:58Z,no idea wiis360. i went to wiilikefree[dot]com. and found it fast. downloading now and reporting with results.
,VictorLEH,2010-11-03T10:19Z,"I downloaded this game from another site, but I can't play online. My internet works fine so maybe it's the torrent. If someone was able to play online, tell me"
,VictorLEH,2010-11-03T10:21Z,"I downloaded this game from another site but can't play online, tell me if u can with this one"
,Pirate.Tris,2010-11-03T11:24Z,"Game works great... works online.

Will seed to 100% another couple times.

,ooo003,2010-11-06T14:38Z,"Downloading a Wii iso usually takes a few hours, but this one is taking me days! Im stuck at 99.9% since yesterday. SEED SEED!!!"
,hcd888,2010-11-07T19:00Z,"Downloaed this and cant play it :( Getting a Error code, what version of Backup Launcher is everyone using??? Where can i download it?

Thanks"
,Zoiflite,2010-11-07T22:03Z,This worked flawlessly for me using a softmodded Wii with Uloader.
,hcd888,2010-11-08T03:12Z,"I have softmodded Wii with Gamma Backup manager, giving me error code.

I Burnt ISO to DVD, will Uloader allow me to play from DVD? Which is best loader to use to play this game of DVD?"
,Eddiejt,2010-11-08T11:28Z,"I was burning to DVD-R and getting Error 002. So I downloaded Uloader as an app to my SD card, and updated cIOS to 222 and it works!

Go here to DL Uloader and cIOS update: http://www.wiihacks.com/software-backup-loaders/62579-uloader-hermes.html

Put them into ""app"" folder on your SD card and the from homebrew run the cIOS update (select cIOS149 and then 222  when asked), then run Uloader.

 Let me know if it works."
,hcd888,2010-11-09T02:31Z,"Works Great :) Not Touched my wii in about a year But Thanks for the Help ULoader Works Great :)

Thanks for the help Eddiejt & thanks Anonymous for the torrent keep up the good work guys :)"
,psili,2010-11-09T03:50Z,Can confirm this iso works. I converted it to wbfs with wii backup manager and put it on a usb hdd. I also use Hermes Uloader (except with a couple of problem games like Metroid other M which work in configurable usb loader).
,Noogieman,2010-11-09T10:53Z,"I did not get this to work on my wiikey 1, but could be anything. I don't want to softmod so i might have to *gasp* buy it."
,fuckincrazyness,2010-11-09T15:49Z,"thanks man! this game kicks.  100% working so far.  but im only like 4 levels in.   and online works great too.   burned it to a dvd and ran it for a day. but the load times with neogamma r7 takes for ever.   so i loaded it onto an external hard drive. running thru usb loader GX on a 3.3u softmodded.   so much faster.  and the disc drive is nice and quiet now.  its region free. just launch it and it will play, dont change the settings to 480i ntsc or any of that shit.   thanx anon. its the real deal"
