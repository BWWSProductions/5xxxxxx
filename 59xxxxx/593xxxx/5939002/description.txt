Sinead Lohan  - Who Do You Think I Am - 1995

This is Sinead Lohan's debut CD.  It's more folksy than her second, No Mermaid.  This is the issue with 13 tracks.  

The disc was ripped using EAC.  The copy and test CRCs match but the EAC report says the tracks could not be verified as being accurate in the database.  "You might have a different pressing."  ???  Anyway, it sounds fine.  Log, cue and 
scans are included.
