Herein lies a complete set of piano sonatas by Franz Joseph Haydn. Often overlooked because of Haydn's massive output in other areas, these sonatas show a clear development in terms of both classical sonata form and Haydn's compositional style. These sonatas don't get the credit they deserve, so go ahead and take a listen.

This torrent has exactly the contents of the box set released by Decca, and as such contains several sets of variations, several single movements for piano, and the Seven Last Words of Christ for piano. Sonatas are numbered according to the Landon scheme, and note that sonatas numbered 21-27 are lost.

**Tagging is done as follows:
Artist == Composer
Album == Name of the work
Title == Title of a part or movement in a work
Genre == The performer(s)
Track == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.

I've done filenames as "%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title"



If there are any skips or pops in the files that I have missed, please comment and I will fix and upload that piece.
