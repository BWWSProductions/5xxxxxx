,lekkeralgemeen,2010-11-03T11:41Z,"Hi HR, when I add subtitles to your movies I always use MP4Box. However when added 1 subtitle I can't add another. I can add another, but iTunes won't show it. VLC however does show the second subtitle. Is is possible to add a second subtitle and what command do I have to use for it? For 1 subtitle I use this command: MP4Box -add MyMovie.srt:lang=nld:layout=0x60x0x-1:group=2 MyMovie.m4v 
I'm looking forward to your answer!"
,lekkeralgemeen,2010-11-03T11:42Z,I want this so that I have an english and a dutch subtitle track in my movies that I watch on my iPod...
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-03T12:49Z,hah your method sounds very similar to logic i posted a long time ago.  I would have to research this again.  Use subler if you own a mac.
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-03T15:36Z,"@lekkeralgemeen read the entire documentation located below.  I think you are missing a flag in your 2nd track.  The disable argument.  Try methods outlined exactly as I noted in documentation.

[T],qwersd,2010-11-03T15:47Z,"@HR will u be doing a handheld version of this and weeds?

@lekkeralgemeen what i do is hardcode 1 subtitle and rename the other subs 2 the same name as the file & then switch on the other subs whenever necessary"
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-03T16:03Z,not good to hard code subtitles.  yes handheld versions.
,lekkeralgemeen,2010-11-03T16:04Z,"I just tried this. In iTunes it just shows both subtitle tracks at the same time, but the little balloone thing isn't showing up, so I can't select one of the 2 subtitle tracks... In VLC it can show both again. But when subs aren't recognised on iTunes, they also aren't recognised on iPod. "
[T],qwersd,2010-11-03T16:26Z,"@HR yup often while hardcoding subs, the audio gets screwed..."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-03T16:29Z,"make sure subsequent subs are set disabled.  you may need to start from scratch again.

pretty sure this method works fine.  i cant actually test right at this moment.  later i can reverify process but it did work fine when i published documentation."
,lekkeralgemeen,2010-11-03T16:52Z,"IÂ´m going to test this out. But if this works. What to do when a file already has a subtitle embedded? Do I have to delete that subtitle track and add my tracks disabled again? And in your documentation, I don't really understand how to delete a subtitle track. Is there any way you can give a example command? Like: mp4box -rem (trackID)..."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-03T17:08Z,"removing tracks is pretty easy, look at the example, first get the track numbers with the -info command then run the remove it

MP4Box -rem TrackID #

I dont know if you need the word trackid and then track number.  Don't have mp4box right here to test.  sure it has builtin help.

formatting is goofed in the documentation it looks like.

if file comes with 1 subtitle embedded it should be set to active, just add another one with syntax show and make sure use disable argument.  Thats proper iTunes way as far as I know.

[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-03T17:40Z,"think can probably do most of this with yamb now, give it a try."
,lekkeralgemeen,2010-11-03T19:00Z,"Thanks for your help! Still didn't manage to get 2 subtitles in 1 file. But at least I now can remove those english subtitles and replace them with Dutch subtitles. This is pretty much OK with me. Maybe one day I will try to add multiple subs to a .m4v file, but not very soon I think... 
Looking forward to your Inception BRRip upload btw ;)"
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-04T06:26Z,"watched this movie tonight, pretty good."
