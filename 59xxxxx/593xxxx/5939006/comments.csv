Cause it's a Vinyl rip yo! "
,_kewlCat,2011-11-30T15:44Z,"Top Quality Recording. PS: Listen to FLAC 24/96 quality with the correct app to know how great a recording this really is. If you use winamp or iTunes, you might as well just rip from the cd and listen to mp3@128 quality. 

But, with the correct app and sound card (must be 24bit sound card), FLAC 24/96 will sound so much better than the actual CD in a CD player. Thanks npto :)
