Giving this torrent a -1 on quality for lying about it bein hi-ress and bu-ray rip when it isn't."
,pinkaholic,2010-12-06T16:46Z,yeah... but when i downloaded this one its really good for me quality video and audio... i dont know for u... ;)
,puppyup,2010-12-28T15:51Z,"The fact that it's only 700MB doesn't mean it's not a BRRip. It only means loss of quality due to less bitrate. Of course, it's always a very bad idea to choose 1280x712 when squeezing it into 700MB. This usually gets you a lot of artefacts and blurry crap. It's better to choose 480p for such small filesize."

I guess I will only be downloading from trusted uploaders from here on out, and definitely not ""Anonymous"". Watch yourselves."
