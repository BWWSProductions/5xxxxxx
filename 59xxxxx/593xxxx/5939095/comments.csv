,benriz,2010-11-07T13:57Z,do not download infected!!!!
,journey1956,2010-11-08T00:25Z,"@benriz...
I just scanned this with MSE and Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and it's clean. You come on here and say it's infected without telling us what the infection is or what anti-virus program you used to detect it. 

To everyone downloading this, it's clean. There's NO INFECTION!!!"
,journey1956,2010-11-08T02:55Z,I just mounted the ISO image of Hallmark Card Studio 2011 Deluxe-DVTiSO (BX) to a virtual drive and installed it. No viruses detected at all. I rescanned my whole operating system and all is good. Thank you Kill3rk for this great share. This program really rocks!! :0)
,jalf09,2010-11-16T18:44Z,"benriz is right! It's Infected! my AV just detected something on it!!!








LOL? New meme perhaps? "
,jdoshier,2010-11-19T08:01Z,Symantec and Malwarebytes both show clean here.
,954blade,2010-11-23T17:34Z,Cheers Kill3rk!
,unvest,2010-12-27T13:25Z,"Did not work for me, first very slow download, at burn ISO say files missin, install after mount same. Suck, wasted 3 hours...."
,Shazad,2011-01-01T02:36Z,"just finished downloading the ISO, no problems with the multicompressed files. Did a scan with Eset Smart Security ver. 4 with latest updates and found nothing, completely clean. Good job Kill3rk all the best for 2011 everyone!!!!"
,bbjuggler,2011-01-20T19:15Z,I am having a problem with the multicompressed files.  How do I decompress them?  Thanks!
,scooby576,2011-01-28T16:49Z,"Wont install after using  winrar 
error 1311 source file not found
waisted 3 hours"
,xyzcba,2011-02-14T00:42Z,"No virus--been running OK.  However, this version could not be updated.  The update process recognizes that this is a blacklisted version and prevents any update for corrections to program bugs and program enhancements.  This version crashes occasionally on a Win7x64 system when exporting a PDF version and/or saving an email AVI version of created cards to the hard drive."
,SilentINT,2011-02-17T05:15Z,"These guys must work for Hallmark. This isntalled fine with no issues asked and installed updates on first try. 

This is on Windows 7 x64"
,xyzcba,2011-02-20T17:47Z,"@SilentINT, thanks for your post.  The update does work now!  I've been using since this torrent was made available in Nov, and I've been trying to update in the last month but was unable until now.  I haven't check to see if the crashes have been corrected with this update yet.  But it was crashing just last week when I created several Valentine's Day cards.  Thanks again."
,oifwolf,2011-03-11T02:12Z,dont know why but i tried to install twice and got an error 1935. missing file.
,nmann22,2011-05-05T07:46Z,avg sucks always gets false positive it got NO virus
,Nightbreeder,2011-05-07T17:54Z,"Why is there always a n00b yelling virus alert on almost every single torrent.

Guys if you cant tell what a false positive is bye now, do us all a favour and purchase your software, or at least call someone that KNOWS what they are doing.

Try picking up a book if you need to... just stop yelling Virus alert everytime something pops up. We as Windows users have enough to worry about. LOL 

Anyways, thanx Kill3rk for the up, always appreciated !! 

There is NO virus in this torrent and the program works great."
,sk1ppy9O,2011-05-09T14:43Z,"downloading @ 1.9 MB/s.... not sure why everyone is saying it is slow, defiantly one of the faster torrents on TPB. Thanks Kill3rK! "
,shane1980,2011-05-09T16:20Z,"probably a stupid question, but i have not done it before.  But i really like this program.  How do i deal with all the winrar (zipped) files.  the instructions say mount iso....i know what and how to deal with iso...but there is like 25.  Not sure what to do with that.  Awsome dl kill3rk...will seed for a long time."
,neknonrev,2011-07-02T07:03Z,AVG says corrupted executable file Ltclru.dll but I find program works fine without that file
,laidrosi,2011-07-15T11:02Z,Where can I find the UK designs?
,countryfried,2011-10-19T06:08Z,"I have to agree with you Nightbreeder I'm new but been downloading here about 4 years now. I always rely on the comments if I haven't ever downloaded from the  uploader. 

Thanks Kill3rk it's gonna take a couple hrs I know cause it's 6 gig but that's all good it will b thru by morning"
,Spiritmoon69,2011-12-19T12:04Z,"Download, installed, no viruses, no problems!  Delighted, 10/10, thank you!"
,mizhop,2012-01-21T16:08Z,"I'm not a noob and don't usually have problems installing programs, so I was happy to see from the comments that most seemed to be having little difficulty with it.  To my dismay, I've been trying to install this program with no luck because of the following error:

""Error 1310. Error writing to file: 
C:\Windows\Font\A056013T.TTF. Verify that you have access to that directory.""

Followed by the Abort, Retry, and Ignore buttons.  If I ignore, it is followed immediately by the exact same error, only a different font file (B066000D.TTF), but with a Retry and Cancel buttons. ""Retry"", in both instances, of course, does nothing, so I have to Cancel and it rolls back the installation.

I've done an extensive search to find out if there's some workaround to get past this, with no luck. Apparently my issue is an anomaly, because I can't find it anywhere.  I've tried unlocking the font folder (ha ha), running the install in safe mode (with reg edit), loading the font files in question manually, any number of things.  I'm curious if this is one of those ""on-purpose bugs"" that creators put into their product to prevent install if it's not paid for.  Who knows.

I know this is a a long shot, but does anyone here have any ideas?  I've got Win 7."
,aaa19,2012-01-24T00:31Z,"Excellent Software - No problems in installation and working on Win7
Thanks Kill3rK  !!"
,TYiceT,2012-01-31T06:34Z,"Hey u guys the torrent DOES work, your getting that error message ""..file missing"" because you HAVE to open it as a .iso file and not just extract it.

I made the same mistake.

Download software such a magicdisk and mount the image and open it like you would a disk. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY IT WORKS.

Hope that helps! 

if you need more info on how to do this look it up on google..google how to use a .iso file."
,tymature,2012-03-05T14:06Z,"I prefer to use ""Virtual Clone Drive"" rather than ""Magic Disc""  Virtual Clone drive at least gives you an idea what is happening.  Magic Disc just gives you an open folder with a list of files in.  If you close the folder you have to ""Mount"" or install the iso file all over again.

When you install Virtual Clone Drive you will see an icon in the corner of the task bar.  Right click this icon and choose Mount.  Browse to the iso file.  Now there is a problem if you run WinRar like I do.  If you double click the ""d-211hcd.rar"" file WinRar will open its standard window with the ""d-211hcd.iso"" in that window.  Now how does Virtual clone Drive access that iso file?  It may not do it the first time you choose mount, and browse to the folder you just downloaded from Pi Bay."
,tymature,2012-03-05T14:07Z,"  It may not find it and the folder will be empty.  Try it two or three times and it will find it without WinRar intervening.  Right click on the file and choose ""Extract without confirmation"".  Remember it is Virtual Clone Drive that is doing the work.  Let it extract the files.."
