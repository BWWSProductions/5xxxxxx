,Marcelinho77,2010-11-07T23:02Z,"Not a retail, don't bother. Has the same problems with the fade outs in each song. Sucks."
,jessemcfan,2010-11-07T23:03Z,"Don't fall for this people, the quality is exactly the same as the other Rihanna ""deluxe"" torrent. The songs fade in and out all the time. Treat this as a preview. "
,benz3250,2010-11-08T02:47Z,The best on the net? This is straight up garbage. Tracks are looped. Do Not Download this crap.
