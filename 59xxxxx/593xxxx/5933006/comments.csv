,Raqo,2010-11-05T04:57Z,"Why do you always remove the included subtitles?
Please share the subtitles, better to have them than the sample."
[V],-jonny-,2010-11-06T00:23Z,It's an entirely English film. Subtitles are not needed.

,Vvornth,2010-11-06T11:49Z,"I'm from Sweden and understand English very good, but i still want subtitle because sometimes i can't hear what they are saying hehe. So i never watch a movie without subtitle. "
,meterish,2010-11-07T17:11Z,"yeah man, we need subs"
,khaled_br,2010-11-08T12:10Z,"@Vvornth well i also never watch a film without subtitles, english is my 2nd language and it always helps when there is something i dont understand
