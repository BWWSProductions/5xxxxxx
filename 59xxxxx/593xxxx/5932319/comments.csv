,g8aso,2010-11-06T10:44Z,"Yes it's in 320, but only in Joint stereo, not proper stereo at all.

>Joint Stereo shares certain bits between high frequency left and right channels. This improves compression efficiency at a slight loss of stereo separation.

Stereo includes two independent channels. The total bit rate remains constant, but the split between the channels can vary. The Encoder uses this flexibility to improve quality by allocating more bits to the channel with the more dynamic signal. Use the Stereo setting for best quality stereo audio at higher bit rates.

Dual Channel/Stereo includes two completely independent channels (left/right)

,grrleavemealone,2010-11-19T17:29Z,"FYI: The tracks are listed in the wrong order. This mistake is mirrored in the meta data. 

Not surprisingly, the ""Outro"" should be the final track. I'll just fix it in MP3Tag, but what a pain...."

,darkpoet1978,2011-01-29T18:20Z,Has nobody else noticed that this is a weird track listing?  It doesn't match up to any list I can find...
,doradhorror,2011-02-16T02:20Z,"To all the people hating on g8aso, he speaks the truth. 

Joint stereo is worse than normal stereo but most of you people probably wouldn't be able to hear the difference on your garbage Apple earbuds and Skullcandy headphones. 

Also the songs are all incorrectly tagged.  

Go ahead and claim ignorance, say I'm flaming or whatever, but I'm just speaking out for the truth. 

I personally would avoid this torrent."
,pseudoyou,2011-04-18T07:29Z,"fantastic album, thanks for the upload softwarez!"
,Kyle8275,2011-05-04T06:41Z,"In the words of Cee Lo Green.... ""Fuck you and uh Fuck You Too..."" jk jk"
,StickyCake,2011-06-01T04:59Z,"doradhorror--okay, since you know so much and we've all got rubbish headgear in our ears, how about dropping some serious knowledge on what we need to be using for the ultimate sound experience? Continue speaking this ""truth""."
