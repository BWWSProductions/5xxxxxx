,Tuppy,2011-09-09T19:36Z,"so this sound distortion, how long does it last?"
,ra73,2011-11-05T14:41Z,"Perfect quality copy, except:

- sound distorts very badly (loud white noise) for approx. 5 minutes during the first crucial action scene.

- there are a few lines of dialogue missing from the subtitles (most notably, during final scene)"
