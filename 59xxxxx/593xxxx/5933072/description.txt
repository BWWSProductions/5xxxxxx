 Few Small Repairs\" has been Shawn Colvin\'s most successful album, and won her the coveted Grammy Record of the Year and Song of the Year in 1998 with \"Sunny Came Home\", which was a Top 10 hit for her, and the album also received a Grammy nomination in \'97, as well as one for Best Female Pop Vocal for \"Get Out of This House\". 
It\'s a mellow, easy going collection of songs co-written by Shawn and producer John Leventhal, and the musicianship is excellent, with John also playing most of the instruments. 

Shawn\'s voice is not strong, but has a charming quality to it, with a soft huskiness and warmth that makes this CD very pleasant listening; its main substance is in its lyrics, which have a raw toughness to them...little intimate stories wrapped up in a melody. 
Favorites for me are \"Get Out of This House\", \"The Facts About Jimmy\", and the dreamy quality of \"Wichita Skyline\". 
It was the fabulous cover art that caught my eye and the reason I picked this CD up...the exquisite painting is by one of America\'s most inspired artists, Julie Speed.
