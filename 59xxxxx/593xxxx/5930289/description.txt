The ever-increasing interest in oceanography and marine biology and its relevance to global environmental issues creates a demand for authoritative reviews summarizing the results of recent research. This annual reference has catered to this demand for more than 40 years. It considers basic areas of marine research, covers subjects of special and topical importance, and addresses new areas as they arise. This volume features papers on ecosystem-based management of marine macroalgae; the ecology and management of temperate mangroves; the biology of vestimentiferan tubeworms; precious coral exploitation; and the historical reconstruction of human-induced changes in U.S. estuaries.
