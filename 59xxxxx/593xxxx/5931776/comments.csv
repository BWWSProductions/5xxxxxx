..would u do it?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-04T09:44Z,"@ibg270: Sure, click as many you like. I dealt with 480 minuses on single torrent. 
BTW (but you can't get it) - with every single click you prove MY POINT."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-04T09:51Z,"@ibg270: ...and FYI - I address specific posters with sign ""@"" (at) - meaning - IF THAT WAS FOR YOU - you'll know it... or not.

But, again, you are living proof - on thread for TV pack - you asked for show already upped... get the even the faintest clue?"
,jon4fun,2010-11-04T10:04Z,"@ All - I don't know or care who the idiot(s) are that rate a minus on ANY 20-40 encode. 
I have just one thing to say:
GO AWAY!

@ 20-40 - thanks for the excellent encodes, loving [In Treatment] & [SoA].

Cheers

[V],twentyforty,2010-11-04T18:47Z,"@tylr: I upload torrents for long time now, and sometimes six-seven in one  day. There is literary nothing I haven't heard or seen or read before, but you can bet your life that I responded more times on people's comments than anybody else... I am well known for preaching and repeating same frikkin shit over and over again..
However, if one don't get response - he should look at what he has been asking and on what way.

@ibg270: Sorry, I was pissed by 5 minuses for perfect encodes."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-05T11:29Z,@tylr: Casino - OK
