,TorrentG0110,2010-11-06T12:03Z,Thanks! I just started downloading now. Seems like you've done IVTC based on the frame rate. Excellent...hope the results are as good as I think they will be. I'll comment soon. Thanks again buddy!
,TorrentG0110,2010-11-06T12:15Z,"Great! Interlacing artifacts are gone, but video still doesn't play in PowerDVD without a transcode first.

I suggest using AutoMKV for 264 compression. It is an excellent software. 2 pass PS3 setting works excellent.

Thanks again."

,rigmar_radio,2010-11-07T16:12Z,"May I dare suggest that a 'proper' DVD Rip would to be NOT rip the file at all and just split the track by VOB ID from the DVD stream and post it as an ORIGINAL VOB (mpeg2) file which would in fact be about 180 MB and not 72.02 MB as posted here.    By using MAC compression software (very good as it is) you condem the majority of PC users to have to re convert this file to MPEG2 again to import it into any pro DJ software (most if not all of which does NOT run on a MAC).   Sadly when I did this the audio was out of sync as a result of the conversion, so I guess I will just have to wait for the same DVD to arrive in the post later this month sigh.   Thanks anyway for the effort.  I am sure a lot of people will still enjoy it as of course MKV can be played back on a PC using VLAN and other free software."
