,drjcv,2010-11-03T05:50Z,"you need to download, instal and create some sort of profile/account to play this. total bullshit."
,agosign,2010-11-03T07:12Z,"drjcv, you fu...ing idiot.!!

This works perfectly without downloading anything at all, as always with eztv first class uploads.
If you don't know just shut up, retard."

[T],artpepper,2010-11-03T11:02Z,"@drjcv- eztv provides nothing but quality downloads. This is an .avi file: you download it and watch it. That's it. No codecs, no accounts, no profiles--your comment is total bullshit."
