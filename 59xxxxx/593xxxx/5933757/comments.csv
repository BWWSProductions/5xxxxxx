Coronation Streetâ€™s Curly Watts and Reg Holdsworth, two of Britainâ€™s most enduring characters are being reunited in a special one of episode A Knightâ€™s Tale. They are joined by Norris Cole, Mary Taylor, Rosie Webster and Jason Grimshaw in a comedy of errors set at a medieval weekend within a stately home.

Curly â€“ now a high flying businessman with a chain of hotels under his Armani belt â€“ is giving Reg a chance to prove himself by hosting a medieval banquet weekend at Tatlock Towers. Things get off to a rocky start when Reg hires Rosie Webster as a serving wench under false pretences and sets his sights on Mary Taylor, despite her attachment to poor Norris.

A Knights Tale also stars Brian Capron in a cameo as a â€˜Dickie the boatmanâ€™ and Jeremy Edwards (Holby City, Dancing on Ice) as plastic surgeon Uri."
