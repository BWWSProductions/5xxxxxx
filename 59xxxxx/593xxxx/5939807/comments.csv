,DMVIN,2010-11-07T08:12Z,"Wow. It's as if u read my mind :-), thanks.

20-40, after my download completes, I keep the torrent for seeding but it never reaches the full potential of my upload speed merely hanging by at-0-10kbs. I tried with some torrents from EZTV and the upload speed is usually much higher. Any ideas?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-07T09:13Z,"@DMVIN: Maybe downloaders cannot establish valid connection with your program, for various reasons: they use programs contrary to my recommendations and stubbornly refuse to apply settings I posted here gazillion times. What's the reason for such behavior is well known fact.

Beside, if you seed whenever am I present, it's hard to expect to achieve high upload speed because I am definitely fast enough and you cannot,  sort of speak, to step forward.

That's why I have bagged for selective uploading for people who can - I have lot of dead torrent or torrents with few dozen seeders who can seed at snail speed... and cause more harm than good. I cannot keep files on seeding server longer than two, maybe few days... So, whenever you spot lack of seeders (not on TPB page 'cause it's useless shit - but as they are shown in your program) stay and seed for a while.

Be careful, after let say 48h came just comers&goers and hit&runners, they suck you dry, grab a file and run away, seeding back a squat."
