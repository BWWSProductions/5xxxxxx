Researchers are increasingly studying corrosion of steel in concrete due to the deterioration of concrete structures all over the world. Covering all aspects of this subject, this book discusses different techniques for protecting steel reinforcement and for repairs after corrosion has begun. Stressing the importance of implementing integrity management systems for maintenance strategies, the author examines economic analysis procedures as well as the probability of structural failures to define structure weight risk and loads. This text offers a practical approach to corrosion diagnosis and to choosing the appropriate methods of repair.
