- Big Gains in State Races Position Republicans to Alter Political Landscape in Upcoming Redistricting

The midterm election could impact the country's political landscape for years to come as states prepare to redraw congressional districts for the first time in a decade. Republicans now hold more state legislative seats than they have since 1928 after winning 600 state legislative races, 19 legislative chambers, and 21 governor's seats. These gains will have a big impact when state lawmakers begin to decide how to redraw the district boundaries for the U.S. House of Representatives. To explain these changes, we are joined by Michael McDonald, a redistricting expert at George Mason University.


- As Right-Leaning "Blue Dogs" Lose Seats, Democrats' Progressive Caucus Increases Plurality in Next Congress

The Democrats lost the House in Tuesday's midterms but what is the makeup of the new Democratic House caucus?

A new investigation published in The Texas Observer looks into one aspect of the collateral damage of our current immigration laws that result in tens of thousands of unaccompanied migrant children being deported to Mexico every year.
