,trymbill,2010-11-29T15:20Z,"I'm not getting this to work.

I've got a PS3 bought in Europe running PAL, jailbroken with PSFreeDom from iDroid on an iPhone 2G with Hermes Payload V3.

No matter what I try, I always get a BSOD (Black Screen of Death) where my projector just says it's displaying 720p 60hz and then nothing happens.

I tried opening it via an external HDD with Open Manager v2.1I, that didn't work.  I tried copy-ing it onto the internal drive with Open Manager v2.1I and then opening it, that didn't work.  I tried opening it from the internal drive with Backup Manager 2, that didn't work.

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but I'm just not getting this version to work on my PS3."
