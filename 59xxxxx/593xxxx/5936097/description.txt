In this exclusive interview for Prison Planet.tv subscribers, author Webster Tarpley goes into detail on a whole host of historical, financial and geopolitical issues in a bid to outline the major crises, revolutions and wars that will hit the globe over the next decade and shape the future of our world.

Tarpley begins by discussing how the Neo-Malthusian ecological extremists in the Obama regime have a shared hatred for science, technology and industry and how they really are contemplating and initiating genocidal measures to thin the human surplus because of their deep-seated ideological impulse, shared by oligarchies throughout the ages, which is to suppress the progress and development of any societal underclass.

Tarpley explains how throughout history elites have always claimed that the planet was overpopulated in a bid to justify their wars and brutality, and that this is no different today, with people like Prince Philip expressing their desire to come back as a virus in order to kill masses of humans.

Moving on to how these elitists use the financial system to further their aims, Tarpley explains how the move towards a global currency and worldwide financial regulations is being advanced by the IMF, but how nations are now rejecting this "Washington Consensus," and instead adopting the "Beijing Consensus," which allows them to retain control over their own national sovereignty. Tarpley says that the dollar as the world reserve currency is toast and that it is set to be replaced by a synthetic imperialist global currency called the Bancor. Tarpley warns that the IMF dictatorship is now in the final stages of asset stripping the United States.

Tarpley goes on to discuss how the Obama administration and its geopolitical guru Zbigniew Brzezinski are keen to manipulate a war between Iran and Russia or Iran and China, by engineering fake color revolutions which will then install parties hostile to the two Communist states.
