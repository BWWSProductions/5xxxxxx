[T],FaMoUz,2010-11-09T03:48Z,"@babygirl220 download a program on here called ultra ISO tha premium version.. that werkz 4 me


http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4638832/Ultra_ISO_With_Serial


download n install.. c if that werkz"
,babygirl220,2010-11-09T06:58Z,okay i downloaded it and tried it but it still does the same thing the cursor doesn't show up or any of the bottom icons.
,wrongway6909,2010-11-09T20:17Z,"okay so this game is really easy to get running if you know what youre doing. for those of you who dont, this is for you =]


when you download the torrent you will see two folders CD1 and CD2.

in each folder there is a .bin file. 

first, mount the .bin file in the CD1 folder and it will auto-install. at about 40% of the way into the install it will ask you to insert disk 2.

go into the CD2 folder and simply click and drag the .bin file onto daemon tools to mount it. 

now it will finish installing.

just launch the game and enjoy. "

,doyoumindifislytherin,2011-08-04T03:36Z,"Ok for all you noobs out there like me, here`s how to crack this. 
I`m glad I figured out how to do this :D

1. Download free trial of UltraISO
2. Open Nancy Drew folder in UltraISO
3. Click on CD1 folder and find Mount To Virtual Drive icon in UltraISO
4. A new window should pop up 
5. Click the ... button under Image File
6. Find CD 1 folder
7. Click MOUNT
8. When it`s done, go to Computer
9. Click on the virtual hard drive [In my case it`s called CD Drive (G:) SAW Disk 1]
10. Click on the setup.exe folder
11. Start installing
12. When the program asks you to insert CD 2, do steps 3-7, selecting CD 2 folder this time
13. When you`ve mounted it, go back to the installer and press ok [you`ve inserted Disc 2]
14. Wait for the rest of the DL and enjoy! :D

Still haven`t tried playing it yet but will update you if these steps don`t work ^^;"

,clingwrap,2012-02-08T01:33Z,Need a registration code :/ took a while to figure out for mac and now all I need is a code!
,clingwrap,2012-02-08T01:50Z,SERIAL NUMBER!
,mansanas,2012-03-28T11:07Z,"@clingwrap / @NDSAWE / @smokebundy / @ meaghanhalloran_ 

I don't understand, you guys installed the game on your macs??? I have toast titanium 11 to burn music and movies, but to install windows games??? How does that even work??? (sorry, maybe I just don't understand tech stuff)"
,icecreamxtwin,2012-04-06T20:15Z,"AWESOME! It works like a charm, cursor included :D

First time installing a game, but it's easy with the right programs. I used PowerISO, it's a free program and you don't need a serial number.

1) After torrent is loaded, open PowerISO
2) Click the button ""Mount""
3) Select ""Mount Image to Drive"", and select which drive. This is most likely Drive [F:]. After doing this, a uploading window should pop up
4) Open your torrent folder
5) Select CD 1
6) Open the .bin file
**The file is now mounted. This means that you are able to open the file without extracting. Extracting is essentially when multiple files within a file are copied and saved to a folder of your choosing.**
7) Open ""My Computer""
8) Open the SAW (Shadow at the Water's Edge) file
9) Install

Once it is halfway through, it'll ask for disk two. On PowerISO, simply unmount the current file, and follow steps 2 - 6 with the CD 2 .bin file."
