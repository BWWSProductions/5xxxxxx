	It may be a stretch to say that if you dont like Kind of Blue, you dont like jazz â€” but it's hard to imagine it as anything other than a cornerstone of any jazz collection.	

IMO this is the best sounding version of this recording....
However, the Classic Records Reissue is listed in Michael Fremers list of 157 in-print LPs you should own
