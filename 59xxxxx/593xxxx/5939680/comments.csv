,BrokenEmpires,2010-11-08T20:54Z,"Is this the full version. Why hasn't anyone created a crack or key generator for Retail Point of Sale software? This torrent is a big waste of fucking time. All these cocksucker uploaders never include the full version. this that bullshit 30.
Can somebody upload Microsoft Dynamics POS 2009 with a key that works instead of that bull shit 
email me 120 dollars and ill give you the key crap. "
,Shaffaan,2010-11-09T06:28Z,"Umm, im stuck! Instructions please?"

you expect someone to upload your request with this kind of attitude.you must be out of your mind."
,LeXX13,2010-11-12T13:37Z,"Hi, Blacktroy, thanx for your torrents.Unfortunatly i can,t download Vector Works 2010 which you had - only 54 percents, can you seed it any more please, i need it very much. I'll seed then as far as a can. "
,loquorlicker,2010-12-03T23:54Z,"""...looking at your profile. there is no single upload from you""

Just FYI, I have perhaps fifty uploads but you won't find any of them under this one.  I agree with you though except for one thing: needy whiney people don't deserve any attention."
,h3sesso,2011-01-10T06:50Z,This is garbage. Look for beast version of this... Its POS 8 and has the crack in the download. 
,bogey111,2011-03-01T12:45Z,If a product doesn't have a bar code how do you enter the price manually? 
,FoamyDog,2011-06-13T19:29Z,BrokenEmpires is an idiot. This works perfectly.
,level9phreak,2011-07-09T01:27Z,Is the product and license number on the image somewhere?  I looked everywhere on the image and didn't see anything.

,Metalsand,2012-05-22T20:00Z,"Did I apply the registry hack incorrectly, or does the hack just trick the QB software into thinking it's in trial mode permanently, rather than trick it into thinking that it was registered?"
