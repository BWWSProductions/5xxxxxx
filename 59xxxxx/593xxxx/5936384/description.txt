In 1982 BBC television aired a 30 minute concert from Meat Loaf. It was from a German concert in 1981 for ZDF tv. Meat Loaf was guest for the Pop Rock show of December 19th, 1981. 
This is the BBC broadcast (the ZDF broadcast will follow later this month) with 4 tracks. I added two great clips from 1978's Saturday Night Live with a fantastic performance of Two out of Three. These two clips alone are worth the download of the dvd.
