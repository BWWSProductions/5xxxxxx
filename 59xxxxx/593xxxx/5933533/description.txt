Release Title The American 2010 R5 LINE SecretMyth (Kingdom-Release)

Storyline Alone among assassins, Jack is a master craftsman. When a job in Sweden 
ends more harshly than expected for this American abroad, he vows to his contact Pavel that his next assignment 
will be his last. Jack reports to the Italian countryside, where he holes up in a small town and relishes being 
away from death for a spell. The assignment, as specified by a Belgian woman, Mathilde, is in the offing as a weapon 
is constructed. Surprising himself, Jack seeks out the friendship of local priest Father Benedetto and pursues 
romance with local woman Clara. But by stepping out of the shadows, Jack may be tempting fate.
