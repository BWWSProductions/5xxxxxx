,Ebay42,2010-11-05T05:48Z,The King is Back!!!!!!
,Naveen_A,2010-11-05T17:07Z,This is a wonderful week. Both SM and 3Li are back. Welcome back guyz.
,oldSMfan,2010-11-06T01:12Z,"@ sabby2013
Hope so ... don't see why. HDLiTE are after all LC & Deaftone, so SM would fit right in nicely.

Some1 mentioned 3Li is back, that's xllent. HR (HolyRoses is, 2!)

4 those who do not know, IceBane's xllenet, 2. He's just started on 1080s ... & they're perfect.

Wrath has disappeared, I think. He was good, 2. Above 3000 bitrate seems to be a perfect target. However, for some reason SM/HDLiTE/IceBane provide crisper colours than HR.

:O) 

- Long live everyone ... "

,oldSMfan,2010-11-08T08:41Z,"Yeah, I know. A bit harsh, ain't it? Sorry ""jayawarden"". Accept my appologies, M8. 

It is just that you gotta accept what there is and say a big ""THANK YOU"" to all Ulers. REMEMBER: They do this unselfishly. They make these tors available to us for free. That is why I say ""Thank You"" to all of them, no matter what quality/size/rip! So even you are a popular HDLiTE, SM, 3Li, LTT, or another not-so-popular, thnx! Thank you!

CHeers TommyBlade2018, jayawarden & sabby2013.
