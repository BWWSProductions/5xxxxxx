,thepunisher65,2010-11-07T05:42Z,"@ twenty forty...

you've got a nice encoding talent..keep it up...clean work..."
,vartialos,2010-11-07T05:48Z,"Hey 20-40 , thank you very very much for all your work. Could you please tell me how to convert these files and burn them on a dvd ???"
,thepunisher65,2010-11-07T05:48Z,"got a request for u buddy...just came through a new release called ""THE JIGSAW FILES""... please do if you can... would like to see a small file of yours... thanks for the beautiful encodes.."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-07T05:58Z,"@nikoHD: More than dozen torrents are on TPB, for example:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5845389/Johnny_English_[2003]_720p_x264_[TYNYFYD]_"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-07T06:09Z,"@vartialos: Most of the new players support MP4 already, PS3 and Xbox too. Standalone media players (devices) cost from 38 bucks upward. Any newer computer graphic card has TV or HDMI output.

Point is: one loose too much with any conversion. Time and electricity cost something too.

However, many people reported here that ConvertXtoDVD works great."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-07T06:34Z,"@ALL: Read for fuck's sake JUST NINTH LINE ABOVE... Please...

@thepunisher65: LOL to ...""you've got a nice encoding talent""

Somehow, I should feel offended by that (but I am not). You are, simply, too fresh in all this...

You know... this planet is older than 6500 years. People learn to write back then, but planet existed for billions of years before.

Regarding Jigsaw Files, because you thanked in comment before, I would look into it, and if encode turns OK - you'll see the torrent.

@sparhawk365: Thanks for thanking. Knucklehead is out there, in many colors, shapes and sizes."
,vartialos,2010-11-07T08:55Z,"@twentyforty Thanks, will check it out."
,thepunisher65,2010-11-07T09:07Z,"@ twenty forty...

well i am not at all a fresher in all these stuffs...also i have been into all these things & encoding groups since a long time...i meant it...& i did like your works..keep it up... there was nothing in it to feel offended...was a pure compliment...!! "
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-07T10:31Z,"@thepunisher65: No Jigsaw Files from me. Source is really ugly (lot of skipped frames in second part).
I lost 2h on encoding and in two tries to fix that, but I cannot. Sorry. However, I still have no idea what it was - sort of compilation of previous parts - sequences from Saw movies for over-the-top fans."
,bahanee,2010-11-08T22:04Z,"can u plz upload ""Life as we know it""===plz and thanxx"
