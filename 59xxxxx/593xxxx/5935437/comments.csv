,PhilLesh12,2010-11-05T04:11Z,then stop talking to me in your torrent details.
,tbone3181,2010-11-05T05:29Z,"PhilLesh12 who the fuck do you think you are? TPB police? ranting like some deluded psycho, do you realize how pointless all your comments are? ""hmmm but if you check the comment i wrote on that first torrent i was blah blah blah""-SHUTTHEFUCKUPALREADY!! and mc_homes made it clear several times to stop commenting, even telling u in the torrent details...HE IS NOT TALKING TO YOU A$$HOLE"
,bundoodle,2010-11-05T13:04Z,"phillesh12 , you are the reason why i do not upload onto TPB . 
having to read what some 12 year old troll has to offer would do my head in especially as you like to comment on mc_homes every torrent . 
give the guy a fekin break , he is contributing to the community and all you can do is troll .

what have you uplaoded in the so called 4 1/2 years you have been here..........fuk all .

mc_homes , do you have a demonoid account ? 

if not , reply to this comment & i will sort you out one .

guaranteed that you'll actually get some apprieciation from the demonoid community for uploading rather than getting stalked by some dick . 
give me a email address that you dont use so often ( as posting a good email address will have phillesh12 cream his pants , then he could personally stalk you ;) )& i will send you an invite . it will be from badmanbund . "
,bundoodle,2010-11-05T13:05Z,"forgot to add 

great torrent nice 1 for the up"
,korasi,2010-11-05T16:24Z,Cheers bud nice one!!
,cow_man,2010-11-05T21:00Z,Some artifacts and sound jumps up part way through but still watchable
,mc_homes,2010-11-06T04:00Z,"@bundoodle: thanks for your appreciation.  And yes, i do have a demoniod account.  I use demoniod sort of as a backup if i can't find what i want here.  It is a great site, and i always seed to ratio, but i'd rather give carl to the people free and clear so that is why i posted it here.  it is a shame trolls like the one and only phillesh are around, but he is only one out of 700 who are enjoying this.  i just wish i could block him from downloading this.  It would be great to exclude him from watching it, haha,.  i can hear his useless dribble about it now :)  oh, and thank you for the demonoid offer as well.


@cow_man: yeah the last 3 episodes have had a few skips, artifacts, and slight sync problems.  I downloaded the version eztv upped, to compare, and it is a little cropped and the quality isn't as good.  I guess you gotta pick and choose.  But i am sure a good copy of the season will come out soon..because it is being released on dvd and blueray soon if not already :)



and a final note, phillesh you are a hairy twat..and the grateful dead suck! :D hehehe!

,1THEONLYONE1,2010-11-08T00:08Z,"I have a theory; 

Karl Pilkington=PhilLesh12

However PhilLesh12 is not funny and just a prick"
,PhilLesh12,2010-11-11T10:43Z,"Wow, the echo chamber of idiots!

No, I have not uploaded anything.  But I have seeded to 35.000 ratio on everything I download, and I quickly alert the admins to fakes every chance I get.

I'm sorry if you haters and angry folks can't take the time to understand that.

mc_homes, you are probably a decent person, but obviously an angry one, and one that doesn't take time to learn about people.  So you judge, instead.

I'm sorry for you.

Luckily, the series is over.  We will hopefully never meet again.

But, if this uploader hasn't been deleted yet, please go and see why I doubt new uploaders, and why many others do, as well.  He's been uploading ""DVDRIP"" movies, and TV Shows that didn't air tonight because of the Country Music Association's awards on ABC.  

http://thepiratebay.org/user/31inpirate/

He uploaded S02E08 of the Middle and Modern Family, even though tvrage.com and tvguide.com show them both as being aired on November 17th.

I know there's a lot of hate with people who don't like to read too much, but hey, that's not my fault."

,PhilLesh12,2010-11-11T11:06Z,"Seriously,  These are the kinds of DMCA contractors I've been trying to keep off of this site.

If you understand how they hire companies to post garbage, and track down users and uploaders, you might understand where I was coming from.

If not, then, please, keep hating me.

,PhilLesh12,2010-11-11T11:16Z,"Maybe I'm wrong, but if you go to tvrage.com, you'll see that Modern Family didn't air tonight.

So maybe I was wrong to be cautiously doubtful of a new uploader with An Idiot Abroad, but I usually get things right.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5949156/Modern_Family_S02E08__HDTV_XviD_-_LOL

Tell me I'm a dick for calling 31inpirate out for posting an episode that didn't air this week.

I'm waiting for the hate."
,PhilLesh12,2010-11-11T11:37Z,"...Or, maybe you might figure out that people on this site, like me, are only trying to keep it safe for people who have the courage to upload stuff that large corporations would prefer not be uploaded?  

You do know about the hundreds of cases of uploaders, and downloaders, around the world, who were prosecuted for their activity on bittorrent?

You do keep your client set to forced encryption, and do not allow legacy connections, don't you?

This community is all about safety.  Safety in numbers, safety in vigilance, safety in cooperation, safety in being cynical or doubtful of newcomers.

I would hope you knew that.  You have to be weary before you can trust.  

You can't be a total douche bag and demand trust before you prove that you can be trusted."
,PhilLesh12,2010-11-11T12:26Z,"People who are trying to get rid of industry stooges who upload garbage are just assholes.

I mean, yeah, there's nothing wrong, right???

The owners of this site are under siege, and yet we should trust everyone with no upload history?

They were still found ""guilty"", even though it's preposterous.

If you want to be dragged through the courts, then hate on the people like me.  If you woud rather be left alone to do as you please, then let those of us who are trying to stop the copyright owners from interfering and tracking this site, be.

Let us do our thing.  It only serves the community.

... Or you can keep being a hater."
