The band can be traced back as far as vocalist Piet Sielck and guitarist Kai Hansen's school act Gentry. This act was to win a school competition with a combination of original songs and covers from Uriah Heep, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. A demo was recorded before the addition of drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg and bassist Markus GroÃŸkopf as a name change ensued to Second Hell (Deu). Tracks written during this period such as "Gorgon", "Phantoms Of Death", "Murder" and "Victim Of Fate" would later come to attention on the debut Helloween album. This period also saw the birth of the latter day Gamma Ray track "Heading For Tomorrow".
