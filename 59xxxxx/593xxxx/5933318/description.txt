    Wallace and Gromit explore the wonders of the natural      
    world and look at inventions inspired by Mother Nature.   
    We visit some incredible flying penguins and other       
    elegant Manta Ray-inspired robots at Festo in Germany     
    and visit Malawi, where scientists are studying the        
    intricate structures of termite mounds to create          
    self-cooling houses of the future.                       
                                                              
    In Holland we meet the brilliant sculptor Theo Jansen      
    as he shows us his latest amazing contraption, the        
    Animaris Siamesis - a huge insect-like structure that    
    moves independently and gracefully with the wind. In      
    Israel, Jem Stansfield meets a man who has invented a      
    fish-like 'gill' which could allow humans to breathe      
    underwater and we look at some weird and wonderful       
    fly-eating furniture based on the Venus Fly Trap plant    
    and other carnivorous plants. Finally, Wallace, with       
    the help of his friend Goronwy, gives us a run-down of    
    his top five animal-inspired inventions.
