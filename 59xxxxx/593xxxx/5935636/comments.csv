,Hi-5,2011-01-10T17:38Z,"This is NTR v3.1.0, and it's not for Norton 360. If I need to explain
how to find out then you ought to go watch tele-tubbies.

The uploader might as well add the correct NTR info to torrent description so that
users know what they can expect.

For those who are totally unaware of it: so far there's NTR2011 v3.0.0 BETA, NTR2011 v3.0.1,
NTR2011 v3.1.0, NTR2011 v3.1.3, and the latest NTR2011 v3.2.0 (as of date).
NTR2011 v3.0.1 was pulled back by BOX, and duo to a Norton program update NTR2011 v3.1.3
now causes problems for Norton v18.5.0.125."
