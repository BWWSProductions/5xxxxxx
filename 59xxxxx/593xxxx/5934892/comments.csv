,Raghu1983,2011-08-13T07:23Z,"Hi YIFY.I've been a regular visitor to ur site and i've been dwnlding ur movies for a while now. I'm sorry that it took me so long to make an account at piratebay and thank u for all those great movies that u hav uploaded. but i guess its better late than never. 
So now, I hav registered at piratebay for the sole purpose of thanking u for all those great uploads. Getting all those movies in such small file size and that too with such great quality...WOW!!! thats absolutely amazing. To be frank, apart from one movies(i dont remember which one though) all the others that i hav dwnlded from ur site have been great. So once again thank u very much and keep up the good work."
