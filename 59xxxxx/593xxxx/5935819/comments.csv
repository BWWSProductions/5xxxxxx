Does anybody know what the song is that is played during the ""europa league"" ad on ten action+?

Note :it's not ""Ozzy Osbourne-Let Me Hear You Scream"" or the ""Official theme song of UEFA europa league"", it's sung by a female artist and the keyword in the song is ""boy"" i think and at the end of the ad announcer says ""meet the boys in the europa league"" only on ten action "

wtf??????????? 64k for the audio. good lord. at least if your gonna rip it in he+aac (in assuming thats the codec) bump it to 80kbps at least. then again. wtf the whole thinkg is 671!!!! and its 720p?????????????????????? the only people you fooled are the not knowing. thanks anyway. but i just think this is a weird file size."
