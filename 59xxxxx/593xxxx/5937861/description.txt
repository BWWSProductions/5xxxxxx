On this program, John analyzes the results of the Tuesday mid-term elections in the USA, with the help of his guests. John attempts to answer the question, did some voters shy away from certain candidates out of ignorance and a misconception of what libertarians are really about?

The core theme: did Libertarians get their ideas across to the public? Did Libertarians win? With Tea Party candidates and protesters getting much attention in this cycle, John also takes another look at the Tea Party and its ideology to see whether it really squares with that of most Libertarians. And, we hear from typically great guests, among them Ron Paul, Bill O'Reilly, and favorite Fox News liberal contributor, Ellis Henican.
