date: 96-08-03
Venue: Centre Molson

Recording: AUD
Quality: 6(+)
Menu: NO
Extras: None

Comments: Single cam very high on the balcony stage left (the filmer is actually shooting down when Gene's on the light rig!!). Shot mostly on screen. Shaky, poorly shot, and obstructed. Picture quality is obviously generated and pixelated. Audio is distant and muffled. This is really only for the real die-hards and possibly for people who were there that night.
