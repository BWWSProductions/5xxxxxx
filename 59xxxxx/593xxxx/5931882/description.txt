National Inflation Association has released their latest documentary film, End of Liberty. Featuring trends forecaster Gerald Celente.

'End of Liberty' exposes from a real life perspective how the U.S. is heading towards a complete societal collapse. Many Americans have been experiencing countless warning signs on a daily basis that a collapse is near, unfortunately, most don't understand the significance of these warnings. Each warning sign by itself doesn't appear to have a lot of meaning, but together they present a very detailed picture of the current state of the United States economy and where this country is soon headed.
