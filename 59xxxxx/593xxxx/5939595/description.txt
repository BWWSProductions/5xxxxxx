The quality of the majority of the videos is very good (DVD rips) however some of the rarer videos (TTTV, James Brown, PE) are VHS rips and so the quality drops but they are almost impossible to find anywhere else. Thanks to the original uploaders of this material which include Fats Comet, Beat Junkie, Jimmy S., redperks
