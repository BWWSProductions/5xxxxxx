,Elwood42087,2010-11-09T02:57Z,"Just updating, after watching, it appears that this is in fact the pilot, titled ""The Big One"" and the quality is perfect for a 350 MB 42 minute show.  "
,ZR145,2010-11-14T09:39Z,Shoulden't Episode 2 be out yet?
,Elwood42087,2010-12-01T06:08Z,"From what I can tell, episode 2 of this did air (once) but I missed it, and it seems that nobody has uploaded it online.  beyond that I have no idea, I haven't seen anything about it from Discovery channel and it is suspiciously absent from the website.  To top it off, a quick Googling turned up a Utah Department of Transportation Facebook post saying the show was cancelled because the weather made it too difficult to make, hard to believe from the same channel that does Deadliest Catch.  Lets all just keep our hopes up."
