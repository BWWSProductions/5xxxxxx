,priex10,2010-11-08T04:24Z,can someone rate the quality of video and audio? The screenshots posted aren't working
,muhu88,2010-11-08T04:35Z,"I'll wait for good copy
anyway thanks"
,EbilPhish,2010-11-08T04:45Z,"Video isn't great. It's a 4:3 (but it's in 16:9 ratio by default so you need a player that will let you fix the ratio). Quality is better than a cam but it's still fairly cam like.

Audio quality is very good.

My best guess is a PPV rip involves a direct audio hookup via a headphone jack from a hotel TV, but recording using a video camera directly in front of the TV set (which is better than a cinema one since it's not at an angle, but is only 4:3).

It would be great to combine PPV audio with R5 dvd rips, but that's not likely to happen often.

Otherwise if someone smart can figure out how to get the video feed directly from whatever the PPV unit does."
,EbilPhish,2010-11-08T04:48Z,"Also there are screenshots of this release that still work on this torrent:

,Flimx,2010-11-10T07:51Z,"Just downloaded this one, havent seen the whole movie yet. But from what ive seen so far, this is a better copy then whatever is posted before. Its not superduper great quality, but it works.. the dvd is not yet released so cant really expect anything better for the time being. 

Kudos SAFCukO09"

The colors are pretty bright at times, but it's watchable. I'd wait for the DVDRip though, if you enjoy watching these animated movies with good colors and smooth animations that is..."
,Amak8989,2010-11-17T03:30Z,Fuck no man its shit 
,KickassWashingMachine,2010-11-20T12:38Z,"Okay, if this is a Pay-per-View rip, then someone in Russia or Afghanistan must be the one to have paid to view this clearly bootleg cam version being broadcast as PPV. Even the aspect ratio is fucked. Note to ripper: If the original movie is widescreen and your source is pan/scan in 4:3, you don't get the original aspect ratio by stretching it! Also, if you're willing to rerip a cam source just because it's being broadcast as PPV, then there's seriously something wrong with you.
