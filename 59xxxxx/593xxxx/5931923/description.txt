Judging from the number of downloads of shows that I've packaged into H.264 MP4's, there appears to be a large demand for these shows in a modern video container. AVI's have become obsolete. Good riddance. 

However, to support these and future downloads I ask YOU KEEP SEEDING after your download is complete. I suggest you set a minimum UL speed of 30 kB/s by right clicking on the torrent in your Bittorrent client and adjusting the Bandwidth Allocation. This will free up my bandwidth for new torrent uploads. THANKS!

I took VIDEO TS files of each concert from their source and ripped H.264 MP4 files of each movie. The files have a suffix of .m4v as they were ripped using HandBrake 0.9.4 so they can be played on any current iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or in iTunes. They can also be played on any compliant player but you may need to change the suffix from .m4v to .mp4.

Peter Gabriel: POV (from 1990 LaserDisk)

POV, executive-produced by Martin Scorsese, is a document of a 1987 concert gig in Athens. It catches Gabriel running through some of his better-known solo numbers â€” ''Biko,'' ''Solsbury Hill,'' ''Shock the Monkey'' â€” with a crack band.

Ripped from LaserDisc so this is about as clean as you can get. The limitations of the 1987 era video show but it is a very worthwhile look at Peter in the late 80's

Track list:

- This is the Picture;
- San Jacinto;
- Shock the Monkey;
- Games Without Frontiers;
- No Self Control;
- Mercy Street;
- Sledgehammer;
- Solsbury Hill;
- Lay Your Hands on Me;
- Don't Give Up;
- In Your Eyes;
- Biko
