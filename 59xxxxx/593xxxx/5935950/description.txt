Country music may be the farthest thing in the minds of fans when they the hear the name Gwyteth Paltrow. The actress is long known for her serious performances, her spot as the cover girl of Estee Lauder and more recently for her leading role as Pepper Potts in the Iron Man movie franchise. The 37-year-old, Los Angeles native is now adding a less likely notch to her belt: that of country singer.

Paltrowâ€™s first single comes in the form of â€œCountry Strong,â€ which is an uplifting ballad with a rock guitar break and a Southern drawl. A more mature version of Miley Cyrusâ€™s â€œThe Climb,â€ â€œCountry Strong delivers every bit of energy and strength. Even if a little more deliberately and a little less polished, the song is as convincing and effective as many a female-lead in country right now.

Perhaps playing off of her husbandâ€™s (Coldplay frontman Chris Martin) obvious talent, or her upcoming role in the country musical â€œLove Donâ€™t Let Me Down,â€ Paltrow appears to fall comfortably into the role of country crooner. The voice is powerful and emotive, conjuring early Martina McBridge or contemporaries like Sara Evans.

The song is about the country strength of Paltrow and women like her: â€œcountry strong, and hard to break, like the ground I grew up on.â€ It is a message of redeeming fortitude and the attitude that it takes to carry yourself with the strength. Still working her way into her new country voice, Paltrow finds her way around easy couplets and over virtuoso guitars.

The singerâ€™s new profession may or may not take her into a side step from her day job, it is yet to be announced if or when an album will be forthcoming, but she can now hold her own among any musical conversations at the dinner table.

Country Strong (formerly titled Love Don't Let Me Down) is an upcoming drama film about a country singer named Kelly Canter. It stars Gwyneth Paltrow as Kelly Canter and Garrett Hedlund as Beau Williams and is directed by American filmmaker, Shana Feste. It is set for release on December 22, 2010.
