     Two more families compete for the title of Britain's      
     best cooking family.                                     
     On the menu today: a seven-minute supper of sausage and 
     rosemary skewers, which viewers can cook along to at     
     home. Actor Ricky Groves talks about his early career     
     as a chef and makes cod boulangere with roasted garlic,  
     while Si and Dave plate up a warming coq au vin rouge.
