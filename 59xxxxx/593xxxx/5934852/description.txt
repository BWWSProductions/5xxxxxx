	...And Justice for All is Metallica's most complex, ambitious work; every song is an expanded suite, with only two of the nine tracks clocking in at under six minutes.
- Steve Huey/AMG
	

â€¦And Justice for All is the fourth album by American heavy metal band Metallica. Elektra Records released the album on August 25, 1988. This is the first Metallica studio album to feature bassist Jason Newsted, since the death of the groups former bassist Cliff Burton.

The albums dark subject material, featuring references to injustice in the legal system, limited freedom, war, insanity and hate, is accompanied by what may be the most complex song structures in Metallicas discography. The album is also noted for its nearly-inaudible bass guitar and dry, sterile production, and therefore has been called a *slightly flawed masterpiece and the pinnacle of Metallicas progressive years* by AllMusic.com.

The front cover depicts the statue of Lady Justice cracked, bound by ropes, and both of her scales filled with dollars. The words *â€¦And Justice for All* are written in graffiti to the right. The cover was made by Stephen Gorman after a concept by James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich.


Reception

The album has sold over 8 million copies in the US according to the RIAA and was the best selling Metallica record upon its release. Metallica released four singles, *Eye of the Beholder*, *Harvester of Sorrow*, *â€¦And Justice for All* and *One*.

...And Justice for All was Metallicas breakthrough album and reached #6 in the Billboard charts. Though it would soon be over-shadowed commercially by the bands following album (1991's Metallica), this album nevertheless confirmed Metallicas large-scale arena status.

The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance in 1989, but with much controversy, it lost to Jethro Tulls Crest of a Knave. In 2007, the win was named one of the 10 biggest upsets in Grammy history by Entertainment Weekly.

In 1990, *One* received the first-ever Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance, Metallica's first Grammy Award. The guitar solo of *One* was ranked #7 in Guitar Worlds compilation of the 100 Greatest Guitar Solos of all time.

The album was ranked at number nine in IGNs Top 25 Metal Albums. The album is featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

Metallica released their first music video for *One,* after years of resisting pressure to release videos for their tracks. The video incited controversy among their fans, who had valued the bands apparent opposition to MTV and other forms of mainstream commercial metal. *One* entered the Top 40 on March 25, 1989 at #35.
