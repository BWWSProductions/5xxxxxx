On the eve of national elections in the Indian 
village of Peepli, two poor farmers, Natha and 
Budhia, face losing their land over an unpaid  
government loan. Desperate, they seek help from
an apathetic local politician, who suggests    
they commit suicide to benefit from a governmen
program that aids the families of indebted     
deceased farmers. When a journalist overhears  
Budhia urge Natha to "do what needs to be done"
