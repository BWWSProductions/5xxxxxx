A: 2  

Sound is about the same quality as sound from a Cam or TS. A watchable copy if you've been dying to see this. Otherwise, wait for a better release. I doubt if the 1400+ versions out there are any better"
,muLineZu,2010-11-07T04:29Z,"I've seen better cams than this
A - 2
V - 5

Better wait for a decent rip..."
