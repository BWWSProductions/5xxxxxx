,MacMoney,2010-11-05T14:01Z,Subs?
,tripkip37,2010-11-05T18:45Z,Can you please tell me what the subs are ??
,nearadyn,2010-11-06T02:51Z,"@tripkip37: Sorry I forgot to list subtitles. And the site gives me an error when I try to edit this listing to add it. These disks only have english subtitles, which is mostly pointless as it only has english audio."
,kaminer,2010-11-06T04:09Z,@nearadyn the english subs are both helpful for peaple with ering problems and also for non native englih speakers who are not that well traine in english
,swampmatt,2010-12-22T01:55Z,"RE: English subs in an english movie being pointless... In addition to what has been mentioned above, you can automate translation in the text file, and change the subs to any language you want using free online websites, or any one of several utility apps out there."
,akestles,2010-12-28T09:44Z,Any chance we might finish this?
,local313talent,2011-01-07T03:34Z,"Are all the extra's included? Or some of them are stripped for size?
""Any chance we might finish this?""
Well uploader is online regularly so there shouldn't be any problem finishing this torrent, but the way it is going (50% in two months), it's not gonna happen any time soon"
,rumba7,2011-01-11T21:26Z,"Could you seed it for a bit longer?  I got half of it in just a couple of days, but there isn't anyone seeding it.  (If you're still alive and all that)"
,Happy2Share,2011-01-15T21:32Z,"Hello Nearadyn, 
Please continue to seed. We've been stuck at about 50% for a long time. We appreciate all the time and effort that you put into this, but none of us are going to enjoy this if you don't seed to completion. Thanks again!"
,nearadyn,2011-01-17T19:21Z,"I'm still here. I'm in the process of moving right now. So I won't constantly be able to seed torrents, especially during the day in Central US time. I will mostly seed overnight while I'm asleep. It will take a long time to finish this, especially on my internet, which is usually rather slow. It will eventually though. Just be patient."
,anubisEE,2011-01-30T02:53Z,Why is this download so frackin slow? I am getting like 0.1 a day. Please seed this so I can finish downloading and then I can seed. Geez I hate leachers.
,kenqks,2011-03-05T02:10Z,"nearadyn u are not uploading much, did u forward your port?"
,kenqks,2011-03-10T06:14Z,where are the uploaders?
,kaminer,2011-03-11T09:59Z,"@ swampmatt
Sorry mate but english subs for people who don't hear well or for people who don't understand english that well not having practised english conversation is very useful.

@ nearadyn 
Any chance you might seed a little more regularly? Thanks!"
,anubisEE,2011-03-19T21:30Z,What happened to all the seeders? I am stuck at 69.9%. Come on folks please seed.
,kenqks,2011-03-25T02:49Z,finally 70%
,usquebaugher,2011-04-06T23:16Z,"Seed, return please."
,usquebaugher,2011-04-08T15:07Z,"I don't understand. I cannot connect to the seed, snd some files are not downloading :("
,skeeb,2011-04-10T00:42Z,"you can't connect to the seed because he is hardly ever online.
If we had of been given fair warning that it was going to take this long I think most of us would have passed."
,usquebaugher,2011-04-10T11:27Z,"skeeb, thank you for answer. I hope that I can download it in the future.
And thanks nearadyn for this excellent collection!"
,usquebaugher,2011-07-10T16:03Z,"Please Help!
