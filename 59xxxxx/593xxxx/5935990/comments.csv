[T],teslaman,2010-11-06T04:43Z,"Oh boy, always one of you in a crowd. (rolleyes) I think I know it isn't hi-res thank you. I always picked the regular ""Video>TV shows"" section and every time I did, it got moved to the Highres section....SO I just accepted this and put it there by default now.

Your world will not end, relax!"
,djdenero,2010-11-12T22:17Z,That's fair enough. How about leaving the 720p keyword out of the titles? That's superfluous information and would spare us search results for 720p containing them. My RSS feeds used by bit torrent keep picking them up. Ruins the automatic update and download of shows. I don't think anyone needs to know what you re-encoded from.
[T],teslaman,2010-11-19T09:35Z,"Yeah, I can do that, I'll just put it in the description instead. Oddly you're the first to mention it being a problem with RSS. I guess most people just added ""HQ"" as a filter to not match with 720p, lol.

I had been doing it that way since some people were downloading the 720p rips solely because there was nothing else better than the 350mb rips. So I wanted it to show in the search results for those people as a ""hey look!"".

Plus, it being a re-encode from a HR source is important info. As that means the quality will be much better than a real-time capture to xvid in 480p. Sadly the scene rips are 1-pass real-time rips, so the quality suffers greatly at 350mb. Even a re-encode to 350mb from the 720p rip looks much better."
