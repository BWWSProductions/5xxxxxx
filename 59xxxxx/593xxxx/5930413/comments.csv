- AsteriskLogger in \f4ubcd\nirsoft\astlog.exe
- Spyware.RemPSteal in \f4ubcd\nirsoft\chromepass.exe
- Hacktool.PassReminder in \f4ubcd\nirsoft\mspass.exe
- Trojan.Gen in \f4ubcd\nirsoft\passwordfox.exe

The rest is (not an issue - right?)
- PasswordRevealer in 
\f4ubcd\nirsoft\rdpv.exe
\f4ubcd\nirsoft\pstpassword.exe
\f4ubcd\nirsoft\netpass.exe

,webuser8,2011-01-15T02:22Z,Thank you. Very useful.
,webuser8,2011-01-15T02:25Z,"P.S. to joe03,

Nirsoft (Nirsofer) tools are all clean. I use several of them with no problem.
They sometimes show as mal in virus scanners because of the way his code is compact and interacts with system and system files. But they are not problem, just overactive scanners. ;)"
[V],FalconFour,2011-01-17T02:51Z,"@Joe: Norton sucks. Note they're all in Nirsoft, which is a collection of tools. Tools not designed for home users. Norton is designed for home users. Put the two together.

p.s.: keep an eye out for v4.5 (or 5.0, not decided on that yet) soon."
