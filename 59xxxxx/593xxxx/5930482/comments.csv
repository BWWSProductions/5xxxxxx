This is a TVrip, good quality but NOT the DVDrip."

,crdeath27,2011-04-12T14:56Z,"If you want an actual DVD rip of Season 2 you can find it here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4578128

It's the first 3 seasons.  I can vouch that season 2 is a DVD, but I already had rips of seasons 1 and 3 so I didn't download them."
