Completely revised and restructured, the new edition of Transport Planning describes the evolution of transport policies and planning, linking the past with the contemporary and future debates.

A Retrospective Analysis describes the recent past and how the current situation in research and practice on transport planning has developed, including a new chapter on events since 1997, with the difficulties of finding the means to introduce the social market. The second part of the book begins with a Comparative Analysis of experience in three European countries (Germany, France and the Netherlands) and the United States. It covers both transport planning and evaluation, where different approaches have been developed in response to national policy issues and the different cultural and analytical traditions. The final part is a Prospective Analysis of the key issues facing transport planners in the twenty-first century.
