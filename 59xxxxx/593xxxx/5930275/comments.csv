,ahuizi,2011-02-16T23:29Z,Episode 20 is out of sequence... it's actually the final episode.
,glahnt,2011-06-11T22:13Z,There are several out of sequence here. The uploader is feebleminded.

,m4lvolio,2012-02-03T14:35Z,"FYI, the last three episodes are switched around. They are as follows:

- NYPD_Blue_SE04E20_Emission.Impossible_DVDrip_by.PeaTea_Engl.avi is actually episode 22 - A draining Experience

- NYPD_Blue_SE04E21_Is.Paris.Burning_DVDrip_by.PeaTea_Engl.avi is actually episode 20 - Emission Accomplished

- NYPD_Blue_SE04E22_A.Draining.Experience_DVDrip_by.PeaTea_Engl.avi is actually episode 21 - Is Paris Burning"
