,ro4eva,2010-12-17T23:12Z,"Thank you for sharing this release with us.  There is one major problem though:

The English subs included in this release are crap.  They are not properly synced for the frame rate of this release, they are only the foreign spoken parts and also the grammar isn't very good.

So after looking around everywhere and finding nothing, I decided to release proper English subs for the 3 languages spoken in the film (English, German and Japanese).

I've released 2 versions of my subs.  One is synced to this release (25fps) and the other is synced to the film's original frame rate (24fps).

After downloading this release and realizing that it has been speed up to the European standard frame rate (25fps), I converted it back to the intended/original frame rate (24fps) as I do with all my films which I find are not 24fps after I download them.  At first I did not have a 25fps version of this film's subs, but decided to create them so that everyone watching this release will actually understand what's going on more than half of the time.  Enjoy :-)

ro4eva's subs are amazing, thanks!"
,ilsardu,2011-02-02T01:20Z,"Great seeding guys, 1.5 mb + for the most part"
,Klebacher,2011-03-07T18:19Z,Awesome seeding!! Topped out at 3.4MB/s-- I didn't even know that shit was possible!!
,yurifv,2011-04-25T01:56Z,"I think you should be ashamed, I download this and when I saw the portuguese subtitles it was in spanish. Why do everyone think that brazilians speak spanish?! go learn somethink, you retarded asses --"
,ro4eva,2011-05-02T22:06Z,"For anyone who cares,

I've decided to work on editing/fixing (spelling errors, grammar, timing, etc.) my subs because after taking a close look at them, I feel they need A LOT of work.  I'll also make a version for only the foreign dialogue. Once I'm done I'll post links again to the new subs.  Should be by the latest the end of this week."
,ro4eva,2011-05-05T03:33Z,"New and much improved subs are finally completed.

There are 4 versions.  

If you're not sure which one to download, download #2 if you want full English & Foreign subs or #4 if you want just Foreign subs.

Version #1 and #3 have been created for users who have converted the film back to its native 24FPS framerate.

These subs are a huge improvement on the first ones so DL them if you want and enjoy :-)"
,flatusgass,2011-05-15T15:27Z,"Not even a single ""Thank You"" for ro4eva???

What a bunch of mindless, selfish, idiotic assholes.

Thanks man.

But if the subs are not perfect, I am going to find you, and make you pay dearly. I swear by all that is holy, if one single word is out of sync, or one translation is wrong, I am going to make you eat my stool. Several times!"
,ro4eva,2011-05-15T20:05Z,"Just like in the movie huh?

Okay thanks for letting me know."
,flatusgass,2011-05-16T11:48Z,:-)
,ro4eva,2011-05-17T17:29Z,"You're welcome.

I apologize if I missed anything."
,flatusgass,2011-05-24T18:50Z,"Your subs rocked, kind sir. Your diligent work has spared you the cruel fate which awaited you, had then been ""sub"" par. But I am not here to pun, but rather, thank thee for your commendable subs. They were so sublime I printed them out, and ate them, with a lovely Hollandaise, and then later with a side of chipotle dipping sauce.

The film, however, was not as inspiring to the palette, the mind, or the bowels."
,ro4eva,2011-07-08T16:42Z,^^^ ROFL
