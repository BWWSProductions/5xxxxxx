,fa321654,2010-11-10T20:57Z,"I downloaded it and then I noticed that I had to use hj splitter? Is dat possible? Any way, when hj splitter was ready, I got a file which i opened with winrar. I then got an iso, but when i wanted to extract the iso, it kept asking for the next rar file, r001. What should I do?"
