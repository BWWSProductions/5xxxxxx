,iwgachi,2010-11-06T17:00Z,How about the audio quality and the a/v sync ? 
,reggeatonstyle,2010-11-06T21:34Z,waar kan je de subs alleen vandaan halen? thanks

,how2b,2010-11-17T14:06Z,"Write in English, you idiots. "
,ozric666,2010-11-24T00:04Z,"@how2b
just because you can only speak in one language doesn't make those who want to speak in their native language idiots. if you think like that you must be american if not you should be. 
as for the movie i will DL it when someone can tell me the A/V quality.
p.s. How2b you could cut and paste the text then use a translator to find out what they said, i dont speak dutch but i worked it out that way"
,Windrider1345,2010-11-27T21:57Z,@ozric666 Actually if someone can write English and decides to write in Dutch to cater to 1% of this sites viewers than that person is an idiot.  Open up a business with that attitude and watch how fast you will fail. 
,Cyali,2010-12-02T09:38Z,"Actually, anyone who thinks that insulting others over the internet is ok is really just insulting himself. Grow up kiddies.

@Ozric, that's not fair to say he must be American merely because he made an ignorant comment. Not all Americans are like that, and you're stooping to his level of ignorance by believing stereotypes."
,lastmoron,2010-12-04T10:55Z,the girl kills everyone at the end and takes the baby.
,Too_Fun,2010-12-09T19:38Z,The comment above me should be deleted and the one who post it should be banned.
,Misterkriskooper,2010-12-10T05:06Z,"""just because you can only speak in one language doesn't make those who want to speak in their native language idiots. if you think like that you must be american if not you should be.""

Stereotyping a group of people (especially the most diverse country in the world) as ignorant to other cultures shows how deep your thinking is.

Copys too crappy for me"
,cockroach000,2010-12-10T19:04Z,FYI @how2b that understands only English and expects everyone else to write for him is just envious of the European way where we speak several languages. People that speaks less than 2 are considered mentally inferior. 
,ovi2wise,2010-12-12T10:30Z,the comment section is not made for complaints against other users... thats why there is a report link. stop conflicting and please tell me the quality of this torrent
,Cyali,2010-12-12T15:24Z,"Quality's pretty decent for a theatre rip. Sound was a little bit quiet, but it sure beats paying to see it in a theatre ;) Once or twice someone stood up in front of the camera, but it wasn't a major distraction. Overall, definitely worth the download."
,ovi2wise,2010-12-27T13:25Z,"yup, i couldnt agree with you more, i watched it and it worked fine, scary movie but it wasnt as good as the first one, i actually had to go google just to make sure the movie was fictional lol, either than that i say

A: 8
V:8"
