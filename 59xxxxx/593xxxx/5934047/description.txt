Hello Party People!

This is a collection of videos from the liquid conference, Chicago, 2010.

Notes:

* Some vids are sideways cuz I thought it'd better frame the dancers.
* There were times that I had to cut the vid short cuz of lack of memory or lack of battery.  :P
* There were times I cut the video short because someone else with an awesome camera was standing right next to me getting the exact same shot, & I figured I'd save my juice & memory.

Lastly, the conference was a fucking blast.  Enjoy the footage and please keep seeding!
