A:8
V:6 (including the heads)

...based on cam quality"

,dontNeed2NoMyName,2010-11-14T06:24Z,I got one of those 6 months ago and I still do this so i wouldn't worry to much about it someone you told might have snitched on you that's what happened to me one of my friends got mad and called charter on me
,deanergirl66,2010-11-16T03:01Z,"use peerguardian 2, and you will not get em anymore."
,workersss,2010-11-20T21:02Z,"""one of my friends got mad and called charter on me "" 

That just doesn't add up, your friend would have to have proof and I'm pretty sure cable companies do not work that way ... though putting up a tracked torrent seems more feasible."
