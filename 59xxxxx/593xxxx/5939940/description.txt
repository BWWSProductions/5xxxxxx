A truley fantastic collection of 109 old maps covering 
every inch of the globe. Ancient maps of superior quality, 
ranging from 1.05.MB - 14.6.MB. You will be hard pressed 
to find a better free collection in one folder anywhere 
on the net. I have included 5 previews greatly reduced in 
size for your inspection. I had to reduce the size of the 
previews as most host sites will only allow up to 5MB.
Hope you like them. I found them very interesting indeed.


Sizes Range from:

1.05MB 1150 X 1476 - 14.6MB 2405 X 3900

All in jpg format.
