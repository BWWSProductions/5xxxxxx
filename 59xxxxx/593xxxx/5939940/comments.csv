It doesn't matter, really, because this is a great collection nonetheless. And two celestial bodies must be better than just one. :)

Thanks."

But i do see your point. Hope you enjoy looking at them though. Seems they had an habit of incorperating symbolism into their artwork back in the day. Like the eye of Orris on the dollar bill."

I use The old Internet Explorer 7 and till this afternoon have had no problem uploading my torrents. I upload around 10 a day. About 21 30 hrs uk time i tried several times to upload 4 different torrents to the bay and each time i get a complete white screen with the words ""could not open socket in top left hand corner. I have checked recent torrents and nobody else seems to be having a problem uploading. So i tried to log in to this forum and it would not accept my pirate bay username and password. I tried to reg and it said my email is being used by somone else. Can sombody help me with this coz its driving me mad. Thanks."
