[b]Bill Moyers - Howard Zinn Memorial Lecture: Shades of Howard Zinn: It's Okay If It's Impossible - October 29, 2010[/b]

=============================================================

The first Howard Zinn Memorial Lecture is delivered by veteran journalist, Bill Moyers:

Shades of Howard Zinn: It's Okay If It's Impossible

Citing Zinn as his inspiration, Moyers focuses on the challenges facing our democracy. He decried what he says has been a 30-year trend toward plutocracy, where the rich get richer at the expense of the average citizen.

Howard Zinn, the political activist and author who taught for 24 years in the College of Arts & Sciences political science department, died in January. The Howard Zinn Memorial Lecture is made possible by a generous gift from Alex MacDonald, Esq. (CAS'72), and Maureen A. Strafford, MD (MED'76).

Presented at Alumni Weekend on October 29, 2010.
