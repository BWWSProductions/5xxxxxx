,Baibee,2010-11-08T03:24Z,Thanks again! :)
[T],ADDdog,2010-11-08T10:02Z,"@Sketti11: they're only airing in fullscreen format for some reason, if you can get me the original widescreen raws (i've looked and found only dead torrents) then i can make widescreen versions"
,Sketti11,2010-11-10T01:44Z,If i could get it to stream from dish to my comp I would have the RAWs. I wish my DVD writer would work.
