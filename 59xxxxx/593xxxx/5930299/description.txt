Amazon review:
Dance, Dance, Dance.
Reviewer: Scott (USA)
Despite the fact that Avalon is an astounding, spectacular, words-aren't-good-enough group to begin with, this album just proves the different approaches to music Avalon is willing to go. Their message of God is clear, their music is soul diving, and their powerhouse voices are translucent..... Avalon is a band all can enjoy.
With this album they have experimented with music by remixing many favorite songs in a dance club meets trance/electronica kind of way. This album makes you want to dance because it's fun and it dives into music that has not really been tampered with too much within the Christian music industry.
With songs like "Testify To Love", "In Not Of", and "The Best Thing" it's rather hard to turn your ear with their majestic lyrics but intriguing tunes.
I recomend the album to anyone who loves to listen to up-tempo beats and outerspacial, dance-filled, flashy music.

Encoded using dbPowerAmp Music Converter using LAME encoding at 128kbps ABR, like all my MP3s. Don't be misled by the 128k label - give them a listen yourself.
