ANYWAYS do comment on the quality please..."
,badboy420,2010-11-08T17:36Z,"Quality is Ok.

contains extra unnecessary 29.8 mb Bonus Mp3 in the archive.

Not every guy who needs a Rahman soundtrack requires your favourite songs......

No offence.


""Akcent & Edward Maya - That's My Name 2009 ( LSD Extended Club)"",
""INNA - Hot"",
""Justin Bieber Feat Ludacris - Baby"",
""Rihanna - Rude Boy""

,Luciferatu,2010-11-09T06:39Z,"Uh nice try, but some of the tracks from the album are missing, and why include ""bonus"" tracks that have nothing to do with the soundtrack?  Plus these MP3's are in 128kbps.  Thanks but no thanks.  Anybody else wanna give it a try?"
,kiqass,2010-11-11T05:26Z,"I am not a regular torrent uploader.... i wanted these songs.. and had to download it from a stupid guy, and had to answer surveys to unlock the rar file... i dint want u guys to suffer the same.. so i uploaded.... never knew the bonus tracks weren't in the official soundtrack..

sorry...  "
,badboy420,2010-11-11T10:13Z,"@ kiqass 

Dont worry buddy
Its an honest mistake. 

Still i should give u +1 for uploading this cause its not to be found much on the net.

The official release is yet to come

@Luciferatu

U cant expect 320 kbps audio when it hasnt been released yet.

Its worth giving a try"

,ejose28,2010-12-23T01:17Z,where can i get a torrent for the movie???
,xXeMiLXxPL,2010-12-30T16:07Z,how do i decrypt it?
,detox2000,2010-12-31T13:09Z,is there a movie if so please upload?
,Pokler,2011-01-05T19:43Z,They should have used a song from The Rolling Stones on this. LOL!
,BritHobo,2011-01-15T01:08Z,"Missing four tracks, and those there aren't set up with the artist/album name etc, so you'll have to do that by yourself."
,rl1993,2011-05-15T15:34Z,"WTF, i mean i know this is the only good torrent for this on the site but COME ON! I wanted EVERY song from the album, you know, like it says in the description, not just some that you decided were good. And I know that you can't blame it on being a ""Too Big"" file size seeing how you found the room for ""Your Favourite Songs"". It's funny how it's missing 4 songs (Tracks 5,6,7&9), and there are exactly 4 of your shitty songs that we had no choice but to download. Poor Effort Dude."
,AxEmperor,2011-09-02T18:12Z,"@ kiqass, 
Thanks buddy. I really liked the ""Bonus Tracks"" too."
