These wad files add tickets to your Wii that tell the Wii Store that you own certain packs of DLC. Under RB2, you can see there are 2 packs here, which cover the first half of all DLC released. To get the rest, youâ€˜ll need to find the other packs: sZCE and sZDE. E will be released soon. Sometimes the install doesnâ€˜t stick properly. To make it work 100% of the time: Choose install twice, then choose uninstall, then choose install. Getting an Error is normal, and part of the installation. Also, to download properly, you need the most recent version of the Wii Shop Channel, 4.3, and entering it once to accept the EULA. You can find the .wad for that by googling it.

Enjoy...
