,crialdo,2010-11-05T16:28Z,"Thank you, didn't expect it to be out this fast. Thank you very much. "
,crialdo,2010-11-05T16:32Z,"Sorry for double posting, but could you upload or do you know a place where the server are uploaded? Thanx"
,narfdude,2010-11-05T16:49Z,"The normal server is at http://minecraft.net/download.jsp
but if you are talking about the modded one that nanoentity usually bundles with his uploads, then it's this one http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?t=23340"
,crialdo,2010-11-05T17:08Z,Thanks!
,rewinged,2010-11-05T17:42Z,"Hey, It's the first time I've encountered this problem so I'm at a complete loss. When I try to extract the files it tells me that all the .jar and .ogg files are compressed in the wrong format or something similar resulting in all the files being 0kb. I've tried with WinRar and 7zip to be sure as well as downloading the torrent twice. Any ideas? Thank you"
,IHeartBoobies,2010-11-05T17:43Z,"FYI this .7z is using LZMA2, which isn't supported by 7-Zip (4.65). Have to get a recent beta to open it."
,DJsnypa,2010-11-06T03:45Z,"Luis is just a fucking troll; this torrent is completely clean. Scanned with AVG and Kaspersky and it turned up nothing. Also it contains no suspicious files; they all seem almost exactly like every other minecraft torrent. It's just java files and sounds.

If anyone is having trouble extracting the .7z file then get the latest version of 7-zip or winRAR and everything should be fine.


Once again; there is no virus."
,DJsnypa,2010-11-06T03:47Z,Sorry about the double post but I just wanted to confirm that it's all working fine too.
,Unit431,2010-11-06T04:00Z,It doesn't contain any viruses you fucking prat. I scanned it with five different programs and they all came up clean. And the game itself works fine provided that you extract it with the latest beta version of 7zip.
,rewinged,2010-11-06T06:49Z,I'll try with the latest 7zip and let you guys know how it goes! Thank you.
,rewinged,2010-11-06T07:04Z,7zip beta 918 worked perfectly and the games runs flawlessly. Thank you for the advice!
,narfdude,2010-11-06T08:42Z,"It has no virus in it. really. unless notch turned evil and we are all part of a minecraft botnet now. sorry about using lzma2. i use that by default in most of the archives i make. here's the link to the newest winrar from tpb should you need it: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5794009/WinRAR_3.93_Final_32Bit_And_64Bit_Full__blaze69_

PS: ceiling cat is watching you, luis"

,narfdude,2010-11-07T07:43Z,"@tobu91
did you put everything in the right place?"
,Shad6x,2010-11-08T02:59Z,"tobu91

Probably you put the paste minecraft 1.2.1. on the %appdata% but didn't see the the real paste was the .minecraft. Throw the archives from 1.2.1 there. That should do it."
,ispeltz,2010-11-09T07:07Z,"torrent is clean, dont listen to luis. fucking troll asshole."
,todash1919,2010-11-09T08:09Z,"So I downloaded and opened the zip and then my computer decided to die from AIDS and I was all like ""O NOEZ IZ A VIRUZ!!!"".. But after I cleaned it up I realized it was actually from an older file... I've now installed and it runs great, just gotta redownload all my mods again.

TL;DR

No viruses. Seriously."
,corpse.,2010-11-09T09:01Z,When I try to run Minecraft.jar i get 'Could not find  the main class' error. Anyone having the same problem?
,Lucky13s,2010-11-09T22:58Z,"Doesnt extract for me. I get 207 errors while extracting.

My minecraft.jar file is 0kbs, this is wrong."
,dude2288,2010-11-09T23:44Z,"I'm trying to play this on a mac. Everything seems to be running fine but it says 'play online once to enable offline'.

I'm guessing they closed the offline loophole... anyone know how to crack this?"
,hungryman521,2010-11-10T10:09Z,"im getting the play online to enable offline error, please somebody answer, im not the first to ask what the hell the problem is."
