Here is Minecraft version 1.2.1 "vanilla". I didn't include the server or anything extra because you've probably got a lot of launchers from other uploads. 

Unzip minecraft.7z to Username\Application Data\.minecraft on Xp or Username\Appdata\Roaming\.minecraft on vista and 7. Start minecraft using a launcher or minecraft.jar. Login with empty credentials and click play offline.

I will seed until a new update comes out.
