,Lama43,2010-11-06T02:10Z,"It seems that some arc files are corrupt due to a bad header. Strange I would've expect the orginal RAR to spit out errors.

Anyone else got this problem?"

,crazyman1,2010-11-15T15:08Z,"@vaibhav03 
dude forget this. it showed some errors during installation 4 or 5 times and i could not start the campagin at first, but then at my 5th or 6th attempt i was able to start the campaign and right now i am at 3rd level but i am sure it wont work after some time coz some levels are not fully decompressed and i believe level.arc is corrupted, so dude try downloading ISO if u can."
,vaibhav03,2010-11-15T16:39Z,"@crazyman1

,crazyman1,2010-11-15T17:40Z,"@crazyman1
ya, but globe rips never worked for me and this is the first TPTB rip that did not work for me...at least partially..."
,cots,2010-11-16T05:33Z,i can confirm this works finished the game already 
,Shoobox,2010-11-18T05:11Z,"lol every rippper has a favorite,
its a personal choice,
 for me globe rips lately are sh!t.
some games are only 5.7 to 6.3gb in size and he still rips out the movies files and screws them up.
a 5.7 game file  can be high compressed to 4.7gb easily, but he still takes the hard aproach.
I've found TPTB rips to have worked flawlessly for me.
  Most faults are because people do not understand free arc,
if you running on lower memory than ""2gigs"" use Peazip its realtime unzipper, faster than freearc and you have real time control over your zipped files."
,Shoobox,2010-11-18T05:18Z,"This is globe on youtube would you really wanna trust him on rips?

,Kiura,2010-11-19T13:07Z,"Something is wrong with decompressing, you have to do it manually .."
,Shoobox,2010-11-25T20:28Z,"privador
use peazip to open and extract from .rar file or preferred archiver

then run the setup.batch, follow the instructions it takes time to once in batch is extracting,
make sure you have plenty of free space, the setup batch will inzip the levels arc file you have to be patient."
,subzeroscorpion,2010-12-10T10:48Z,"hey shroo!!!....wud u care to upload frontlines:fuels of war???...if u can then let me know .....
and james bond works perfectly..thanks"
,dardar6t9,2010-12-13T04:48Z,Seems like the last few TPTB uploads are failing a lot of ppl.....I was really happy with your posts until I did Black Ops.....waste of bandwidth. I wait till the end of the month and use up the last of my 120gb......but that doesn't change the fact that now I have 5gb of memory that's useless for anything....Have asked and gotten no reply from your team. Screw it. I'm going for a ride on the Harley....at least that wont let me down.
,vgvgvg7412,2011-01-04T06:37Z,"Works Gr8. Thanks a ton :)
