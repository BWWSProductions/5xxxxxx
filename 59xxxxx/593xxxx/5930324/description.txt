IF YOU LIKE IT, BUY IT!!!!

This is the music from the much loved Mentos+Coke videos by EepyBird.com. Truly excellent music in this album. My favorites are Control Room (O6 Mix), In The Now, and of course, You Gotta Tap (from the original video). The artist of this album isn't from a big record label, so please, if you like the music, go to the site and buy the darn CD. I did. http://www.AudioBody.com
