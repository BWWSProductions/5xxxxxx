       Five friends break into a closed corn maze in the middle of the    
       night and decide to play a harmless game of tag. Little do they    
       know that a psychopathic killer has decided to play along. As they  
       wander aimlessly through the maze the murderer follows closely     
       behind, taunting them and watching their every move. The game      
       turns deadly when the kids decide to separate and weaken their     
       chances of survival. When the mutilated body of the maze owner is   
       found they realize that something is terribly wrong. As they race   
       to find the entrance of the maze, the murderer cleverly forces     
       them to follow the path that he wants. Manipulating everyone to    
       his vicious will, the killer taunts his victims and leads them     
       further into the depths of the maze. After succumbing to hours of   
       torture will anyone make it out of the maze...alive?
