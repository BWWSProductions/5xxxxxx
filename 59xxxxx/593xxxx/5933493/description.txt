Based on the true story of the world's best-love hymn and the slaves that inspired it.

John Newton is captain of a slave ship moored off the coast of Nigeria. He stands at a crossroad in his life, his morality and religion at odds with the brutality of his chosen profession. Stepping ashore, he starts on a journey of redemption that will end in tragedy but proves the catalyst for greater achievements. A local anthem sung in adversity by the slaves he captures punctuates the film. It will be the inspiration for John Newtonâ€™s redemption, and, years later, for his writing of the worldâ€™s most enduring hymn, Amazing Grace.
