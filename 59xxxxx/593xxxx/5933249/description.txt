Modern Marvels: Night

Some activities only occur when the world is dark. Stay up late off the coast of California to hunt squid by the tens of thousands. Visit Toronto, Canada where an army of pickers pluck countless night crawlers emerging from their burrows. In Tennessee,capture the action as military trainees try their hand at the latest night vision gear. And experience how hard it is to evade a police helicopter's spotlight, or powerful noses and sharp teeth when the cops deploy their K-9 units. For some after hours fun, see how more than six hundred, 2,000 watt lights can turn night into day inside the Pittsburgh Pirates' new state-of-the-art stadium.
