,TonyKrew,2010-11-10T04:10Z,Could I update the software and then replace the file again and register any name after updating? Or will that make the crack pointless at that point...
,tttgroup,2010-11-10T13:58Z,I have also tried this one as well still giving me invalid serial.We need some new cracks as it looks like they are a head of us..
,PawnSacrifice,2011-01-10T19:34Z,"Works great. 

As he said, after you've installed the crack register with any name and number and it gives you the full version. 

After installing and before using the crack I would go into options and turn off any auto updating. "
,newbie700,2011-01-19T10:52Z,"Thank you very much.  
As previously mentioned replacing the .dll file I was able to reg whatever name and number I wanted.  I too turned off auto updates just in case. 
So far so good.
Thanks again."
,ashpool1,2011-01-20T00:56Z,I installed your crack and the program still comes back unregistered.  Is that how its suppose to be?
,ashpool1,2011-01-20T01:00Z,"Oh, forget that question.  U just go into help to register the program.  Thx"
,Sir_Psycho_Sexy,2011-01-26T03:36Z,"Great download man, thanks. But, I used this program for a couple days just fine but now it is its unregistered. I've tried UI & RI but that didn't seem to work. Any suggestions?"

,rhcp182,2011-03-05T09:29Z,"El programa funciona muy bien, gracias por el torrent, buen trabajo ;)."
,stargateanubis14,2011-03-18T17:59Z,"when i copy the crack to the directory, the program fails to load, and hangs when loading FWPUCLNT.DLL, and eventually crashes.
Running 64-bit win 7.

However, that is only when using the download from the site. You MUST use the installer from the torrent to correctly launch"
,stargateanubis14,2011-03-18T19:52Z,"::USE AT OWN RISK::

I have been running my machine for some time, and not 5 minutes after installing/using this, my website was hacked (ftp hack). I was working on some basic site maintenance, and suddenly, it was all deleted, and replaced by a site ""H4CK3D_by_Xcrypt0_files"".

again...

USE AT OWN RISK"
,vivatpb5776,2011-04-09T22:15Z,"The download was quick, obviously. Installed with no issue. I copied the .dll file into the appropriate location and opened the app. The version was, as mentioned, 6.0.12.1105. I registered the app and a few moments later, I was prompted to update the app to the latest version. Completed the download/install of the latest version but now the application is unregistered.

For shits and giggles, I tried to copy the original .dll file back into the program file folder location. Once I attempted to open the application, the progress failed at the same place stargateanubis14 referenced in his or her post.

Thanks for the upload but it's worthless if you cannot update the application. I use Version 5 with no issue and the ability to update the application. Until someone comes up with a crack of the LATEST version that allows for registered use AND updates, I will stick with version 5."

,espanold,2011-06-06T23:59Z,"Hey, what do they mean by ""Replace the file(s) in the crack with the original file(s) in directry [C:\Program Files\ImTOO\DVD Ripper Ultimate 6]""

i tried deleting the file in the crack folder and copying the setup.exe file into the crack folder. i tried dragging the ""crack"" file into the setup.exe file. neither one of those things worked. thanks for the help. "
,minimaggot101,2011-11-15T02:04Z,had the same problem as espanold
