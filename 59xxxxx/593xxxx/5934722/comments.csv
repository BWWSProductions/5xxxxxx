[V],Kuthumi,2010-11-05T08:11Z,"Correct title and filename for this should be:
Hole in One (2010) Norsubs
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1263800
It has nothing to do with the American Pie series."
,thomaslio,2010-11-05T16:38Z,"Sure? Because this cover tells me ""American pie plays golf"" ;) http://images.planetf1.com/10/09/800x600/hole800_2502254.jpg"
,thomaslio,2010-11-05T16:42Z,"Hello Kuthumi, 
If you open you link, and see on the picture. Look down on the picture(cover). There it stands ""American Pie Plays Golf"" 
Maybe it has nothing to do with the series, but it is an american pie movie
Do also look on the trailer of this movie http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBaGGiLqdFI"
