,natjo,2010-11-09T19:34Z,That's why I put this in the FLAC section. If I was uploading MP3 I wouldn't have put it in the FLAC section. Also. I like FLAC because I can convert to formats in which I prefer. For instance: 192 VBR MP3 is my preferred format. I'm not gonna download a lossy 320 Kbps CBR and convert from lossy format to lossy format.
