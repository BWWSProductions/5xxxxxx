European contemporary jazz with a real avant garde twist. The Marguet, KÃ¼hn,
Monniot, Boisseau Quartet (MKMB) is a perfect example of a European
understanding (with three French musicians, one German, and a Hungarian label);
of intergenerational understanding (with the â€œpapaâ€ Joachim KÃ¼hn and three
partners young enough to be his sons) and an example of musical understanding
based on the cohabitation of Afro-American jazz branded with freedom, like that
of Ornette Coleman, and notated European music going from J.S. Bach through
Messiaen, to the Viennese twelve-tone composers and BartÃ³k.
