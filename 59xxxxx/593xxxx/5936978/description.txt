S02E01 - Japan -
 
Merrilees Parker travels to the island state of Japan to learn about its unique food culture. Starting in its capital Tokyo, she goes to, Tsukiji, the world's biggest fish market, where she encounters weird shellfish and 500lb tuna! Master chef, Romeo teaches her how to make the ultimate sushi, an art that takes years to master. Then it's off to a ramen museum, where you can try regional styles of the noodle soup that is Japan's fast food of choice. Although the Japanese have one of the healthiest diets on the planet, many of their ingredients are alien to the average westerner. Merrilees meets Elizabeth Andoh, a food writer who guides her round the unfamiliar ingredients of a Tokyo food hall such as miso and seaweed.

Escaping the city, Merrilees takes the bullet train to Matsusaka where she visits a farm that produces the most expensive beef in the world - the cows are fed with apples and beer and massaged daily! On to Kyoto, the old seat of the empire where she's immersed in traditional Japanese customs such as the tea ceremony and visits a 400-year-old restaurant. After shopping in its ancient market, known as Kyoto's Kitchen, she learns about the Japanese art of knife-crafting. Soba noodles and tofu are other Japanese staples - Merrilees visits another ancient restaurant to try these before meeting the master brewer of a local sake brewery - a Brit! After a quick look at the ancient practice of comorant fishing, Merrilees travels to Japan's iconic Mount Fuji for the annual Summer Fire Festival to gorge herself on wonderful street food.

Back in the suburbs of Tokyo, Merrilees is invited to the home of a lady who teaches her how to make tempura - an invite to a private home is an honour in Japan and the food is even better! Then Merrilees watches the preparation of fugu - the ultimate Japanese food fetish - a poisonous fish which can kill if prepared in the wrong way before ending her journey with a lesson in Japanese/European fusion cuisine.
