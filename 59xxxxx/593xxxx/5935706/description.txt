IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:used The Russian dvdr......Thanks ELEKTRI4KA
AUDIO:LAP .......Thanks

Right here we are running late again with this one... anyway we used laps audio as it was the best out Thanks LAP used the russian dvdr. Now once again the r5 dvdr was poor by the normal standard so we think. It was way too dark and colours too strong and also off. Anyway we made a script to fix the colours the best we could and also made it alot brighter... roughly + 10 on brightness alone + we added our normal resize, white balance etc..

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
