Description:

iPhoto Library Manager... Apple's iPhoto is a convenient application to use to organize and edit your digital photos, but it restricts you to having to keep all of your photos in a single, monolithic library. iPhoto Library Manager adds an additional level of control over your iPhoto collection by allowing you to keep your photos in multiple libraries and transfer them back and forth without losing your keywords, ratings, and all the other information you've worked to assign to your photos.

Libraries can be split into smaller ones, or smaller libraries can be merged together into one large library. You can keep your photos on an external drive or another computer on your network, share them with other users on your machine, sync them all with your iPod, and use iPhoto Library Manager to keep track of it all.
