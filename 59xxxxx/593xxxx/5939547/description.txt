Herein lies a wonderful modern Viola Concerto by Alfred Schnittke. Indeed, he claimed that he recovered from a near-fatal stroke so he could compose this piece.

Also included is Concerto Grosso no. 2, from the same CD


Performers:
* Yuri Bashmet, viola
* Oleg Kagan, violin
* Natalia Gutman, cello 
* The USSR Ministry of Culture Symphony Orchestra (Rozhdestvensky)






Encoded in FLAC compression-level 5.


**Tagging is done as follows:
Artist == Composer
Album == Name of the work
Title == Title of a part or movement in a work
Genre == The performer(s)
Track == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.

I've done filenames as "%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title"


If there are any skips or pops in the files that I have missed, please comment and I will fix and upload that piece.
