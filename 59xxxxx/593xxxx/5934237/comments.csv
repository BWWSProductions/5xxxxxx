Oh yeah - really awesome movie!"
,upstreamftw,2010-11-27T19:36Z,Gotta love how people claim shit is a DVD rip when its still in theaters... Even if you were to get an  early leak wouldnt be as shit quality as 99% of them are on here. Great movie but ppl really need to learn to fuckin label shit properly bc this isnt a DVD rip.. fuckin dumb apes
