""No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it""

Any ideas on how to get this going?"
,bookworm1960,2010-11-06T23:26Z,@nac30 - Are you going to seed this or is this an orphan?
,nac30,2010-11-07T02:41Z,"Since when does ""[s]eeding work[...] immediately if DHT and Peer Exchange is enabled/working""? I have downloaded plenty here on TPB were I had to wait quite some time until any transfer started. I am seeding everything I ever uploaded and will keep doing it as long as there are peers interested in them.

@DigieraMandela: I must have missed something in bookworm1960's question!? How does lazyman333 come up?

@bookworm1960: OpenBittorent seems to be up and down, though more often down than up lately. I added multiple trackers - not every client supports DHT, peer exchange or local peer discovery. Some trackers will die, some will stick around for a while... But it's true that I've let too many trackers in my list (TPB trackers are dead and Demonoid requires registering the torrents which acc. to its rules won't work for this)."
,bookworm1960,2010-11-07T06:45Z,"The starting of seeding normally begins within 30 minutes of posting, this is the first time that I have ever seen a torrent take 5 hours before it started seeding.
So yeah, it kind of bugged me.

And, though I haven't posted any torrents here on TPB, I always try to seed back to a ratio of 5 or better."
