"Pasadena"

After a pregnant Rebecca Townley (guest star 
Rebecca Mader, "Lost") is found run over and 
left for dead, the detectives learn that the 
baby's father may be a married politician, and 
the crime a homicide. As Winters and Jaruszalski 
begin digging deeper into her past, they are led 
to a young couple, Adam (guest star Rob 
Benedict) and Carolyn Yarborough (guest star 
Karis Campbell), who seem to know more than they 
are willing to tell when it comes to Rebecca. 
DDA Morales (Alfred Molina) must weave carefully 
through a political minefield as he begins the 
task of uncovering the truth.

Enjoy :)
