,Cerebral222,2010-11-08T12:28Z,"Thanks for the upload RecycleBin32. This exe expands to over 2 gig (The full game) works on windows 7 32 & 64 bit even though at the end of the install on the 64 bit OS a message states that the game is not compatible, I just changed the compatibility to windows xp (service pack 3), worked perfectly, no bugs."
