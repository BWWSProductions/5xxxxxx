The disc is a live set of a show put on by teranoid (kors k) and a few other guest artists. Being live, you can hear the crowd, and whoever is hosting throws some occasional crowd-pumping commentary over the tracks. It certainly sounds like one hell of a show, I would have loved to have been there. Most of these tracks are available on teranoid & MC Natsack's other albums, Teranoid Overground Edition, Teranoid Underground Edition, and Teranoid Overground Edition 1.04. As far as a favorite track, that's easy, "Pumpin Rabbit Express - full sizeversion", 4:35-5:00 is one of the most fun buildups I've ever heard in a track. Download the album, each track stands by itself despite being a live set, and have a good time.

"skip2the..." and "Skip to Skip" are the other highlights.
