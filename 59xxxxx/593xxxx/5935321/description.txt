"The Bones That Weren't"

After the skull of a promising young dancer 
is found lodged in concrete at a construction 
site, the team must first figure out what 
happened to the victim's skeletal structure. 
After learning the victim quit ballet to 
pursue hip hop, Booth and Brennan uncover 
another layer of evidence that points them to 
a suspect who had a secret relationship with 
the victim. Meanwhile, when Hannah (guest 
star Winnick) is put on assignment in a dodgy 
part of town, her safety is jeopardized and 
her life is put in critical danger.

Enjoy :)
