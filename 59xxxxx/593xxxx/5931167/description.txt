"Goodbye to You" is a new wave single and song by the 1980s band Scandal.

The song was written by band member Zack Smith. It appeared on Scandal's 1982 Scandal EP. The song was also released as a single, and reached #65 on the Billboard Hot 100.

The video shows Scandal keyboardist Benjy King playing a rare Digital Keyboards Synergy synthesizer, which provided the main 8th note foundation of the track, and also features Late Show with David Letterman's bandleader and sidekick Paul Shaffer playing a solo -- based on Del Shannon's "Runaway" on an Oberheim OB-Xa.

Scandal is a self-titled, 5-song EP by the band Scandal, released in 1982 by Columbia Records. Although the EP has never been released on CD, all five songs are found on the VH1 Scandal compilation CD called We Are The '80s. The EP's album cover photo of the five band members is also reproduced on the VH1 compilation's cover (with an updated photograph). The song "Win Some, Lose Some" was written in 1979 and first recorded by Bryan Adams on his self-titled 1980 debut.

Scandal is a rock band from the 1980s fronted by Patty Smyth. The band scored a hit in the US with the song "The Warrior", which peaked at #7 in 1984. Their other major hits were "Goodbye to You" (1982 - #65 US), "Love's Got A Line On You" (1983 - #59 US), and "Hands Tied" (1984 - #41 US).

Patty Smyth (born June 26, 1957, New York) is an American rock and roll musician. She first enjoyed mainstream success in 1982 as lead singer of the band Scandal. That band's self-titled debut release became Columbia Records' biggest selling EP.

Scandal was formed in New York City in 1981 by guitarist Zack Smith, who also wrote most of the band's hits. The other initial members included: bassist Ivan Elias (1950â€“1995), guitarist Keith Mack, guitarist Jon Bon Jovi (briefly), keyboardist Benjy King, drummer Frankie LaRocka, and vocalist Patty Smyth. Thommy Price later replaced LaRocka on drums.

The band had much success early on but due to struggles within the group and their record company, it slowly dissolvedâ€”losing member after member. By the time "The Warrior" tour hit the road in 1984, all that remained of the original lineup were Smyth and Mack. Scandal broke up shortly after the tour ended. The group (minus Ivan Elias, who died of cancer in June 1995) reunited in 2004 for VH1's Bands Reunited show and did a string of concerts on the United States East Coast culminating in a show at Irving Plaza in their home city (New York) on February 9, 2005. During the summer of 2006, the band (excluding Thommy Price) reunited again for VH1's "We Are The 80's" tour, playing a string of large - mainly outdoor - venues and earning critical acclaim. During the summer and fall of 2007, they toured again (this time without Zack Smith).

In July 2008, Billboard reported the upcoming release of new music by Patty Smyth and Scandal (featuring original members Keith Mack and Benjy King). At a performance in Dewey Beach, DE on August 3, 2008, Smyth indicated Scandal would be releasing a new five song EP in the near future. Scandal also performed one of their new songs, "Trust In Me". Other new titles include "Make It Hard" and "End Of The Girl". Patty Smyth & Scandal debuted their first single as a band ("Hard For You To Love Me", also referred to as "Make It Hard") in over 24 years on January 17, 2009 in Ridgefield, CT to a standing ovation. Patty Smyth stated the song will be available to purchase digitally in February 2009, with the new EP to follow shortly. However, the single has been delayed to 2010 as the EP will expanded to a full length album according to Patty Smyth's blog in May 2009.
