BAD ACTING GUYS!!!!
fights are ok
but the acting sucks balls!"
,JLT303,2010-11-10T07:31Z,I watched the first fifteen minutes of this movie but I'll need a lobotomy before I watch the rest.  Good quality upload A-9 V-9 but definitely not worth your bandwidth--these idiots should stick to hitting each other and leave the acting to others.
,stevearno,2010-11-11T00:20Z,"good quality .....

but this movie is sh!t ..... i disagree the fighting is gay the acting even worse ...avoid like herpes "

need more seeder tho took 24 mins to download when normally takes about 5 10 mins for me but never the less thanks :)"
,Amea81,2010-11-23T12:15Z,"Quality is pretty great for a 698mb.
The movie is medioker at best with a B-list feel to it, but the fights are good:)"
,El-Quinto,2010-11-24T11:17Z,"in the genre ""illegal prison cagefighting"" there's better. Like ""blood and bone"" and ""undisputed 2"" (unlike undisputed 1 this is about kickboxing).

The acting in this flick was bad and the fighting mediocre. 
Also, there should've been more kimbo; he only fights once and it is a kinda boring fight which does not have a function in the plot whatsoever.

It is still a fun movie to watch though :)"
,mcjiralo,2010-11-28T19:39Z,thanks
,bigbenwallace90,2010-11-29T17:00Z,"virus detected using norton 360, so i tryed again this time only downloading the movie no other files and still says virus detected. reading the other comments, lot of bad reviews so ill pass on this"

Very, very bad acting.
After 3 minutes you know is a waste of time.
I have to say it, sorry dudes.... when they organize one fight in the prision, which are ""oficially supported"" they write it down in a small paper to make run the notice and deliver it to anotice all the prisioners about it..... was so hilarious"
,The_Digital_Pirate,2010-12-03T12:03Z,"Not worth the space on my Drive...This P.O.S. Is as bad as that bullshit Snow Blind that wa up last week or so. Low Budg ass hell...All the money went to the only really known actor...Cliche ass movie, Terrible Music, RIffs and horrible Hip hop and Rapcore cessy-ness...Mos Def Avoid"
,jm413d,2011-01-10T03:00Z,"Too bad most of the people in this aren't actors... They're professional UFC fighters... So poor acting skills would be expected.

Rip Quality:
Audio - 9
Video - 9
Movie - 8.5

Please keep your opinions about acting skills to yourselves. We'll find out on our own, thanks. "
,raidensolid,2011-03-23T12:41Z,Softwarez is such an asshole!!! but thanx i'll download this one..tnx
