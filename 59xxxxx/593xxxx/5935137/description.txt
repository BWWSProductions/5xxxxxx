On the eve of national elections in the Indian  
village of Peepli, two poor farmers, Natha and  
Budhia, face losing their land over an unpaid   
government loan. Desperate, they seek help from 
an apathetic local politician, who suggests     
they commit suicide to benefit from a government
program that aids the families of indebted      
deceased farmers. When a journalist overhears   
Budhia urge Natha to "do what needs to be done"
