I downloaded the first track, Band On The Run and compared it to my standard version encoded at 44100@320 CBR. My version sounded better. The joint stereo setting messed up the guitar stereo effect. The audio quality was better on my version than this. My total file size for the 9 track album was the same for the 2 CD's listed here.

VBR is only used for broadcasting or streaming. Joint stereo was developed for internet streaming for dial up internet. Joint stereo never made the standards and was ditched because of broadband. The settings of 44100@256/320 CBR comes from the standards. Using VBR and Joint Stereo is from 1995, it is now 2011."
