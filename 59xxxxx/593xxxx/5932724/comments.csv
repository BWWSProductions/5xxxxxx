,sirroom,2010-11-06T10:21Z,Thanks for the help raster68! XD

Disc 3 & 4 ??????"
,LTD602,2011-02-08T15:04Z,"What a shame.

The rip doesn't play correctly. Seems the m2ts files are in the wrong order. Keeps jumping back to previous scenes, fast-forwarding on its own after a scene change, etc. Unless you're watching the blu ray original, there's no way to order the scenes correctly. Maybe they can be joined somehow?

VLC doesn't play it correctly, nor my WD Live Plus HD media player. It plays other direct Blu ray rips just fine. 

Oh well. I certainly appreciate the effort of the uploader, though."
,sirroom,2011-02-12T06:29Z,"Unfortunately, this is the way the disc(s) were authored by 20th Century Fox. Try playing via the playlist file(s). "
,LTD602,2011-02-16T23:28Z,"sirroom:

No worries, I appreciate the upload. Must have taken quite a while. I can always find a way to join the files. At least we all have access to the full disc, thanks to you."
