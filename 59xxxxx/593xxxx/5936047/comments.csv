Uninstall your jeppview 3.5 program disc, then after that install it again, but before you install the latest update, download first cycle 01-2009 (you can download it here in piratebay).  When finished with the download, install it..... (so you can register jeppview using R00D-KCAB), after successfully registering jeppview, then you can install the latest update."
