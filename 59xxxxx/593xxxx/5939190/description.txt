Here is some of the most sought after Swedishpressed EPÂ´s by recordcollectors worldwide.
All are very rare to say the least. See the front cover for an estimated value for these in Mint condition.

There are a few more that did not made it to this CD ( no more space ) so they will eventually be on a volume two in the future. It is all up to you to comment if that sounds interesting.

Note: when you burn this CD ( in Nero ) be sure that the box " normalize all audio files " is checked.
You will get an more even level in the tunes that way. ( Some of these old vinyls are low and some are high in sound. )

If it donÂ´t show I am seeding thatÂ´s just because of my IP blocker. Will seed Â´til I see this is going by itself then I delete it from my computer. So keep seeding to keep it alive. 

Rock on!
