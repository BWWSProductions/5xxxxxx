Rock sensations Good Charlotte are back with their highly anticipated fifth full-length album Cardiology almost exactly 10 years after their self-titled debut put them on the map as one of the most exciting bands of the decade. Originally formed as a pop-punk band in Waldorf, Maryland, in 1996, Good Charlotteâ€”vocalist Joel Madden, guitarist Benji Madden, guitarist Billy Martin, bassist Paul Thomas and the latest edition, drummer Dean Butterworthâ€”have penned countless mainstream radio hits such as â€œThe Anthem,â€ â€œLifestyles of the Rich & Famousâ€ and â€œHold On.â€ However more importantly the band have constantly reinvented themselves and refused to limit their potential, whether that means supporting Justin Timberlake on his FutureSex/LoveShow tour or collaborating with Avenged Sevenfold's M. Shadows and Synyster Gates on their hit single â€œThe Riverâ€ from Good Charlotteâ€™s 2007 full-length Good Morning Revival. That adventurous musical persona continues with Cardiology, an album that features everything from the dance floor-friendly first single â€œLike Itâ€™s Her Birthdayâ€ to future GC anthems such as â€œSilver Screen Romance,â€ while still effortlessly retaining the bandâ€™s signature sound in the process. While in some ways Cardiology is a return to form for these multiple Warped Tour headliners, it also manages to work in elements from throughout the band's classic catalog to create an album that simultaneously summarizes what Good Charlotte are all about and hints at where they are headed in the future. While musical trends can be fleeting, Good Charlotte have always proved themselves to be a constant in the music world by sticking to their punk roots without being afraid to expand their horizons and bring in new influencesâ€”and Cardiology is just the latest chapter in the band's already unparalleled career. We canâ€™t wait to see what the second decade holds in store with Good Charlotte and share Cardiology with the bandâ€™s myriad fans and supporters who have been clamoring for this record.
