2001 Little Black Book    CD  Do-Little DO 009CD 

Definitely one of those little treasures you stumble across and want to tell the world about. Understated, intelligent, intriguing... What - or who - is Nikki Racklin singing about? Gorgeous layers of guitars from Sam Johnson. Dreamy sounds, music to fantasise to... Quality stuff. Check it out!!!
