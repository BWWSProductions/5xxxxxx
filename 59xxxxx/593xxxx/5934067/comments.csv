I do pratical files and in this case wasnÂ´t possible after the videos work keep the voices on the videos because they was exteriorly to the videos but everything else looks normal ."

keep up the good work....

[V],globeplus,2010-11-04T18:12Z,"Thank you for your comments and i do pratical files and my intention is always keep the gameplay more complete and normal as possible , i canÂ´t throw away close 1 gb that with the correct work , have the videos ok anyway , on this case the voices was separated from the videos but with the subtitles totally correct synchronised and the picture and sound obtained very acceptable too , i do pratical files , so it is ok throw away close 1 gb that can be done with correct work in things that they pass a kind of quickly and certainly donÂ´t change anything on the gameplay ? the idea is to put everything perfect but in this case the voices on the videos was separated from the videos thatÂ´s all ... The fact of beeing more incisive explaining this , is the next thing : in one or another game with situations similars to this one i get distracted users acting like a kind of revoltated asking me on the comments things like this : - Globe , what really is ripped , is that all ? or - Why you donÂ´t explain to the possible users what things the file donÂ´t have ? or - What you mean with COMPLETE game with nothing missing , it is something ripped ? and questions like this , so i decide that is more wise from me saying everything at once insistently in this type of situation to evitate questions like this . Thank you for your comments ."

[V],globeplus,2010-11-05T17:26Z,Now i no why i am getting more negative votes than usual : it is a rip from tptb out there for this game now ... JESUS !!! This guys are terrible ...
[V],globeplus,2010-11-05T19:45Z,"To etsucks : the users can have in mind that i am thinking on them when i do the work and the intention is really keep the full game more as possible no doubt but in some situations i have to make options under the circunstances , but of course doing this things but knowing that the gameplay is not affected with that and in a few games lately i have to say that i am checking that not all the time the voices or audio are incorporated on the videos and if the video is worked correctly and with the same name the video donÂ´t work anymore with audio or the voices independtly of beeing with the same video type or having the same name , maybe can be any little trick or something for situations like this that i donÂ´t know about , but in fact , it was more recently that i assist a little increase on the percentage of games with videos in this circunstances , i promise that if i get the possibility , i will try to improve about this particular situation too but for the moment i donÂ´t have a valid ""work around"" to get the videos accepting the exteriorly audio or voices incorporated on the game videos , so i can only make the promise that if i find in anyway a way out , i certainly prefere to do more work if necessary and keep everything but in a reasonable way if it is possible of course , this is what i can call , ununexpectdly difficulties in the life of a pratical files uploader ."
[V],globeplus,2010-11-05T22:35Z,"HI !!! After my last comment i decided to start the study and research about the incorporation of exterior audio or voices on the videos when they are not integrated on the main video and the study reveals the next notes :
1 - Possible to incorporate and create a new worked video with the separated voices or audio ? Answer : YES with a small note : maybe not 100% syncronized but if not 100% , very close to that
2 - The incorporation is an easy task ? Answer : NO , it isnÂ´t , certainly it is a kind of hard work for each single video and if we are talking about a game that needs 15 or 20 videos to be worked then , it is absolutly no joking the work 
CONCLUSIONS AT THIS POINT OF THE STUDY : The incorporation can depend on the type of the videos that can be worked with this carachteristics and certainly the number of the videos and the time they are showed on the screen can influenciate a possible decision to have this exterior audio incorporated or not
FINAL NOTE : my research will continue in trying to find if it is possible any quicker way to do this type of work if it is possible the work but for the moment the point of the situation about this subject is what i refered on the conclusions . Thank you and it is a pleasure study to try to improve my work for all of you get even better files when the worked game get exterior audio on the videos but i still have to be reasonable on my decisions ."
[V],globeplus,2010-11-05T22:57Z,"HI AGAIN !!! As an example of the refered work on the last comment , i have the very first video of this game with voices incorporated for 8.4 mb for the users take a look , to use this video on the video just drag and drop or copy the included folder like it is on the game folder at the executable place and confirm the overwriting of the folder wherever is necessary and thatÂ´s it , the first video of the game will have the voices incorporated , ok here is the link and copy or write in succession the link to the address bar :

I'm a great persecutor of your torrents, I've been coming to tpb every day for the last four days to see if you had posted this torrent and finally you have!! Once again flawless, many thanks, great job... By the way let m tell you this. Fuck the guys who hate you. Yeah tptb is good, butt you're better.. Why? Cause you reduce the size so much and still the game works great.. I've read your comment a while ago on some torrent that said you're reconsidering to keep doing this type of job... Do not stop dude!!! Do not give up on us.. You and your work are our drug... You feed our gamig addictions and fill our free time with great games, with small size...

NEWS ON MY RESEARCH WORK ON THE EXTERIOR AUDIO FOR SOME TYPES OF VIEOS :

I am much better now , i think i probably reduced close 50% the necessary time to work every single video beside the fact that still some work anyway but not the end of the world but the only detail that remains beside the subtitles still synchronised and nice and very close to the audio is the precision of the audio with the picture , it is possible the 100% but happen a maximum half second i think difference between the movement on the video picture and the audio but what the hell the difference is almost nothing and certainly for this kind of time not making too much difference at the same time of the subtitles , so if in a future game this type of work is possible i can probably go for it beside the some extra work and it is a pleasure do this type of research to improve the files if it is the case for all of you get the best gameplay possible for less size as possible . Thank you and happy gaming to all of you ."

now , i really have all the picture to a few possibilitys of work with exterior audio for this type of video , fast work and very nice techniques for a little bit less size without spending much more time than the more faster work , so in similar cases in the future on the games i can handle easily and with a few nice possibilitys , the conclusion about this research is that no matter what you think you know you can always improve and this lesson is beautifull . Thank you for the support and it is a pleasure make research to improve the work to do even better files , in this case i was adaptating to a little bit more frequent style for this type of videos with the possibility of exterior audio on the videos , before this research i was uploading without the voices and it was looking tough to do something , now to me , looks very easy without not much work to incorporate the exterior audio if it is the case , so this study wasnÂ´t of course what you can call a waste of time . Happy gaming everyone and get the very easy to incorporate update now available with all the videos with english voices ."
