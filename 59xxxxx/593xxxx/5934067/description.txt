* Gameplay : [text extracted from wikipedia]*

The game is a third-person shooter with elements of hand-to-hand combat. Some elements from Quantum of Solace were removed such as the cover to cover system. There are some driving sequences. Blood Stone features a unique Focus Aim system which allows players to lock onto targets after melee takedowns, not too dissimilar to the \"Mark and Execute\" feature from Splinter Cell Conviction. There is also a multiplayer mode consisting of up to 16 players that will pit spies versus mercenaries. Alongside team deathmatch and other standard game modes there are massive objective-based battles where players have to work as a team to attack or defend various spy-themed goals. It has also been announced that players will pilot a number of vehicle types throughout the course of the game.
