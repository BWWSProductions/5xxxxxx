As you all have noticed that I added 3 extra features that the retail Tomtom Mobile Navigator for iPhone, iPad, and iTouch don't come with are :


1. Detailed map seamlessly covering Australia with IQ RoutesÃ¢â€žÂ¢ data for faster routing.Map coverage statistics:

* countries fully covered (99.9%): China

3. Radar Safety Speed Cameras with Red Light Cameras at Intersections. The TomTom Safety Camera Service provides audio and visual alerts of dangerous intersections on your route. With this service, you'll know which intersections are monitored by red light cameras.
