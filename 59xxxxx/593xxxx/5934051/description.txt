The deluxe, remastered version of the 1986 album.
Already writing for what was intended to be the
guitarists first solo album, Tony Iommi was
persuaded to brand the record as a Black Sabbath
release, hence the rather lumpen moniker, Black
Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi. With both bassist
and drummer positions now having greater
significance, Iommi recruited the skills of Dave
The Beast Spitz and drummer Eric Singer (later
of Kiss renown) and for the first time the
position of a keyboardist became a visible credit
and long-serving back-room operator, Geoff
Nicholls was finally brought to the foreground as
an official member. However, it would be the
position of lead vocalist that would have the
greatest impact upon the new Sabbath sound and the
appointment of ex-Trapeze and Deep Purple
bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes, set interest and
expectations high.

But regardless of what these new recruits would
bring to the melting pot, musically, this new
Black Sabbath album would be somewhat of a
departure from what was expected from the name.
Iommi had obviously been writing to please his
personal musical palette and not to order for
the Black Sabbath fan-base. As such, the songs on
Seventh Star are more blues-inclined and in the
case of the single release, No Stranger To Love,
an altogether more AOR and radio-friendly breeze
is adopted.

There but for the grace of god, the twelfth
official Black Sabbath studio album was released
on 28th January 1986. Inevitably reviews were
mixed but die-hard Sabs took the record to the
number 27 position in the UK and number 78 in the
US.

This re-mastered Deluxe Expanded Edition of the
album adds the US Remix of the No Stranger To
Love single and also for the very first time on
CD, a live performance from Londons Hammersmith
Odeon in June 86 which features then unknown
American singer, Ray Gillen on lead vocals who was
brought in to complete the tour following the
departure of Glenn Hughes due to illness.
