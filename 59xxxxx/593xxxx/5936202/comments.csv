Appreciate your efforts! :)"
,etowhid,2010-11-05T17:02Z,"Thank you for Fringe. I have very low speed internet connection, so it's really great to have such high quality+lower sized files. I really appreciate your work.

What's your recommended ratio for your torrents? I'm just downloading the Fringe episode, how much do I have to upload?"

,hkoraddi,2010-11-05T17:53Z,guys please seed this is the first time i am facing problem like this on 2040 torrents....
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-05T18:15Z,@hkoraddi: I seed. Why you cannot connect to my server - I have no clue. My 8000 kB/s should be enough for your needs.
,jon4fun,2010-11-05T18:30Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode(s)/upload.

Cheers
Jon"
,sanyam123,2010-11-05T18:38Z,thanks 2040:-)
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-05T18:51Z,"Thanks.

@etowhid: As much as you can, it's up to you. Remember, you help others by giving them fair chance to download the show you both like.
If you download one show, stay to seed to the next episode. If you download a lot from me - 24h is enough or 1.084:1 ratio. On single episode of each show I upload I have ratio 140 - 200:1 at the end of 24h period."
,kzrockz,2010-11-05T18:56Z,thnkx for TBBT.Happyyyyy Diwalllliiiiiiiiiiii 2 all of u
,lilars26,2010-11-05T19:23Z,Thanks for the shows.
,DMVIN,2010-11-05T19:46Z,"20-40, a question for you. 
In the future will you continue with the daily show and the colbert report? 

Thanks for your hard work"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-05T20:50Z,"@DMVIN: No, I have done that and it was disaster. "
,kabzie,2010-11-06T00:12Z,hi 2040 thanx for encoded episodes great work  most appreciated i was wondering if u could hook me up with house md season 7 from episode 5 nowards if u can 
,jon4fun,2010-11-06T01:43Z,"@ ALL - This is crazy! 20-40 has created thes great PACKS to choose from and no-one is seeding. 

It's the start of the month, they are small file sizes - YOU have NO excuse not to seed.

Jon"
,saurabh1992,2010-11-06T05:21Z,thanx for the big bang theory...
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-06T10:41Z,"Please, seed for sake-of-god! Don't force me to do unpleasant shit.

@kabzie: House has been dropped off from my schedule and from any consideration like two years ago.

@Jon: Which one is badly seeded? Let me know and such shows would be kicked off no matter supposed ""popularity"". Fake ""popularity"" (downloading/grabbing and not seeding back) never stopped me in doing what must be done."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-06T11:58Z,"I just checked, pretending to be plain downloader. I have seen (and been connected to) three guys with 100%, two Transmissions and BitTorrent 7.1 - but - I cannot establish connection to my own seeding server!
It's not usual PeerBlock or FW, I disabled them both, encryption too and raised number of connections to 64... Nothing...

I don't know what is that, I was seeing that seeding speed from my seeding server is extremely low - dragging around 400 kB/s what is stupid.
It might be that my seeding server IP address is blocked somewhere - by someone, and as usual - flooded by paid shills and byte-thrashers...
But - I cannot do anything about. Sorry.

Therefore - main goal and a proof of established connection to my seeding server is appearance of my BiTTornado with 100%. Each downloader who can connect to me - can achieve light-speed download."
,abj642,2010-11-06T13:48Z,thanks 20-40 for TBBT and mentalist
,adamystyle,2010-11-06T14:02Z,could you please put the shows separately again seeding would be faster
,adamystyle,2010-11-06T14:04Z,what abt glee?
,skillet92,2010-11-06T14:41Z,"hey bro.!
i have uploaded to about 1:5 ratio still ...and still continuing to do so!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-06T15:58Z,"@skillet92: I loaded both - but I advised like zillion times NOT to load dead torrents, or old ones. I keep files max. 48h on seeding-server. These two I seed from home and your opal does not go above silly 1 kB/s. It would take ages and I cannot seed from home longer than hour-two...

@skillet92: Do not over-stress your connection.

@adamystyle: Glee is doing fine and TV pack stays - I can upload fast enough. Problem is not on my side."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-06T16:06Z,@doyll: First one was for you. Mistake. sorry.
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-06T17:02Z,"@doyll: Finally - with uTP I achieved stable 55 kB/s to your opal ISP and Caprica is finished as I wrote. Armored would be 'finito' in next 45 minutes.
So, it's clear indication that your ISP isn't particulars happy with P2P traffic and try to block undisguised packets. Well..."
,erni75,2010-11-07T00:23Z,"I'm looking for season 1 of East Bound and Down, can you help me out"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-07T07:24Z,@erni75: I can send you links for direct download of DVDrip or similar. My e-mail address is in the header.
