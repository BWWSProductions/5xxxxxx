,shaneocuk,2011-04-02T02:51Z,"game is ripped wrong, you need the original xbox 360 game burner. can download it here, its the best one out there it works with every xbox 360 game. www.game-burner.com "
,Spollero,2011-04-19T23:30Z,"Is everyone here noob. I can't find anything useful in the comments.
I already DL'd a nother torrent of the game, but I somehow f'd it up. ImgBurn couldn't verify once it was burned and abgx360 couldn't either. I just threw the disc into the trash.

Now what I'm looking for is the retail version of the game that has been ripped with SSv2 drive. Is this file like that?

Well. I'll just Dl this and I take a look.

I broke my legit Black Ops disc and I need a new one for clan matches and shit. I had the game installed on my HDD, but when I changed my console to a new one the game wouldn't play."
,tijnieneder,2011-05-08T09:43Z,"are there files missing or can I just start playing?

Then what Files to i need to highlight and extract with WinRAR? I have tried 3 times to burn thsi but it shows call of duty Black Ops on the xbox menu, but when i click to play the game it goes to a black screen and stays there... Can Someone please help me?? I dont want to waste another Disc.. I Burned Dirt 3 and it works Great  but when i Opened that folder all it had in it was an ISO File and a DVD File.. Thanks for helping.  Seeding "
,mojobaby27,2011-08-02T00:03Z,"Thanks deffjam555,
this copy works great. For all having trouble make sure you read the last line of the description. You have to unrar the fix first, go to the file where it has unrared to, cut and paste the fix file into the regular black ops folder and run the fix first. Passes all ABGX."
,jtmolloy93,2011-08-20T04:22Z,For this Game to Work you need to be on LT1.91+ and on the latest dashboard. It will not work with any other LT or Dashboard.
,Stratz,2011-09-14T22:05Z,"You could have included a readme file, all there is are bunch of files,  yea sure you said to put files in folder to main folder but you don't tell us anything after that about what to do with the two files that come out of it."
,Stratz,2011-09-14T22:09Z,What do I do with the cpx-codb.iso file i get out of unraring the files in the main folder? Put it on my usb then load it on xbox? Help please?
