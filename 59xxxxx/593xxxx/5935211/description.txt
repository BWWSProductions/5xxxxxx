Herein lies a recording of piano music by Franz Schubert by Maurizio Pollini. Included are the three late sonatas D 958, 959, 960, as well as Allegretto in C minor (D 915) and Drei Klavierstucke.

This comes from a 2-CD set released by Deutsche Grammophon in 1987


Encoded in FLAC compression-level 5.





**Tagging is done as follows:
Artist == Composer
Album == Name of the work
Title == Title of a part or movement in a work
Genre == The performer(s)
Track == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.

I've done filenames as "%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title"
