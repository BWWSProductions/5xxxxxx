           Ben has been single for a long time. For his part, he is       
           a loner but as well a romantic: he enjoys the solitude of      
           his simple being but appreciates intelligent and witty         
           company just the same. By yielding to both extremes, Ben       
           remains caught between reason and arousal. Isabel has          
           been married for a year. The passion that had once             
           carried her 5-year relationship has lost its pulse.            
           Passive, protective, and without poise, it now threatens       
           to claim hers. Waiting in abeyance, Isabel is lost             
           between loyalty and loneliness. Uptown is where they come      
           together.
