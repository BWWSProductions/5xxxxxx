John, Julian and Paul go to the forest on the Kaibab National Forest three-week journey of his life in search of peyote and the vision of what he gives. Each of them took with him only a knife, a bottle of water and a garbage bag. After a week of travel events take a disastrous turn and everything around is changing and they themselves are forced to confront the darkest recesses of their morality and mortality. They must fight the elements and each other to leave the forest alive.
