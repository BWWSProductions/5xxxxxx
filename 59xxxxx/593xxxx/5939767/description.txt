and the effect of the installation method on bearing capacity and uplift are analyzed in Chapter 17.
Foundations on swelling and collapsible soils are treated in Chapter 18 as are methods that can be
used to reduce heave. This is an important subject, seldom treated in textbooks. The design of
retaining walls is covered in Chapter 19, as well as the different factors that affect active and
passive earth pressures. Different applications of geotextiles are covered in this chapter as well as
the topic of reinforced earth. Cantilever, anchored, and strutted sheet pile walls are investigated in
Chapter 20, as are methods to evaluate stability and the moment distribution. Different soil
improvement methods, such as compaction of granular soils, sand compaction piles,
vibroflotation, preloading, and stone columns, are described in Chapter 21. The chapter also
discusses lime and cement stabilization. Appendix A provides a list of SI units, and Appendix B
compares methods that have been proposed.
This textbook by Prof. V. N. S. Murthy is highly recommended for students specializing in
geotechnical engineering and for practicing civil engineers in the United States and Europe. The
book includes recent developments such as soil improvement and stabilization methods and
applications of geotextiles to control settlements and lateral earth pressure. Numerous graphs and
examples illustrate the most important concepts in geotechnical engineering. This textbook
should serve as a valuable reference book for many years to come.
BengtB.Broms, Ph.D.
Nanyang Technical University, Singapore (retired).It gives me great pleasure to write a foreword for Geotechnical Engineering: Principles and
Practices of Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering. This comprehensive, pertinent and up-
to-date volume is well suited for use as a textbook for undergraduate students as well as a
reference book for consulting geotechnical engineers and contractors. This book is well written
with numerous examples on applications of basic principles to solve practical problems.
The early history of geotechnical engineering and the pioneering work of Karl Terzaghi in
the beginning of the last century are described in Chapter 1. Chapters 2 and 3 discuss methods of
classification of soil and rock, the chemical and the mechanical weathering of rock, and soil phase
relationships and consistency limits for clays and silts. Numerous examples illustrate the
relationship between the different parameters. Soil permeability and seepage are investigated in
Chapter 4. The construction of flow nets and methods to determine the permeability in the
laboratory and in the field are also explained.
The concept of effective stress and the effect of pore water pressure on effective stress are
discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 is concerned with stress increase in soil caused by surface load
and methods to calculate stress increase caused by spread footings, rafts, and pile groups. Several
examples are given in Chapter 6. Consolidation of soils and the evaluation of compressibility in
the laboratory by oedometer tests are investigated in Chapter 7. Determination of drained and
undrained shear strength by unconfined compression, direct shear or triaxial tests is treated in
Chapter 8.
The important subject of soil exploration is discussed in Chapter 9, including the use of
penetration tests such as SPT and CPT in different countries. The stability of slopes is investigated
in Chapter 10. Methods using plain and circular slip surfaces to evaluate stability are described
such as the methods proposed by Bishop, Fellenius, Morgenstern, and Spencer. Chapter 11
discusses methods to determine active and passive earth pressures acting on retaining and sheet
pile walls.
Bearing capacity and settlement of foundation and the evaluation of compressibility in the
laboratory by oedometer tests are discussed in Chapters 12, 13, and 14. The effect of inclination
and eccentricity of the load on bearing capacity is also examined. Chapter 15 describes different
pile types, the concept of critical depth, methods to evaluate the bearing capacity of piles in
cohesive and cohesionless soils, and pile-driving formulae. The behavior of laterally loaded piles
is investigated in Chapter 16 for piles in sand and in clay. The behavior of drilled pier foundations
and the effect of the installation method on bearing capacity and uplift are analyzed in Chapter 17.
Foundations on swelling and collapsible soils are treated in Chapter 18 as are methods that can be
used to reduce heave. This is an important subject, seldom treated in textbooks. The design of

Geotechnical Engineering: Principles and Practices of Soil Mechanics and Foundation
Engineering is a long title befitting a major work. I am pleased to introduce this superb volume
destined for a readership of students, professors, and consultants. What makes this text different
from other books on these subjects that appear each year and why am I recommending it to you? I
have been working and teaching in the area of geotechnical engineering for 25 years. I have read
and used scores of textbooks in my classes and practice. Dr. Murthy's text is by far the most
comprehensive text I have found. You will find that his organization of the subject matter follows
a logical progression. His example problems are numerous and, like the text, start from fundamental
principles and progressively develop into more challenging material. They are the best set of
example problems I have seen in a textbook. Dr. Murthy has included ample homework problems
with a range of difficulty meant to help the student new to the subject to develop his/her
confidence and to assist the experienced engineer in his/her review of the subject and in
professional development.
As the technical editor I have read the entire manuscript three times. I have been impressed by
the coverage, the clarity of the presentation, and the insights into the hows and whys of soil and
foundation behavior. Often I have been astonished at Dr. Murthy's near-conversational approach to
sharing helpful insights. You get the impression he's right there with you guiding you along,
anticipating your questions, and providing instruction and necessary information as the next steps
in the learning process. I believe you will enjoy this book and that it will receive a warm welcome
wherever it is used.
I thank Dr. Murthy for his commitment to write this textbook and for sharing his professional
experience with us. I thank him for his patience in making corrections and considering suggestions.
I thank Mr. B. J. Clark, Senior Acquisitions Editor at Marcel Dekker Inc., for the opportunity to be
associated with such a good book. I likewise express my appreciation to Professor Pierre Foray of
1'Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Hydraulique et de Mecanique de Grenoble, Institut National
Polytechnique de Grenoble, France for his enthusiastic and unflagging support while I edited the
manuscript.




A must have for all geotechnical engineers and engineering students

Remember to seed and Enjoy!!!!!!!!!
