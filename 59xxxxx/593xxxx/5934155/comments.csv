,oddmanoutgt,2010-11-06T18:09Z,"Something's wrong.   The file won't play, not even with VLC.   It just says invalid file.    ??????"
,muhu88,2010-11-06T20:13Z,"I watched it on VLC.
It's fine"
,oddmanoutgt,2010-11-07T05:03Z,"Ok, I figured it out!  The folder and file names were too long.  So I shorten both of them and now it plays great.   Thanx again."

,Davkar2,2010-11-07T16:48Z,Some members said they got error - invalid file name - cause is file name too long - you don't get the right click functions so can't shorten it - simple solution - copy then paste folder in same location - this changes file name on copy to shorter version - you can then change it to anything you like. Copy will play on all/most media players. Delete original. To prevent this use no more than 16 characters in file names.
