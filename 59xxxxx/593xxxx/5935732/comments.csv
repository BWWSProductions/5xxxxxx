Thought it is just another Disgea-whatever-clone, but when i red what people say about the game, and about the previous Ys: Seven - i've changed my mind. Besides, game seems pretty fine as i checked it out. Hope you'll enjoy it too.

P.S.: Let me know if there is smth i should release, but haven't done yet."

,jemaiah,2010-11-10T02:53Z,it wont work on 5.00 M33-6 please help...  what should i do?
,JIHUIN,2010-11-10T06:24Z,"@jemaiah:
You have two options to solve your problem.

1st option: Try using different memory stick, I suggest you use the original SONY PRO DUO MARK 2. The Mark 2 designation indicates the Memory Stick is suitable for use with AVCHD recording products or other faster Memory Stick enabled devices by providing appropriate minimum write performance.

2nd option: You upgrade the system version of your PSP to 5.50 GEN-D3 or Prometheus-3 for 5.00 M33-6. Below is the download link for GEN-D3 and Prometheus 3.
For 5.50 GEN-D3 = http://www.psp-hacks.com/file/1873
For Prometheus-3 (5.00 M33-6) = http://www.psp-hacks.com/file/1987

Hope this will solve your problem."

Also, here is the video link how to upgrade 5.00 M33-6 into 5.50 GEN-D3.

,jemaiah,2010-11-12T09:42Z,:c i cant play Ys in my psp.. it will shut down... what should i do.?? /sad 
,jemaiah,2010-11-12T09:52Z,"Ys: This game could not be started 
      (80020148)

,JIHUIN,2010-11-13T03:32Z,"@jemaiah,

You must download CTF Themes for 5.50 GEN-D3. Your previous CTF themes only runs on your old custom firmware. Try these link to download free 5.50 CTF Themes. http://www.freeforpsp.com/CTF-Themes/indexp2.html"
,JIHUIN,2010-11-13T03:40Z,"@jemaiah
Try changing your CPU Clock to 333/166. To change the setting of CPU Clock you must go the VSH Menu by pressing the SELECT button.
Set the CPU Clock Game to 333/166
Set the CPU Clock XMB to 333/166
Set ISO Mode to SONY NP9660
Then exit and try the game...hope this would help you.

One more thing, try to disable all your plugins (Ex. CWCheat, CXMB, Naruto 3 plugins and etc.) Then try to run the game. If the game runs, you activate your plugins one at a time to see which of the plugins is having a conflict to run this game."
,jemaiah,2010-11-13T05:23Z,"@JIHUIN 

Cool Themes in the link that u gave me but.... there`s 1 problem... i dont know how to download the themes.. >.<


and at the info you gave me for the VHS i already do what told me... but this game will shutdown after the prologue... >."
,jemaiah,2010-11-13T05:39Z,@JIHUIN CTF themes wont work in my psp... >.< PTF is fine.../sigh 
,JIHUIN,2010-11-13T08:31Z,"@jemaiah
To run your CTF Themes you need to install CXMB for GEN-D3. Here is the video link how to put CXMB for GEN series. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Knw9ZSXsUeo&feature=related

Regarding the Ys game, if your PSP shutdowns at the prologue portion then I suspect your memory stick has a problem. You do not have any other option but to try new memory stick...that's the last advice that I can give to you...hope it will work...good luck."
,jemaiah,2010-11-16T10:13Z,"@JIHUIN

thank you... :) new themes are working... but the game aint workin... i guess i`ll hav to buy UMD for this one... >.<

""I was pretty sceptic 'bout releasing this one. Thought it is just another Disgea-whatever-clone""

I should slap you for that comment :P

Oath in Felghana is actually a (total) remake of and older game from the early 90's called Wanderes from Ys. I also believe that the PC version of Oath in Felghana is older than any Disgaea games"
,cereal_killah,2011-01-06T15:37Z,every time I load a saved game my psp crashes... so I really can't play the game... anybody else having this problem?
,cereal_killah,2011-01-08T21:42Z,nevermind... changed ISO mode to M33 driver and everything works fine... thanks nitrogen
,NitrogenUA,2011-02-07T18:26Z,"Q91, my bad :D Turns out, you're right! :) It's a shame, i was a 3-year-old kid when this epic game was released :) Peace. ;)"
,LewLxD,2011-05-27T04:59Z,"hey NitrogenUA, does Ys: oath in felghana and Ys seven the same?"
