Also keep seeding dont just hit and run , seed as fast as your isp lets u upload ,the faster your upload speed the faster your download speed is for recieving data thats how bittorent works !im not a hypocrite sometimes when i go 2 post info tpb says database error failed to write..i dont have time 2  go back 2 the files i couldnt help out on , A good place to get help is http://forum.suprbay.org/index.php report fake files or drm files there
 ,ps if you look at porn remember to respect women theyre gods greatest creation.

I am so sick of reading your copy and paste rant.  why dont you just put up the imdb link yourself, it would probibly be quicker than posting the same comment on every movie  uploaded.

oh, and just like most of the movies you are posting this crap on...the imdb link is right in the info given by the uploader."
