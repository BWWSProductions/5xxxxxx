Effective irrigation, enhanced pertinent technologies, thereby provides a most lucrative source for making agriculture profitable and worthwhile. This book has been written as a manual guiding agricultural engineers on the principles and concepts which define irrigation engineering. Elaborating upon the tools, technologies and techniques which are essential to the field, the text takes a look at the types of irrigation, including surface, localised and sprinkler systems, and how they are changing agriculture itself by making it more scientific. In addition to it the challenges faced by irrigation systems including those of entrophication, water pollution, depletion of underground aquifers, etc., are also discussed. Current trends and development have been analysed as well as the future prospects and opportunities.
