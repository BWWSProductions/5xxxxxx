This is brilliant!

Just a few observations here for the benefit of anyone who (like me) is new to TTS (and pirating).

The languages can be downloaded separately, e.g. Bridget is just 500+MB.

In my case, I needed English and Japanese. Since I already had US voices Julie,Kate,Paul on my system I decided to try Bridget, hoping that it might be a UK voice. And not only is it a UK voice, it also happens to be very good!

Bridget is comparable to Julie (US) as far as the pleasantness of tone. But it seems to sound slightly more natural than Julie (even at higher speeds). It also seems more 'intelligent' (in terms of intonation, pronunciation of foreign names / words, and how it interprets numerals, special symbols, and errors, (e.g. strings of 2-3 words without spaces, such as produced by weak OCR software (notably Acrobat))).

In short, Bridget is the BEST voice I have come across so far!

Also, a little trick I just learnt: using TTS for forums can be hard because such webpages contain so much hidden and repetitive text that it often amounts to more than the actual human comments. In FIREFOX it is possible to select multiple discontinuous portions of text simply by holding down CTRL! So simply multi-copy the bits you want to hear, paste them into a prog like TextAloud, and forget about having to listen to (or Find/Replace) 100s of ""Rate this Comment""-type of phrases."
