FLAWL3SS NOTES
We noticed there was like 15 mins of nothing but black video at the end so we decided to edit that out. We also decided to leave the logo property of there. we would have blurred it but when we did it looked ugly and cropping it was out of the question specially since you would lose so much of the top. We did our normal stuff to it. We brighten We also worked on  the contrast, denoiser and finally a sharpen filter to it. Hope you all enjoy from team FLAWL3SS.
