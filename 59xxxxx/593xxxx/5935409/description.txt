"Truly, Madly, Pradeeply"

When Asha (Rebecca Hazlewood) begins taking 
the next step toward her arranged marriage, 
Todd (Ben Rappaport) and Manmeet (Sacha 
Dhawan) step in and devise a plan that will 
make Todd a potential suitor. Overhearing 
Todd's feelings for Asha, Madhuri (Anisha 
Nagarajan) gives him her ticket to a 
concert so he can surprise her and have a 
Bollywood ending. Meanwhile, Rajiv (Rizwan 
Manji) tries to help Gupta (Parvesh Cheena) 
get over a bad habit.

Enjoy :)
