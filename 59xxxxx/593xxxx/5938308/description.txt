Ottowa, Canada 1996

Date: 96-08-05
Venue: The Palladium

Recording: AUD
Quality: 8
Menu: No
Extras: None
Comments: Single cam on the balcony stage right. Clear picture with some pixelation but the shooting is a bit shaky. (Screenshots a lot blurrier than actual video.) Partially shot on the screen. Audio is very powerful and clear but suffers from some problems (most notably in King of the night time world when there's also serious tape warbling towards the end) and a fairly consistent noise. Missing part of RARAN.
