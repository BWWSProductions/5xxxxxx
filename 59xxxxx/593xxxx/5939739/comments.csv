,tybomb,2010-11-07T23:51Z,"Opera07 is ""aborting"" the download because he's being redirected to a codec page? lol. What a f0000cking moron.  Does the MPAA actually pay people to write comments this stupid? I can see it if it was something halfways believable but they're really not getting their money's worth here. 
No wonder they need so much money from their lawsuits! lol.
Retards like Opera are getting bags of cash despite being completely out of touch with the internet."

awesome video quality for being an R5. It is between VHS and DVD quality. But the sound is not so good... almost like you couldnt pay to get into the drive in movie and you had to stand outside of the fense and try to listen in. Perhaps someone with good audio equipment can go get better audio and sync it with this video.

,roon13,2010-11-10T19:32Z,"any link for subtitles???
audio is inaudible!!!!"
,sxp64,2010-11-11T18:22Z,Why are ALL the R5 rippers such idiots when it comes to audio everytime? It isn't that hard. Use a pair of headphones and some common sense. Learn a thing or two about audio engineering.

,wayneking,2010-12-05T03:05Z,"Thank you very much for the UL.... It is NOT fake!  What idiot said it is?!!!

Sound is absolutely terrible though and personally, while I'm not usually fussy AT ALL when it comes to newer releases, this is a rare case where the sound made it impossible to watch the movie IMO.  I couldn't even make out a lot of the dialogue using good earphones.

Video quality is pretty damned good, but the sound really stinks.  If someone has the tech' knowhow I lack and can marry/synch' this video with a decent soundtrack, please post the link for DL here.  Thanks."
,gsmforum2009,2010-12-11T17:15Z,"can't watch it, sound is really poor !"
