editorial content and classified advertising. It is geared toward 
more advanced users than its sister publication, SmartComputing. 
Regular guest writers used to include Chris Pirillo. CPU Magazine 
differs from most other computing magazines in that it focuses 
more on the latest hardware rather than software or gaming."
