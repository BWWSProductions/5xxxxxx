    A guy called Eric (Hense the title) owns a huge house and some greedy    
    people want to build a mall over it. So they get someone to burn down    
    his house. Eric is badly burned but not dead, and a year later the       
    mall opens. What they don't realise is that Eric is living underneath    
    the mall and he's very angry!
