,Gummi625,2010-11-03T16:16Z,What is it with the talking in it
,dakty,2010-11-03T18:11Z,looks like they used the wrong audio channel when broadcasting this
,drcat123,2010-11-04T03:37Z,the whole thing is trash. you ruined it with the talking
,morgane98,2010-11-04T13:29Z,"@drcat123 -- ""They"" didn't mess it up -- WWE did. You're hearing the behind-the-scenes production audio. You know, the stuff WWE doesn't want you to hear. There are other torrents with the show audio, or you can just watch it on wwe.com"
,Bartolllo,2010-11-04T14:37Z,"This is a real gem.... Like a coin with a
mistake, made during the minting process.
It gives you an insight to the editing process
of the show. I actually enjoyed it.
The announcers bore me anyway.
