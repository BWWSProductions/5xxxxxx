,ShadowJax04,2010-11-15T01:26Z,"why is everything ingame transparent? i have tried adjusting every single setting, reinstalled, uninstalled and force rechecked the torrent...

any suggestions would be apriciated"
,Fooooook,2010-11-19T07:56Z,"There is no crack for the hotfix. 

Heres what you can do:

1. Replace crack with original .exe
2. Install digital hotfix update
3. Replace with same crack

The game will not detect the new version because of the crack though.

I don't think anyone is working on a crack so you'll have to live with the 30fps cap."
,djangoman,2010-11-21T10:00Z,"The highest possible resolution seems to be 720.  When i play on that res everything in game is black, including char. creation.  When i turn the res down i can play, but the game looks like its on ps1.  like 15 yrs old.  It is also crashing.  I wouldn't bother if i were you.  This is first Reloaded game ever that i dont recommend."
,imranaziz,2010-11-21T18:51Z,"@spanner76

I m having the same problem too. I even installed the hotfix patch and then added the crack file provided here but to no use. Game freezes after 5/10 minutes of play. 
I m running on dual core 2 duo and Geforce 8600 gt with 2 gigs of ram.
Any help would be appreciated.. "

It says Version 1.4.910"

MAKE SURE TO SELECT THE DIGITAL VERSION NOT THE DVD VERSION!!! also make sure u MUST put the original Divinity2.exe or the patch will not see it! 

This seems to have worked for me. still a bit stuttery but my system isnt great nor is it horrible."

Thanks, AiTB! :D"
,Fooooook,2010-11-23T18:10Z,Keep in mind that there is no crack for the new hotfix. You can use the crack that came with the game but then the game will not detect the hotfix.
,psychomantum,2010-11-23T22:02Z,"FYI: I downloaded this torrent and installed it just fine. I followed these steps:

1. Mounted image in Daemon Tools
2. Installed
3. Downloaded and installed the hotfix
4. Copied the crack over from the /Crack dir on the DVD
5. Launched the game

Everything works fine. I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit. I have an ATI 4850 and an AMD Phenom x4 955."
,K_Charlie,2010-11-26T15:23Z,"If your like me & had the transparent texture problem ∨ black screen.. This fixed it for me.
Locate to 
C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Divinity 2\Profile
& edit graphicoptions.xml
Change the resolution to 
ScreenWidth=""1440"" ScreenHeight=""900""

Reason for this, if you try to change the resolution ingame it never works & your stuck with transparent textures or with HDR disabled a black screen.
You can keep HDR on after this."
,dothackjhe,2010-11-27T07:26Z,The game works fine with me. No problems whatsoever. Thanks for the game RELOADED! ^(^O^)^
,Daemn,2010-11-27T12:31Z,"The error during startup (after logos) is likely from a Physx warning. I changed to windowed mode and it says warning, Physx version is different. So I uninstalled 9.10.0514 and installed 9.10.0513. Now it works. I couldn't get the hotfix working, but I assume one thing it does is remove that warning (which is acting like an error).

,djangoman,2010-12-04T11:29Z,"You must copy (highlight and hit ""ctrl + C"" or right click and select copy) all of the content in the crack folder (which is located inside the ISO image) and paste it into the install folder (then when prompted you must select the -COPY AND REPLACE- option for the file transfer.) For me the default game installs always go to -program files(x86)- folder. If a shotcut icon is placed on your desktop by the install, right click it and select -open file location-. hope that helps  "

I Installed the digital hotfix over the original exe, replaced that with the cracked one. Then I tested different resolutions, 1280*800 seems to be the highest one that works for me. I haven't played the game yet, so we'll see if my luck lasts."

During my research i found out that if you don't have a legit copy of this game it will run shitty on purpose, the game was created like this by the developers to deter cracks and hacked copies. so go buy the real game and enjoy it fully people."
,brdavs,2011-01-19T22:10Z,"I tried Divinity 2 when it first came out and had huge performance issues. Didnt get past starting area. 

Gave Dragon Knight Saga a shot and it works like a charm. 

Didnt encounter any bugs and its a truly great H&S game. 

Visuals are good, quests are fully voiced (sometimes humorously badly lol). Plenty of humor, rich story you get into and exploring the world while hoping from human to dragon form is incredibly fun. Balista tower combat sucks tho lol.     

I wholeheartedly reccomend this. Very underrated game imo. "
