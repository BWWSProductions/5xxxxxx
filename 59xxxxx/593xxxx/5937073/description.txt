When down-and-out silver miner Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis in an Academy Award-winning role) gets a mysterious tip-off that there's a little town out West where an ocean of oil is oozing out of the ground, he heads with his son, H.W., to take their chances in dust-worn Little Boston. In this hardscrabble town, Plainview and H.W. make their lucky strike. But even as the well raises of all their fortunes, nothing will remain the same as conflicts escalate and every human value is imperiled by corruption, deception and the flow of oil.
