,illizit,2011-06-03T17:17Z,"its fucking crime they canceled it...
best damn show that was ever on that channel even if it is recycled stand up routines...
the animation to them made it all more hucking filarious"
,illizit,2011-06-03T21:06Z,hm i can see why it got cancelled now from the last few episodes when they started to leave the shorties started to leave the house... but doesnt seem like that great a reason since the stand up stuff still awesome
