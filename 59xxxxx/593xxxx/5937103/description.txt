++++++++++++
Alex scheduled a full 4th hour today, then extended the broadcast 30 minutes into a 5th hour to continue his conversation with Joe Rogan and a comedian friend of Rogan's who was also in studio.  Neither GCN nor infowars has made audio of the 5th hour available for download.  I was unable to record it because I was already recording Mike Rivero's show. See my blog for further details.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
