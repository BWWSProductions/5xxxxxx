From the publishers page:

"This book is an introductory programming textbook for those using SML. It emphasizes mathematical structures, modelling and abstraction as a basis for programming, introducing students to formal methods concepts early. The authors concentrate on the basics of program design rather than on the design of efficient algorithms. The book has a dual purpose, firstly to teach program design based on a set of simple, clean & powerful concepts and secondly to teach the fundamental concepts of computer science in an informal but precise way."
