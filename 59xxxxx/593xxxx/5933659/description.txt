Duran Duran - Skin Trade [promo].VOB 



Very HQ rare promo music video. "Skin Trade" is the 15th single from 
Duran Duran, and the second single from the Notorious album. It was 
released in February 1987, reached #22 on the UK Singles Chart, and 
barely nudged into the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. 

This "Skin Trade" video was the second filmed for the band by directors 
Peter Kagan and Paula Greif, after "Notorious". Film of band members 
performing was treated with a rotoscope-like effect, adding vivid colors 
to details like a person's eyes or jewelry. Like so many other Duran 
Duran videos, "Skin Trade" included a beautiful woman - in this case 
German supermodel Tatjana Patitz. Her image was rotoscoped for some 
scenes as well, and her dancing figure was superimposed on several 
different vividly colored abstract backgrounds. 

Session guitarist Warren Cuccurullo, who would later become a full member 
of the band, appears in the video, although his face is not often seen. 
Cuccurullo also contributed the power chords and harmony parts on the 
bridges of the album track, with Nile Rodgers playing the others.
