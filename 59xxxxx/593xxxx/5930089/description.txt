(5 New doses, Hear, See, Smell, Taste, Touch,  all complements to the Zen-Cart bug.)

After all my searching i have compiled a pack of I-Doser drg files that include EVERY dose, enjoy my torrent and i hope you enjoy your digital drugs! :D

To Convert to WAV you need to download and INSTALL SBaGeN (http://uazu.net/sbagen/)

Step 1: Go to this Website (http://www.khattam.info/drg2sbg/) to convert your .drg files to .sbg

Step 2: Right click your newly made .sbg file and click "Write to WAV"

Step 3(OPTIONAL): Use a audio converter to convert to MP3 or other audio types, MP3 is not recommended though as it is very lossy, use FLAC instead 


(100% of these are confirmed real, including Gate of Hades, and Hand of God. :) I figured out how to download them from i-doser.com directly. Zen-Cart bug, nuff said.)

Credits to lolsack for originally finding the drg files. I just made certain they were real official files, and replaced the ones that were not.
