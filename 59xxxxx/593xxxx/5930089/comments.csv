However, I can't stop you from doing it but I highly recommend staying away from converting .drg files. It ruins the quality of the dose regardless of how the audio sounds. Also beware of .drg files that are converted to .mp3. The real I-Doser .mp3s are different (shorter length and contain background sounds like noise or music) from the .drg versions plus only a handful of doses have .mp3 versions."
,mrmojorisin91,2011-02-24T05:46Z,Is there a way to listen to these in .drg files?
,mailclu,2011-05-31T04:02Z,Seed please! I will return the favor.
