What started as a simple "heh, these songs go nice together" quickly turned into a huge, multi-week-long mixing project on a quest for perfection. Then, with a nice 1-hour continuous mix finally laid out, I wanted to put it on CD. So the cue file was born. Then, the problem... the only discs I have are inkjet printable. Needs some label art. So the label was born. Then I wanted a nice cover art to put on it so foobar2000 doesn't look all desolate and blank. And I wanted a nice back cover for the disc as well. So the front and back cover art was born as well. Now, there's about 3 weeks of work put into this thing, and I know the world would love to have it.

Don't get your panties in a bunch just yet... but the source for most of these songs (except a couple) were 320k or V0 MP3s bought online from sites like Beatport. Hence providing a FLAC download as well as the standard MP3 download, so with the FLAC download you can enjoy the original quality without further degradation. The V0 MP3 is a smaller download but with minor degradation due to lossy-lossy encoding on many songs.

Without further adieu, here's the list of tracks:
#01] BSOD - This Is The Hook
#02] Deadmau5 - Ghosts N Stuff feat. Rob Swire
#03] Alex Metric - What Now
#04] Boys Noize - Kontact Me
