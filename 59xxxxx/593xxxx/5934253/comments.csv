,LanMax,2010-11-24T02:59Z,It says English in the Description. I will get back when I'm done.
,LanMax,2010-11-24T03:02Z,"Actuall it's a Swedish Film, so I'd rather have it in Swedish than English as long as there's also a Sub. I'll reply back."
,LanMax,2010-11-25T03:16Z,perfect. it's in swedish (i think) with eng sub. Thank you! HD.

,dingathewinger,2010-12-23T21:08Z,"Downloaded, how do you gat the subtitles to show? Noob question I know but I want to see this movie "
,necr0god,2011-01-06T17:28Z,"Width                            : 1 280 pixels
Height                           : 544 pixels

Not to spoil it to anyone but a proper 720p usually means the resolution is 1920 x 720."
,QuarterBall,2011-01-16T17:39Z,720p refers only to the vertical resolution - to be 720p the vertical resolution MUST be 720.
,effthesun,2011-01-18T15:39Z,is the spoken language dubbed in english (dumb thing) or originally in swedish?
,fakebest,2011-01-29T20:39Z,@necr0god actually your dumbass and 1920x720 would be a ridiculous way to watch anything. 720p is 1280x720 but since films go by a lower vertical resolution so the aspect ration is about 21:9 instead of hdtv 16:9 the vertical resolution will be 544 pixels and sometimes a little more depending on the cameras used. so by HD standards this is comparable to 720p that is why everyone labels it as such even the people who make it. you stupid fuck now go die in a pool of acid.
,miknos,2011-02-10T03:44Z,"Spanish subtitle:

,HelTrooper666,2011-07-03T14:44Z,Hey guys any idea how to hardsub this file??
,magi123,2011-10-12T10:49Z,"good rip, thank you."
,fillinthisspace,2012-01-02T03:58Z,"@ fakebest, did you get picked on a lot at school? Does nobody listen to you at home or at work? I don't understand why some people seem to feel the need to write such abusive comments here. Maybe they don't get laid or they're living out some hero fantasy they can't live up to in real life. Or maybe it's just that they're not very bright."
,fillinthisspace,2012-01-02T04:19Z,"@ QuarterBall, for the record 720p includes the top and bottom black bars used for aspect ratios wider than 16:9. Usually when encoding video those black bars are removed, but it doesn't change the resolution of the remaining video. The player simply adds back the black bars on playback. Therefore resolutions such as 1280x544 etc are still labelled as 720p.
If people started using labels such as 544p or 576p it'd get way to confusing. This way you know you're getting 720p (or 1080p) video, just minus the black bars.

@ necr0god, 720p is actually 1280x720 (including any black bars). 1080p is 1920x1080."
