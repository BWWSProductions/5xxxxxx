By David R. Adler

Billed as "a jazz loft party," this animated live session is a memorial of sorts
to Malachi Favors, the original bassist in the Ritual Trio. Yosef Ben Israel
fills Favors' shoes while Ari Brown plays gruff tenor sax, Billy Bang guests on
violin and Kahil El'Zabar leads on kalimba, drum kit, congas and other
percussion. El'Zabar's three originals are built on extended modal vamps,
beginning with the Favors tribute "Big M" and continuing with the more
swing-based "Return of the Lost Tribe."

An irrepressible character, El'Zabar never hesitates to inject loud
vocalizations when the mood strikes; he spills into full-blown spoken-word on
the pep-talkish "Be Exciting (Kahil Testifies)." At times his emotionalism seems
jarring and forced, although it's not without its appeal. Brown's one
contribution, "Where Do You Want to Go?" is in fact the most compelling, with an
upbeat, syncopated groove that features Brown's steel-cable tenor sound at its
best. "Oof," the final track, opens with a meditative kalimba pattern and builds
through ecstatic statements from Brown and Billy Bang. Just before it ends,
El'Zabar resurrects the spirit of Favors once again, by rhythmically chanting
his name.
