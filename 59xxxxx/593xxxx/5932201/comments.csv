,osriccc,2011-02-23T02:15Z,Any rip without hardsubs and the super heavy file size? Anyway if there is not... this is the best.
,Atsaluum,2011-03-27T21:07Z,"These are NOT HARDSUBS. They are only forced, which means they override some player software default selection to not show the muxed subtitles. This seems to be perfect 1080p encode and the forced subs can easily be remuxed to be non-forced."
