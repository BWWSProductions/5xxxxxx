I M P O R T A N T   I N F O R M A T I O N

By using ImgBurn and selecting "Write image file to disc", these iso's can be burnt straight to DVD5 discs to be played back on any stand-alone, AVCHD compatible, Blu-ray or DVD-HD player, including PS3. Please note that regular DVD players are incapable of rendering Hi-Definition video, so they will NOT play these movies without re-encoding them.

Alternatively, if you want to stream the movies or watch them on your computer, PowerISO v4.5 or any later version can be used to extract the files and folders from the iso's. These are blu-ray/AVCHD iso's, not DVD iso's, so applications like WinRAR or MagicISO will NOT recognise them. The movie files themselves will be located in the BDMV/STREAM folders, and will be named "00000.m2ts". Once extracted, if you decide to save the movies by burning them onto a DVD5 disc, your ImgBurn settings need to be as follows:-

Click "Write files/folders to disc"
Add both the BDMV and CERTIFICATE folders
Select the Options Tab-
Data Type = MODE1/2048
File System = UDF
UDF Revision = 2.50
Make sure that the "Recurse Subdirectories" field IS checked, and all other fields are NOT checked.
Insert your DVD5 disc and click Burn.

The relevant codecs need to be installed to watch any HD movie on your computer. K-Lite's codec pack is free to download, but there are others.

The subtitles that are included with these releases are not forced, so as with any other HD video formats, they will NOT display if you watch the movies on your computer unless you add them externally.

Fair warning - Many computers will struggle to render Hi Def video smoothly unless they're up-to-date and/or fast, so if the movie is sluggish or out-of-sync, don't worry; it's your hardware, not us! (=

=====================================================================================

Your feedback is appreciated, so please rate our releases, and give back at least what you take - it's what keeps this alive.

Thanks and Enjoy!
