Hi - the torrent is on 'initial seed', so it will be a little slow until completed by a few others. The reason why you are seeing more than one seed is because the torrent has numerous trackers on peer exchange.

The upload is over 50% done now, so please be patient - it's not a small upload having four, 4.3+Gb movies in one.

Thanks

,hill877644,2010-11-10T15:52Z,yes these play on ps3 took 4 days to download well worth the wait to the uploader thanks ever so much
,thejoker8692,2011-01-23T07:58Z,Are these FAT32 compliant in size? I know they're a little over 4 gigs each. Like I have 1080p Avatar thats about 4.02GB and it'll transfer to my PS3. Was just wondering as to exact size and ability to transfer?
[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-24T15:51Z,"thejoker8692 - FAT32 has a maximum filesize of 4Gb, so no, not without using Media Server to transfer/stream, or by splitting the files."
,thejoker8692,2011-01-24T22:23Z,stupid FAT32 PS3 OS lol. 
,LAMBORGHINI38,2011-01-25T22:12Z,"this is not  a real untouch blue ray ,4 movies  minimum maybe is 150 gb in real blue ray without removing anything .Idont understund uploaders write in the infos that is a blue ray  and they trick the downloaders,i real blueray is hdma 24 bit 5.1 or 7.1  audio with bonus discs and multi audios  and multi subs ,and also uploaders have to give the choice to remove  audio and subs before downloading.also subs have to be including in the movie and not outside."
[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-26T19:52Z,"duh... ""Source.......: HD 1080p Bluray"" / Output is AVCHD.

If you want the original blu-ray disc, at it's original size, with all it's extras - go an buy it.

I love your downloads and the awesome quality and everything. Keep it up!
I have a request, could you please do the Predator series and the AVP series? It would be wonderful if you could.
I'm seeding all your downloads and good luck with future uploads!!!"
