Born in British India, Gunga Din always wanted to join the British army like many of his fellow Indians, but was not allowed to do so. So he starts observing them and learns accordingly. He befriends Sgt. Archibald Cutter, and warns him about a Thuggee uprising that may threaten their base. Sgt. Cutter and others are able to fend off the attack, but when Gunga gets information of a much larger rebel attack, Cutter accompanies him to the cult's temple embedded with gold statues of Hindu deities. Gunga finds out he is regarded as a traitor by his countrymen, and Cutter, as well as Sergeants MacChesney and Ballantine are held captive by the Thuggees in a bid to force the British to leave India.
