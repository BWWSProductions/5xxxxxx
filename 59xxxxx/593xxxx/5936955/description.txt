This textbook has been updated and extended to include recent research in all areas of everyday memory. The controversy about the value of naturalistic research, as opposed to traditional laboratory methods, is outlined, and the views of both critics and defenders are put forward. The trend toward convergence of the two approaches is evaluated.; This book brings together studies on many different topics such as memory for plans and actions, for names and faces, for routes and maps, conversations and stories, autobiographical experiences, and childhood events.
Further chapters focus on memory for general knowledge and for specialist domains such as music, chess, and computer programming. Emphasis is also given to memory for internal mental events such as thoughts and dreams. False memory syndrome, memory for health events, and social remembering are covered.; This new edition spells out the links between naturalistic and applied studies and the models, and theories that support them. It shows how theoretical frameworks such as schemas, scripts, mental models and production systems, and concepts such as encoding specificity, implicit memory and rule-based and case-based reasoning are needed to explain and interpret the findings and observations derived from the study of memory in the real world.......................
