,himansu_007,2010-11-03T05:57Z,"@Prashant

Hi I Hv A Request Plz Accept If Possible
Some Of These X264 Encoded Video Which Hv large resolutions Are Not playing Smoothly on my computer
I Think Its Because Of My 2.0 Ghz Processor (Not Dual Core) And It Is Not Possible 2 watch every movie in DVD Player

So Could u Just Less The Resolution A Little Bit 
It would Really Helpful Plz Do If U Can

Its Ok If U R Increasing The Video Or Audio Bit Reate"
[V],prashant22,2010-11-03T06:08Z,sorry himansu cant do that...its nt possible..
