Description
The man from Snowy River:
An ambitious rancher (Kirk Douglas) sets his sights on the 
hills of the awesome Snowy River country. Buried somewhere 
in that pristine wilderness, protected by treacherous terrain 
and bands of wild, stampeding horses, is a fortune in unmined 
gold. Before the rancher can stake his claim, however, his 
world is turned upside down when a cowboy steals his 
daughter's heart and uncovers a secret in those hills more 
precious than any treasure.
