I have shroo's rip and i downloaded the official patch and it worked fine. Game still loads up as if it was still cracked."
,bd201020,2010-11-08T17:35Z,"@ Ac1d69

 How did you get it to run? When I try to run the official patch it says unable to install. Any info would be appreciated.

Thanks"
,DABDA,2010-11-08T18:40Z,Works fine over Razor 1911's existing F1 2010 rip (Windows 7 x64).

,ac1d69,2010-11-09T03:27Z,"@ bd201020

Over at racedepartment.com (best place to get F1 2010 mods) they have the patch up unpacked to download so all you do is copy/paste the files into the F1 folder."
,gamerz2,2010-11-09T06:22Z,"@ac1d69
can you be more specific of the unpacked patch on racedepartment.com,like on which section of that page.By the way thank you so much for informing us about it."

who needs to download a 24mb patch from TPB when you can go to the damn website or fileplanet.

#1 do not trust anonymous.  anonymous is a prick.

,Mojo_66,2010-11-10T19:30Z,I can confirm that installing the official patch does not remove the crack.

,technogeek46,2011-06-14T21:30Z,Hey can anybody upload the origional F1 2010.exe as i can not install patch w/o it.
,Tsornta,2012-05-15T14:36Z,"Well... I was able to run the game with razor crack after installing this but the game itself had major performance issiues and i had to reinstall, it appears like the crack only ""seems"" to work. I was actually expecting this to happen, worthed a shot though... "
,Tsornta,2012-05-23T01:49Z,"Hmmm, it appears that it is the patch itself that is causing the issues, could depend on the machine... but the 1.00 crack seems to work fine indeed"
