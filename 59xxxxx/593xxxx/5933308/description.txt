Digital Tutors - Infiltrator Production Pipeline Volume 3: Rigging



In this course we will take the crab robot Justin has built and rig it to performance based off of the certain specifications.

We'll construct the control rig with a production focus. In the end, we will not only have worked with the rigging tools in Maya, but we'll also have looked into ways we can use some of those tools creatively to get the job done right and at a faster pace.
