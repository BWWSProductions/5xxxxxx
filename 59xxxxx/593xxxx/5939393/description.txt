TotalFinder is just a better Finder
TotalFinder works like the original Finder but adds tabs, dual panel, folders on top and other useful features.
TotalFinder works only with latest OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard).

Totalfinder 1.0.1 released on October 13, 2010
NEW Localized into Polish and Portugal. Thanks to translators, you rock!
NEW Introduced secret tweak TotalFinderDontTweakSidebar, to help folk having this issue.
FIXED Do not apply "Folders on Top" sorting on the desktop view. This should fix ghost icons on the desktop.
FIXED Fixed "Go To ..." keyboard shortcuts in Dual Mode (issue).
IMPROVED Registration Dialog is immune to extraneous whitespace characters.
IMPROVED In trial mode the window badge shows remaining days.
REMOVED Removed annoyance dialog which popped after every 10 tab switches. It was a bad idea


Type in any license details.


I have very slow Internet upload speed, so please be patient.
Please help continue seeding, cause I don't know how long and can keep this up by my own.
