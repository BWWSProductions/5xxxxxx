Sound 10/10
Video 10/10

PURE 100% Blueray

Totally worth the download."

,LiteSoul,2010-12-06T06:46Z,"I can only say 'WOW'.
I'm an avid downloader of movies, buy you really nailed HD-R-US. This plays perfectly on my PS3 (even the subs!), besides it's very relevant having AVCHD compliant vids today with all the media player boxes out there.
A bit thanks"
