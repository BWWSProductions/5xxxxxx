On July 17, the video for "My Dark Place Alone" premiered on ARTISTdirect.com, becoming their first single and video in eight years. The video jumps between images of the band covered in a black, oily substance, performing in a room soaked in the same substance, and images of an old man in a wheelchair and a black-eyed nurse, both dressed in white, in a white room.

Women and Children Last is the second studio album by American horror punk band Murderdolls released through Roadrunner Records on August 31, 2010. With the exception of Murderdolls touring guitarist Roman Surman, who contributed lead guitars to the album, and MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e guitarist Mick Mars, who makes guest appearances on the tracks "Drug Me to Hell" and "Blood-Stained Valentine", the album was recorded by Wednesday 13 and Joey Jordison. The album was produced by Chris "Zeuss" Harris. In an interview for Metal Hammer, Jordison explained why the old lineup would not be returning:
â€œ 	'The old band, we didnâ€™t even know each other before it all came together [...] It was dysfunctional but it worked, but this time, we wanted it to be a little more stable. It was apparent that if we were going to do The Murderdolls again, we were going to do it with everything weâ€™ve got.' 	â€

On June 17, 2010, on the Murderdolls Facebook page, the lead single from the album, titled "My Dark Place Alone", was available for full preview on Bloody-Disgusting.com. On June 22, the single was made available for free download, for 48 hours only, from the Roadrunner website. Mock film trailers were released for three of the album's nonsingle tracks, "Drug Me to Hell", "Summertime Suicide", and "Chapel of Blood".
