This package is ONLY for people that already have Hiren.BootCD9.5.PXEboot.1.0 on their system and want an update to 1.1 without redownloading all of 1.1.

IF YOU WANT THE FULL PACKAGE, SEARCH FOR "hiren netboot" ON DEMONOID (TPB screwed up and won't let me upload the torrent after I tried correcting the trackers, so I won't bother uploading it here for this release)

Extract to the same folder you originally extracted the files to, and overwrite all existing files. Nothing on the USB stick was updated.

Enjoy!
