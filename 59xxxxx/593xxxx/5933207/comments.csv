If you searching yourself music videos, let know."
[T],SgtRlee,2010-11-08T10:10Z,"I held off uploading more because i might be posting a video collection in the future for this band. 
I've been looking for a quality video for ""The Fixx - Red Skies"", the original version 1 live promo that was always played on the radio back then. I have a 320x240 video of it thats ok, but in mono, though it sounds pretty good."
