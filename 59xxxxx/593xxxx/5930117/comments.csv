[V],GoodFilms,2011-01-24T21:12Z,It freezes up for your because your software/hardware is not good enough.
,SkyNET84,2011-02-15T00:31Z,"To those who don't know; High definition files require significant power from your computer.

If you bought your computer in a box, chances are it won't play a 6 GB HD movie very well.

Don't leave comments about 'corrupted files' unless you actually know what you're talking about. 

Happy viewing!"

try using MPC from K-lite to play the file. Make sure you enable hardware acceleration/DXVA during installation. If you forgot to enable it, go to Option->Internal Filter, and tick H264/DXVA"
