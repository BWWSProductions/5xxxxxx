IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:The Other Guys  Russian dvd ..............Thanks UG
AUDIO:The Other Guys DVDSCR AC3 NTSC.... Abe Thanks Mate :) + Rx for the sync

Sorry we're late with this one and wall street... by damn work got in the way :lol: Anyway... for this we used the audio off the screener, but we borrowed Rx's already synced audio ( thanks guys ) as it saved time on us syncing it, and for the video we used the r5 dvdr that was released. Now the video we thought was ok for a r5 but by far not the best they've released... anyway we made a script and added white balance, sharpness, chroma, contrast, brightness, rgb eq to it and then dropped it in vdub to encode. The audio we just muxed to our encode afterwards.

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
