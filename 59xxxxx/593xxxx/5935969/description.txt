HQ very rare Bananas tv show promo music video from an outstanding and rare 1980's tv show from Germany, broadcasted from 1981 to 1984, this is practically unknown in America, but this show has very well known artists of the 1980's. 

The rarity of this show is that, all the appearances of very well known guests are a whole new promo music video production that easly could be considered as never seen before videos or second versions of several classic 80's videos.


"Thunder and Lightning" is a song from "Face Value", the debut solo album by then-Genesis front man Phil Collins, released in February 1981 on the Virgin label internationally and Atlantic Records in North America. Face Value became an immediate success, reaching number-one in the UK, Canada, and other European countries, while peaking at the top ten in the United States. Sales of the album reached five million alone in the United States and went five-times platinum in the United Kingdom and ten-times platinum in Canada. No solo tour was produced from this album and Collins wouldn't perform live on his own until 1982.
