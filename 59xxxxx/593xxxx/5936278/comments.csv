,halofubar,2012-04-21T19:02Z,"Somehow some of these are out of order, named wrong. Like in 2005 Someone in Control... Repeat Offender is the track you have to pick to listen to Lost Realist. There are more but I don't have time to go through them all."
,mabsousa,2012-06-26T19:01Z,"NEO no offense bro... You deserve some thankfullness for your ups...

But I would like to know why your 320kbps always sound the shittiest...
It might be your enconder or something.... Or you roll 128 into 320?
