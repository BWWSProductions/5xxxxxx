Thanks...."
,rawwww,2010-11-04T05:56Z,"i look forward to your torrents every week. do you have your own specific order of uploading which games?

i literally wait for the raiders tape every week and they seem to always come up close to last. :(

thanks again though."
,suninthefun3,2010-11-04T06:06Z,"I watched the previous 5 or 6 weeks with no problems, but for some reason this time around I can't get this one to play.  I use Divx and when I try the outcome is Divx player loading a black screen with no sound or video.  No errors associated with it.

Is anyone else having any trouble?  I forced a re-check to see if it would help but as you can see, here i am."
,suninthefun3,2010-11-04T06:42Z,"Alright... While Divx won't play it for some reason, VLC does."
[V],phatwarez,2010-11-04T07:15Z,"No order, when they're released I post them. They're a mix of my own games I record, and games other people upload to TYT. In the USA most people are stuck with what their local network (nbc, fox, cbs) will show so it depends on where people live. Not a lot of west coast games get posted because there just so happens to be very few uploaders living on the west coast.

The television system in the USA is much like most other things here-done via exclusive contracts that mostly benefit executives and wealthy shareholders. A lot of the time you simply cannot watch X team regardless of how much you pay your television provider. Us releasers are bound by the same restrictions."
