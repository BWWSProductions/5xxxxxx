       1/6 - Nature Knows Best
       Wallace and Gromit explore the wonders of the natural world and 
       look at inventions inspired by Mother Nature. We visit some 
       incredible flying penguins and other elegant Manta Ray-inspired 
       robots at Festo in Germany and visit Malawi, where scientists are 
       studying the intricate structures of termite mounds to create 
       self-cooling houses of the future.
       
       In Holland we meet the brilliant sculptor Theo Jansen as he shows 
       us his latest amazing contraption, the Animaris Siamesis - a huge 
       insect-like structure that moves independently and gracefully with 
       the wind. In Israel, Jem Stansfield meets a man who has invented a 
       fish-like 'gill' which could allow humans to breathe underwater 
       and we look at some weird and wonderful fly-eating furniture based 
       on the Venus Fly Trap plant and other carnivorous plants. Finally, 
       Wallace, with the help of his friend Goronwy, gives us a run-down 
       of his top five animal-inspired inventions.
