,Micke_Oi,2010-11-04T23:52Z,"1. Mounted the image (I tried burning it also)
2. Disconnect internet and installed the game.
3. Installed DirectX
4. Tried to run the game both with or without the crack but still don't work.

Have uninstalled and reinstalled 5 times but the same result.

Any tips?

It just freeze in one second, as soon as the window starts to load I get ""FM11 has stopped working""."

,NashornJg,2010-11-05T20:29Z,"HOW TO RUN PATCH ON THIS RUSSIAN VERSION:

1. Download FM patch: http://segaeu.vo.llnwd.net/o37/sec/fm2011/fm2011v11_1_0_pc_patch.exe?e=1288992142&h=9547c70b772b2b23e31651c0af33a7a0 (171MB)

2. Install patch
3. Download UltraISO and install (full activated version is necessary) http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5788037/UltraISO_Portable_9.3.6.2750_[FullVersion] (3MB) , or you can use any other ISO editor
4. Make sure that you unmounted FM2011 RU from Daemon
5. Open downloaded .iso in Ultra ISO (or any other ISO editor)
6. Rename disc name to FM2011 (so delete RU)
7. Save .iso
8. Mount in Daemon
9. Enjoy play with patched game! No more ,,Disc not found"" errors.

Its 100% working. 

Greetings from Slovakia."

,chivs688,2010-11-06T02:54Z,"Works perfectly, much appreciated.

However doesn't work when I updated it with the patch :/ 
When I patch it, it then asks for the disk when I start it up. If I use the Crack then it will then run fine, however when I select New Game, at the top it says Version 11.0, instead of 11.1 :/"

 3. Install the game (select offline version).
 4. Play the game.
 5. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT!

You only need to extract one of the WinRAR files. This will create a .iso file which you can mount."
,mufcfootball,2010-11-17T01:32Z,"you have to extract all the files in the folder they are downloaded in. just download WinRar, mark all the files with book icon, and ""extract here"". then use daemon tools to launch the game. it's really easy"

,HeAwayWasRight,2010-11-17T22:45Z,"OK guys it works follow my instructions.

1.Download the torrent file using Utorrent or whatever you use.

2.Make sure you download everything in the torrent all the rar files

3. When it's finished downloading click on the torrent then right click open containing folder

4.You should then see icons like a stack of books if not go to google and down the free program win rar if you already have win rar follow on


5.Click on the first rar file then right click then click open you should have a file saying rld-fb11 click on it then right click then click on Extract to the specified folder

6. Click the desktop icon then press ok it should then start putting the hole file together

7.When it's done download a free program called 
 PowerISO just google it install it then follow on.

8. Ok so you've got PowerISO installed now open the program click on the Mount icon then click on mount image to drive D it should open desktop up now find the file rld-fb11 it should say 2.53GB if it does good click on it then press open now go to start computer lick on CD Drive it should say FM11 good dubble click on it, it should ask you to install it i'm sure you'll be ok from there.

Good luck!"

,Maxosx,2011-01-09T00:22Z,"@canal06 yes this does work on a mac, I've used this torrent on mine (snow leopard). Instructions for mac users (without the need of cracks etc) 
1. Unrar the downloaded torrent to any location
2. open the folder and double click the .iso file inside 
3. Disk achiever should open it and convert/run it as a .dmg
4. In the box that opens, double click ""launch installer"" and install to directory
5. IMPORTANT: DO NOT CLICK ACTIVATE BY STEAM, SELECT THE OPTION WHICH MAKES YOU INSERT YOUR [nonexistent] DISK EACH TIME YOU WANT TO PLAY
6. Finish the installation. You can now launch it from your app folder
7. DO NOT delete the file you unrared - this acts as the [virtual] disk and will fool the software into thinking you have inserted the DVD. As long as you wish to play the game, always ensure that the iso file in the unrared folder is launched. You can delete the files the torrent downloaded - as you already have the decompressed version. 

Ask if you need help ;)"

2. Go to the rld-fb11 file, Install via ""setup""
3. Mount the FM iso file (should be in the Football.Manager.2011.PROPER-RELOAD file, the file is called rld-fb11) via Daemon Tools

Some of you may be getting a message like the one below while launching a Telltale game:



If so, then you need to run the DirectX Updater again:

DirectX Web Updater
- Computer must be on the Internet when running this update.

OR

DirectX Off-line Updater
- Computer does not need to be on the Internet to run this update, but it's a 93+mb file.

They both do the same thing. The first one requires the Internet to download files at install time, the other one has all the files you need up front.

Details to what's happening:

Telltale games require more recent DirectX updates than what's originally included in Windows XP, Vista, and 7. To combat this, I include the DirectX Web updater with the game's install program. Microsoft doesn't include DirectX as apart of Windows Update, I have to resort to using the web installer at install time.

However, this requires the computer to be on the Internet at installation time. Otherwise it's an extra 100MB per episode. So if the Internet isn't there, then DirectX isn't updated. I wish there was an easier way about this!

For reference, the season DVDs do and will continue to have the off-line version of the DirectX updater on the DVD.

,darknik341,2011-10-26T00:21Z,"Here's a detailed guide to make this work. You don't need to mount anything so don't bother with that. Note that this will ask for a cd since it doesn't include a crack...

1. Download winrar. When installing make sure to check the box that says .iso when asked for what files should winrar handle. Here's the download link for winrar: 
http://download.cnet.com/WinRAR-32-bit/3000-2250_4-10007677.html?tag=rb_content;main 

2. Go to the folder you downloaded the game and double click any of the books that appear, winrar will launch, select extract to and choose desktop, wait till its done, create a new folder on your desktop and name it whatever you want, double click the new book that appears on desktop and extract to the folder you created. When it's done go to the folder you created and double click setup. Make sure to check offline installation and not the one that says steam.

3. If you get an error when you launch the game, update your direct x from the official microsoft website only!! Here's the link:
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=35
if not exit the game since it will ask for a cd and go to step 4.

4. Download this torrent which has the latest game patch and a crack. Here's the link:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6230578/Football.Manager.2011.v11.3.0.UPDATE-OUTLAWS

5. Go to the downloaded folder, install the game patch first!! then copy the other file that's left (don't remember the name :P) , go to computer  c:/program files/sports interactive/football manager 2011
and paste there, make sure to replace it with the existing one...

6. Delete all the files and folders you downloaded or created if you don't need them, the files needed to make the game work are at c:/program files/sports interactive/football manager 2011

7. Enjoy the game :)"
