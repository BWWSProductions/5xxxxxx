,wizpig64,2011-01-03T21:38Z,"This isn't the full book, sadly. However, the first chapter included (a great move on the publisher's part, btw) should get me by until my book arrives from amazon :)"
,jfr5dh,2011-01-20T16:58Z,you wouldn't happen to have the full ebook would you?
,fatetard,2011-02-27T02:41Z,I do not have the full text book.  Don't you think that I would have included it in this torrent if I did?
