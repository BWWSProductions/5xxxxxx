"In Re: Kelvin Jones"  

When a gang shooting leaves a student 
dead at the Cyrus Garza School, Garza 
(Jimmy Smits) decides to file a 
lawsuit against the school for 
creating an atmosphere that led to the 
child's death. However, as Garza 
realizes the extent of the school 
system's segregation, it is up to him, 
Al (David Ramsay) and Mereta (Ellen 
Woglom) to file a class action to 
force the school district to finally 
desegregate the schools. Meanwhile, 
Eddie (Jesse Bradford) has to decide 
if he can trust Lucinda (Carly Pope) 
when she becomes the prime suspect in 
Buzzcut's murder.

Enjoy :)
