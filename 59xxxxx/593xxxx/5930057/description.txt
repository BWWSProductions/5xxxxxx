    On his seventeenth birthday, Michael is given a present of a Ouija       
    board by Tony his best friend. At a session, Tony using a medium         
    known to him only as "Virgil", unwittingly unlocks the evil forces of    
    the board. Soon there is a wave of violent killings and the chief        
    suspect appears to be Michael. He has been witness to all the            
    killings via premonitions and out of body experiences. Is Michael the    
    killer? Can he prove his innocence or is someone else being possessed    
    by the evil spirit...?
