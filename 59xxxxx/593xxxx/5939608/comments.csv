Michael Straczynski[2] and penciled by Shane Davis.[3] Published in the US in 2010 by DC Comics, and in the UK in 2011 by Titan Books, Superman: Earth One is the inaugural title of the new ongoing OGN series DC: Earth One, which, similarly to the Ultimate Marvel universe, allows creators to tell stories free of cumbersome continuity and reintroduce classic characters for a new generation."
