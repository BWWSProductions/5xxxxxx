I decided not to take a chance and deleted Chess 3D. It's your call."

,acenoise,2011-09-02T06:46Z,Avg detects the keygen as a virus and removes it!
,blackestsheep,2012-07-03T04:37Z,"thanks works  fine
avg anti virus will delete the keygen so turn avg off before u install
the keygen is totally legit..it gives u the  username and serial so u can play the whole game otherwise its restricted to only 20 moves..its tested and working fine
