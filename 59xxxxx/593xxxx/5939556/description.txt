Herein lies a set of modern (recent), DDD recordings of Rachmaninov's piano concertos. The contents come from two CD's:

 * Piano Concerto 2 & 3 - Simon Trpceski and Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra (Petrenko)

 * Piano Concerto 3 & Rhapsody on Theme of Paganini - Jon Nakamatsu and Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra (Seaman)

These recordings may not live up to the classics, but they are technically fine performances and the sound quality is very good (to me at least, some audiophiles may have even higher standards)




Encoded in FLAC compression-level 5.


**Tagging is done as follows:
Artist == Composer
Album == Name of the work
Title == Title of a part or movement in a work
Genre == The performer(s)
Track == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.

I've done filenames as "%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title"


If there are any skips or pops in the files that I have missed, please comment and I will fix and upload that piece.
