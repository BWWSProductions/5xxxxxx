It is of your own free will that the Maker lets you choose. There is never pressure from Good side to join them, only the evil side will rush you to a decision. You don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have to try to change if you don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t want, just admit you are a sinner and that you need the grace and the Blood of Jesus, to be forgiven so that you may live in Eternal Heaven instead of Eternal hell fire. The choice is yours, say the sinners prayer and live with Jesus forever.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Sinners Prayer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"..........................
        Heavenly Father:..........................................................................
I come to you in prayer asking for the forgiveness of
my Sins.  I confess with my mouth and believe with my
heart that Jesus is your Son, And that he died on the
Cross at Calvary that I might be forgiven and have
Eternal Life in the Kingdom of Heaven.  Father, I believe
that Jesus rose from the dead and I ask you right now
to come in to my life and be my personal Lord and
Savior. I repent of my Sins and will Worship you all the
day\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s of my Life!. Because your word is truth, I confess
with my mouth that I am Born Again and Cleansed
by the Blood of Jesus!   In Jesus Name, Amen.

                       If you read the Sinners Prayer and truely believe the words you read, then
Praise the Lord as you have been saved and your name will appear in the
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Lambs Book of Life!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"................................................... and you are now eligble for the RAPtURE talked about below. Pretty simple huh???

RAPtURE  (My transportation outta here.)

there is nothing more preposterousness in Christianity than the RAPtURE, there is also nothing more tRUE in the Bible than the RAPtURE. the Great Escape. Sign up now!!!

The Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross, paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice, Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him... 

May Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.
