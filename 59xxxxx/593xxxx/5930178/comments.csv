,hauntnut,2010-11-09T05:58Z,Have your files been tested on a PS3? Just want to make sure it will play on my system before I download. Thanks!

Sony PS3 is an AVCHD compatible blu-ray player, so yes, it will play the DVD5 disk if you burn it, but as a file, PS3 will only read files up to 4Gb in size because of it's ridiculous FAT32 limitations - this can be upgraded, or you can extract the movie and stream it from your network server."

Why are you looking for DVD folders when this is a HD blu-ray iso? Perhaps you should read the torrent's notes before posting stupid comments."
