1. your xbox 360 needs to be modded to play burned/back up games.

2. if it is modded (depends which method) try using a wave 4 activation disc (for flashed xboxs) my xbox360 has a flashed samsung drive, i use a wave 4 activate disc to play my backed up kinect games (and all my other back up games)

3. if you dont know what an activation disc is you seriously need help... "
