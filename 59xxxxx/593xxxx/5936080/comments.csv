,NashornJg,2010-11-05T20:31Z,"HOW TO RUN PATCH ON RUSSIAN VERSION:

1. Download FM patch: http://segaeu.vo.llnwd.net/o37/sec/fm2011/fm2011v11_1_0_pc_patch.exe?e=1288992142&h=9547c70b772b2b23e31651c0af33a7a0 (171MB)

2. Install patch
3. Download UltraISO and install (full activated version is necessary) http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5788037/UltraISO_Portable_9.3.6.2750_[FullVersion] (3MB) , or you can use any other ISO editor
4. Make sure that you unmounted FM2011 RU from Daemon
5. Open downloaded .iso in Ultra ISO (or any other ISO editor)
6. Rename disc name to FM2011 (so delete RU)
7. Save .iso
8. Mount in Daemon

,Milan0vic,2010-11-05T23:21Z,"@AlbaGuBrath:

Okay, i've done everything you've said but FM still won't recognise the dutch.ltf file that came with the GLOBE download. I already tries to change it into a *.ltc but FM still doesn't recognise it.
I've already reinstalled FM four times, and the installation went smoothless. 
Your help is being appreciated,"
[V],AlbaGuBrath,2010-11-06T00:08Z,"@ NashornJg  THANK YOU!! im sure that is a great help to a lot of the people that are having issues!!

@ Milan0vic I never d/led the GLOBE version, i d/led the P2p Russian version, this is what i done to get mine to work!! (and i just checked i can change the language on mine) 
I didnt have to uninstall then reinstall, i run the update and it updated as it should, then i renamed my ISO to FM2011(removed the RUS) i didnt use the crack that came with this, then i just mounted and played the game as normal!!
Im not sure if that will be of much help to you, sorry, but that is what i have done and im playing the updated game now!!

@ fomuss you need a seperate update for the MAC you need the .dmg file

@ KingUnitedlolol Hi, rename your iso, not just by right clicking and selecting rename, but use your software(i use powerISO) to open it and actually rename the ISO then save and then remount!!"

,frame1962,2010-11-08T14:11Z,Will this work on the Russian version with the Russian patch instead of the normal patch?
,Furrr87,2010-11-09T09:40Z,"I think i have found the solution, it worked with my version (downloaded the russian version) but i think its for all versions.
Before! i installed the patch i deleted all the files in the data/language folder.
Then i put the old .ltc file, not the ltf file in the language folder.
So (in my position) i deleted the dutch.ltf file (around 34mb) and put the old dutch.ltc (around 26mb) in the folder.
The installed the patch, copyd the crack over the original fm.exe.
Started the game and it was in dutch.
I think this also works for other languages.

So:
1: deleted all(!) files in the data/languages map
2: put 'old' .ltc (new patch doenst recognize .ltf files) of the desired language
3: install patch
4: copy crack
5: run game

Note: i already installed the patch on my PC so i couldnt get my dutch.ltc to work, so i tried it on my latop as writen above and that worked.
Sooo if you have installed the patch already i think than there is a problem, cus accoring to my knowlegde you cant uninstall the patch.
So if you want it to work and play with version 11.1.0 and your langauge and you have already installed the patch you have to deinstall fm(save your current game on a usb) install fm again and then follow steps above.

Hope it works!
let me know."
,kriz89,2010-11-11T09:12Z,"@Furrr87: what do you mean by ""old"" .ltc?u mean the original ltc or fm10 ltc?mind explaining?thanx"
,Furrr87,2010-11-11T09:16Z,"For example:
The .ltc that was in the demo
Or the .ltc files that were in the first language packs.
Thing is: the 11.0 version didnt work properly with .ltc files so u need to use a .ltf file.
But the 11.1 version doenst reconigze a .ltf file
Soo use the .ltc"
