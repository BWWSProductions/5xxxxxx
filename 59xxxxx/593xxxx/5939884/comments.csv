,Cleanasawhistle,2011-03-08T09:19Z,"Mohamad93 - you're wrong it doesn't mess up iPhoto, you just need to update software after installation."
,yupitsme86,2011-10-18T03:12Z,"Works Great! Just had to run software update to update iLife 11' for Lion. I also wanted to let future seeders know that if during the registration process you are asked to provide a marketing part number, here's what you type in. The marketing part number for the single-user package is MA790Z/A, and for the family pack it is MA791Z/A. Hope this helps."
,tdiamante,2012-05-17T22:59Z,I really want to thank-you for taking the time to share this with everyone. It's awesome that you take time out of your life to make our's better without being asked. unselfishly. Anyone that complains probably have never uploaded a thing in their life.
