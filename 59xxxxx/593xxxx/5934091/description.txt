Also joining Deadline in the second hour is Oracle Broadcastings own Doug Owen. I discovered his show 'Black Listed News Radio - Intel Strike' when our own Jack Blood was on just after his announced switch from Rense Radio to Oracle. Good show, good dude. Check 'em out.

I've started my own project involving the show. That being a re-stream of the latest show during the week. On the weekends I'm 
hoping to have replays from the entire week plus interviews with recent guests. You can find the stream @:
