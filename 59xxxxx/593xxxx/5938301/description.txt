Tricia Oaks is too proud. She has a perfect body but when you see her on the streets you can tell she knows it. Cyd Black has never liked women like that. They think they are better than everyone and the world owes them a favor just for existing. That kind of shit may fly for weaker men, but Cyd is going to show this bitch where she belongs. 

The bondage is as simple as it is effective. He does not waste a lot of time making elaborate knots because they do not serve a purpose. He wants Tricia to learn a bit of humility and being bound and humiliated is only part of that lesson. The pain he inflicts will teach faster. The marks will give her something to study in the future. As the tight bondage makes her limbs begin to change colors Cyd finds even more ways to make her suffer. The tears just confirm his message is getting through.
