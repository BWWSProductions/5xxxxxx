I don't see it anywhere else?"
,axero,2010-11-06T18:23Z,"Nvmd found it, looks real :P"
,axero,2010-11-06T18:24Z,"Now, where's that shaun white crack! :P"
[V],alexisthebest,2010-11-06T20:58Z,"@DMA_atall

No problem

@axero
it's real haha

And i'll be sure to post the crack if it comes out and nobody has already uploaded it :]"
,biggblack86,2010-11-09T05:17Z,so whats the difference between this patch and the crack for 1.4.1??
[V],alexisthebest,2010-11-09T13:31Z,"@biggblack86

It's essentially the same thing by the looks of it.

I would suggest just stick with this or the other RELOADED patch to avoid any errors or possibly viruses."
,immuno,2010-12-06T12:34Z,"For some reason went unrar this to the install directory I get a long list of errors from WinRAR Diagnostic - esssentially they all say access is denied. Could someone help me out with this?

Cheers"
,DeerPark6180,2010-12-06T15:26Z,"I have this and patch v1.41, But I don't even know how to install this. Is installation directory Program Files for XP users? I would think so. And if I unrar it how do I get past the missing DLL message? It tells me to reinstall it to fix it.
Long story short, can someone give a step by step install process for dummies on this and the patch? "
,mic_co,2010-12-08T23:11Z,Hate to be dumbass but i don't get how should i install this cause this is the first time i download torrent like this...thanks...
[V],alexisthebest,2010-12-10T02:11Z,"@mic_co

it's fine, it was one of my first uploads so i hadly knew what i was doing.

Just select all the rar archives, right click the first one and then select extract here. it'll extract 3 folders, and you move those into your borderlands game folder and over right.

If you have any more questions, feel free to ask"
,toxegaju,2010-12-13T01:04Z,"got a problem... i put this on my install directory,but when try to log ong, it says that i have to update my game.. isn't this the last one?"
,toxegaju,2010-12-13T01:06Z,"got a prob... i put this os the install directory, but when trying to log in, it says that i have to update the gamr... isn't this the last one?"
[V],alexisthebest,2010-12-13T08:43Z,"@toxegaju

not sure what the issue could be, but yes, this is the newest patch as far as i know."
,blasimir,2010-12-29T22:32Z,Will installing this patch delete my saved chars?
,EndGamer,2011-01-03T16:50Z,"yah i cant get this to work right. im using the cracked version of the game from on here given by razor, and that works fine, but when i try and install this patch the game wont run anymore as if i never cracked it to begin with.

think you could throw a guy some instructions on how to do it right?"
,Millerdis100,2011-01-10T20:23Z,"When i'm copy and paste this to game directory then do i have to replace the files when it asks or not? And same question for installing dlc's, do i need to replace the files?

And do i need to get all the patches or just the latest one (1.4.1)?

I have reloaded version game that i have already installed and all dlc's that im not yet pasted to directory because i'm kinda confused with this patching :D"
,yuppy989,2011-01-15T09:10Z,Can we use this patch with the Proper-Razor1911 version? Can we use any of the RELOADED patches with the Razor1911?
,Matei4321,2011-01-30T15:45Z,"Thank you very much. I have installed it and it is functioning perfectly.

Multumesc mult. L-am instalat si functioneaza perfect."
,Handsome_Hawk,2011-02-03T13:06Z,"Will try this out, looks like an awesome game :D"
,GiveNothingBack,2011-02-20T18:46Z,"Guys, check out this version:

,Banzay27,2011-03-08T00:39Z,"Downloaded this and the Claptrap DLC. Installed DLC, override the files lastly with this patch and the game seems to run just fine.
Thanks, alex."
,Backitup,2011-03-18T18:48Z,"Yeah, I do own the game there ""alexisthebest,"" and there is a very legitimate reason for cracks being available. Don't assume that all of us downloading these cracks don't actually own the game.

Sometimes we have to resort to crap like this because of the @- #*!$ that give such ridiculous DRM's we can't even use the user licenses we purchase from them.

I'm downloading this crack because I'm sick and freaking tired of spending hours getting this )@^^ game working all because Securom keeps blocking the Borderlands.exe file for some unknown reason. It's been over 8 months since I bought this game, and I haven't even seen the start-up screen yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,Backitup,2011-03-18T18:51Z,"Remember it people, 2K Games and Gearbox, see if their games are even worth spending months to finally get working legitimately before you actually buy them, or screw yourself over like I did and have to download the crack anyway."
,NeroAkira,2011-03-20T01:05Z,"I should kick your ass, admittidly you have been helpful, but, now i cant even play the damn game, i did exactly as you told people to do and now ima have to install it all over again, I SHOULD REALLY KICK YOUR ASS, and all i wanted to do was play on fucking line"
,NeroAkira,2011-03-20T01:10Z,"This is gonna be hard but, I am very sorry for my vulgar remarks, i am an utter nincumpoop, i forgot to move the new .exe into the file i realized this after i commented i did this and online now works game works, i am very sorry and thank you."
,61stylo,2011-03-20T10:28Z,I fucking hate it when people release shit in rars.
,ShadoxBlade,2011-04-04T04:27Z,"Created an accound just for this torrent....
IF YOU HAVE AN ERROR MESSAGE THAT SAYS something to the effect of...""YOUR COMMON.USF IS FUCKED."", THIS FIXES IT. sorry for the caps, but i downloaded 12Gs@100KB/s for this game and it was broken...when i downloaded this, it was fixed. cudos to alex :)))"
,ShadoxBlade,2011-04-11T00:31Z,"Hey, every time i try to teleport to Jakobs Cave or The Underdome (and i assume all the other DLC areas), the game crashes. I would appreciate it a ton if you could help, thanks."

,n1ng4,2011-04-24T06:37Z,@61sylo. just extract it. the file would be much bigger if it wasnt compacted and it would take longer to download

,xads308,2011-04-26T01:48Z,"my friends have a cidered version of borderlands for their macs. i bought the GOTY edition for my PC and was successful in using cracks so i can play with them. however, i would really like to play the DLCs i paid for, yet still be able to play with them. will this 1.41 crack let me play the DLC, yet play with them (i assume they're using 1.00 or 1.0.1)?"
,404ninja,2011-05-20T02:59Z,"What do I do with the files that aren't in rars? For example, rld-bl41.r30 through 41"
,NevaMynde,2011-08-03T09:25Z,"@404ninja
Chances are that they are indeed RAR files. Probably just doesnt have an icon assoicated with them - winRAR only makes file associations for the first 30x (.r00 - .r29)."
