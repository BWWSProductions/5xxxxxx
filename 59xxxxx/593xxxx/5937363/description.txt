Came across this cool windows widget, that allows you to have exactly the same flip clock/weather widget as seen on HTC Android phones.

It works on both 32 & 64 bit Windows 7 and has a few customisable features.

I find this a much clearer gadget/widget to read and is better than most of the normal windows ones you can find.

You can also check it out at Codeplex (home page):
