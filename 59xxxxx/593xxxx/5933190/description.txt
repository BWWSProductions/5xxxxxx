Golden Earring - When the Lady Smiles [promo].VOB



HQ rare promo music video. "When the Lady Smiles" is a 
1984 song by Dutch band Golden Earring. It was the first single from their 
album N.E.W.S. (NorthEastWestSouth). Following their top 10 "Twilight Zone", 
"When the Lady Smiles" was a U.S. chart disappointment, only reaching #76 on 
The Billboard Hot 100 chart. With a total of 5 "Hot 100" releases, Golden 
Earring are by far the most successful Dutch band on the international charts.

The video for this song, shot by Dick Maas, was controversial. In one scene, 
a man attempts to rape a nun. This particular scene was quickly removed from 
the video (the full cut was only shown after midnight). The bold video may 
have hurt the sales of the single in the New World, although it climbed to 
number 3 position in the charts in Canada. In The Netherlands, however, 
"When the Lady Smiles" became Golden Earring's fifth number one.
