@l30tse - It works fine on mine. It did get out of sync but I just had to restart the player. Played on 3.4Ghz Dual Core Pentium D with 2gb ram Intel 94Gz express Video"

,RickyTheFish,2011-04-04T14:40Z,"The movie is broken. It doesn't work in Windows Media Player at all and crashes VLC. The screens look good, but that doesn't mean anything if the video doesn't play. I recommend finding another copy.

Thanks for the upload deffjam555, but it doesn't work for me."
