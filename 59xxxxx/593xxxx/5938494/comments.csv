,SlamminSam2129292,2010-11-08T23:02Z,It works and patches it when its checked but when I uncheck it still says stealth is uncertain???
,SlamminSam2129292,2010-11-08T23:13Z,Mine jus said YOU MUST UPDATE YOUR ABGX 360 to V1.0.3 and after i had it checked with this files and extracted them to the desktop and then unchecked them it said BASIC STEALTH CHECK PASSED! DOES THAT MEAN IM OK TO PLAY ONLINE!?!?!?
,drunknecro,2010-11-09T00:21Z,patched to ssv2 for me works fine but it wont stealth pass yet because its not verified by abgx yet to someone who made comment bout it stealth passing thats just a lie 
,SlamminSam2129292,2010-11-09T01:37Z,So Hey yeah i know i redid it and it said stealth still not passed whatever... DO you think WILL IT BE PASSED TONIGHT BY MIDNIGHT??? or is this copy if I SSV2 it and make a copy now (like I did and it works fine) and wait till midnight to play it will I be ok to play it.. yes or no?? I wanna play it tonight 
,SlamminSam2129292,2010-11-09T01:40Z,yeah my bad about that comment... just wondering if I need to wait for ABGX to say its stealth passed them make a copy( and 1. will that be tonight at midnight?) and 2. IF i already made a copy (which I already did) can I just wait till midnight and play the copy i jus made and its now SSv2 and not get banned is this correct?
,iskotheking,2010-11-09T12:25Z,can somebudy tell me what ssv2 dose and stand for ?
,NCG33K,2010-11-09T18:50Z,Works abgx says SSv2 now thanks
