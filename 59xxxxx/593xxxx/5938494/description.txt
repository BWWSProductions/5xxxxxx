The SSv2 patch files for Call of Duty: Black Ops games that are SSv1.

This download does not contain the game download (obviously, as seen from the file size).

Use ABGX360 to see if your .iso is SSv1. If it is, go to "Manually Patch or Extract Files" tab.

Checkmark "Patch DMI" and "Patch SS". Then select where the files are located (from this download, the "BO DMI.bin" and "BO SS.bin" files), then click "Launch". It will check it, then will patch it.

After you are finished, you can then uncheck the Patching boxes and then "Launch" it again just to verify that it worked.

Good Luck.
