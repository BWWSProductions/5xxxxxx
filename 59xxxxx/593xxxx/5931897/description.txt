We still like the old DivX 6 player downloadable on the net (ignore
the "out of date" signs that sometimes come up when you use it)
as it shows a great picture (compared to vlc certainly) and as well
Windows 7 has a nice media player built in too.

We converted this movie file from 720p HD to standard DivX player format
for those of you whose Disc players may not be HD capable as yet.

That said, it produced a remarkaby nice picture to use 720p source material
and we included 192k audio . The video file is a 720 X 404 as converted by
the industry standard DivX plus converter, which we use here exclusively 
for this purpose.

This is a an excellent production, directed by (and screenplay) Wolfgang Petersen
From a novel by Lothar G. Buchheim 

Starring: JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, Herbert GrÃ¶nemeyer and Klaus Wennemann 

Despite being a British schoolboy myself, I did not perceive I was on the wrong
side at any time while watching this movie - as a German patriot too!!!!!

Its a great thrill for all of British stock as it were and that includes
the best of our folks in the UK certainly, along with our family in Germany!

Its a long way to Tipperrary, but my heart waits there too!

We will soon have an enhanced "Sound of Music" for standard DivX players
around 1.5GB with dual English - German audio from a fresh conversion
