,bhylls,2010-11-04T11:26Z,many many thanks for this excellent production probably one of the most realistic accounts of u boat warfare(except for the silly ending) I dearly wish that I could get hold of the original as shown on german tv which I believe was about 8 hours long none the less many thanks

We hope to follow up with an HD version quite soon, we are presently converting a 1080p bluray version of The Sound of Music for all to enjoy. It took us 1hr to download it on the net with our 50mb speed download server. We have plans to provide one version with German audio too."
