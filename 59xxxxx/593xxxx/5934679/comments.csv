Hey, why don't you give credit where credit is due?

This is my work!

AMJ"
[V],froggie100,2010-11-05T10:53Z,"there no credit or no name mentioned in any nfo or release title.... so  only credit i can give is to ""chr"" 

"
[T],SnowCrash05,2010-11-05T11:37Z,"Hi mate anycomponents removed?is it will run on old pc,i belive the requirement is low. Thanks matey!"
,angrymobjustice,2010-11-05T13:05Z,"@froggie100:

You just ""cut and paste"" most of the description from the my Demonoid post but you conveniently left out ""by AMJ"".

Other have upped my work here and given me credit.  I have no prob with them!

You are just trying to pretend this is yours.
WTF is ""CHR""?

AMJ"
,angrymobjustice,2010-11-05T13:08Z,"@ Umbrella tears:

Yes, there are plenty of components removed but froggy wouldn't know since he didn't create this...I did.

Yes, it will run nice on older PC's.

,angrymobjustice,2010-11-06T14:29Z,"Why is the a ""crack"" included?

DAZ loader runs at post install.

Deny me credit all you want ""froggy"", but the end user will see it was me who created this OS and you will look like an idiot."
,GaMeR2K5,2010-11-07T01:13Z,"Downloaded this a couple of days ago from Torrentleech... and installed it on my netbook tonight. 

Works like a charm so far. :)

Creds to CHR... good work"
,angrymobjustice,2010-11-07T04:39Z,"Who the hell is ""CHR""?

This is my work.  Read the ""READ ME"" on the desktop.

It clearly says ""AMJ"", short for angrymobjustice.

There are plenty of Demonoid users who can verify this.

,GaMeR2K5,2010-11-07T11:15Z,"@angrymobjustice:

CHR is a releasegroup... and I can't find any other information anywhere. 

The NFO says CHR. 

If anything else is hidden somewhere to be shown only AFTER installation that's just plain stupid. xD"
,angrymobjustice,2010-11-07T23:21Z,"I'm stupid?

I am the one to made this!

How many modded OS's have you made, gamerdouche?"
[V],froggie100,2010-11-08T14:10Z,"angrymobjustice
if you made next time tag the your name ""amj"" in the title...."
[V],DeGun,2010-11-08T20:55Z,"once again unhappy people from froggie ... 

pink skull on its way huh ? fancy that ? behave urself  I ALREADY WARNED YOU AND ASKED YOU TO ACT AS A VIP SHOULD ACT and again there is some to say about your behaviour . 

last of last time . got it ? "
,GaMeR2K5,2010-11-08T23:01Z,"@angrymobjustice: No, I didn't call you stupid. I wrote ""If anything else is hidden somewhere to be shown only AFTER installation that's just plain stupid.""

So if YOU really compiled this modded version, how come there's no info about that whatsoever anywhere... except for after an install? 

As I said, the NFO and TITLE says ""CHR"". 

And I have made a couple of mods myself, but none that I have published. But if I would do that I should make sure to make clear who made it, just like the other releasegroups and folks do. "
,jester_msc,2010-11-09T01:19Z,i'm having trouble getting this onto a bootable usb. everytime i try to use the eze boot software it either erases my flash drive or does nothing. not sure what i'm doing wrong. any ideas?
,angrymobjustice,2010-11-09T02:15Z,"@GaMeR2K5:

I did add my name in the title and it was changed (CHR was added by ???) There are hundreds of users on Demonoid who can vouch for me.

My name is inside there in the ""READ ME"" file.  Did you even bother to look?

@Froggy:

All I asked for was some acknowledgment.  Is it really that difficult?  I'm glad you got your pee pee slapped! 

AMJ
"
,GaMeR2K5,2010-11-09T14:29Z,"@angrymobjustice:

You're clearly missing the point.

Well I've seen this torrent on a bunch of torrent-sites now and they all say ""CHR"". 

Who cares if there's a *.txt-file on the desktop which can only be read AFTER an install?  

Creds go to the one mentioned in the torrent-content like the TITLE or NFO-file. 

END OF DISCUSSION (at least from my side)"
,angrymobjustice,2010-11-10T05:27Z,"@GaMeR2K5:

If you think that what is INSIDE the ISO is less important than whatever someone decides to rename the files then you are clearly retarded.

Anyone can change the name of file.  You cant change what is contained in the WIM.

Duh..."

,angrymobjustice,2010-11-11T06:12Z,"@borgixx:

""Grub"" is a Linux bootloader.  Did you have a Linux OS installed on this previously?

If so, you probably didn't format completely and left the Grub intact.  It is trying to find Linux and all it's finding is the NFTS formatted Windows.

Do a complete wipe first and reinstall."
,auximenes,2010-11-14T10:11Z,Stop hating on froggie. What do you do for the scene? He has helped millions of people. LONG LIVE THE PIRATE BAY 
,s3nr1,2010-11-27T07:59Z,anyway to remove the OSX stuff ? The not so obvious stuff are downright ugly. So is the shutdown screen.
,PrincePwn,2010-11-30T18:02Z,"@angrymobjustice
You made the OS???? It was Microsoft you dumb fuck. You lost all credibility when you said you made it. You made MODIFICATIONS to it, you did not MAKE it."

,edmondt,2010-12-10T18:07Z,"This OS is awesome! I've installed it on a HTPC and I'm loving it! Its really fast and snappy...

Only a few things which are not working hopefully someone can help:

- File Sharing (I can connect to other shares)
- .NET stuff throws ""Problem Event Name:	CLR20r3"" error (I think it has to do with .NET 2 maybe)
- Cannot get TV listings from Media Center, It is stuck at downloading listing)

If I can figure these out then I will not have to uninstall! :D"
,zenmonky,2010-12-16T16:10Z,"this is angrymobjustices modded os.  its incredibly fast and doesnt have the bugs that the other lited 7's had.  its faster than lited xp.  amj got me off the xp for good.  i put it on all computers that come my way.

froggy, you should change the release notes to give amj credit.  he did a lot of work, its not just a regular lited 7 junk release.  give the dog a bone"

Thanks for makin this os, i have downloaded it from demonoid and it's definitely your's(Some retard's were arguing about ur name not being in the NFO,but it's there in the README which is more reliable!!).

Thx to froggie100 for the up on TPB"

,brownkity,2011-01-04T03:57Z,Thanks!!! I'm gonna seed for as long as I have this file on my laptop. 
,brownkity,2011-01-04T04:02Z,"I could bypass entering the prod key by skipping it (duh) and I faced no problems b/c it loads an app right after installation 2 activate win7. 
It is win7, but amj just did a load of mods, and made it nice. 
I wouldn't have even thought of changing the startup sound if I didn't hear that music
For the those who want to dwnld resource hacker, open computer/c/windows/system32/imageres.dll right click imageres.dll (imageres.dll is the actual file) and grant admin full control (that's what allowed me 2 edit the files in sys32. I did trial and error, b/c I didn't do that @ 1st.)
open it in resource hacker and 
drop down wave, 
5080, 
1033 
right click 1033. 
replace resource... 
open with new resource... 
(choose a wav format song. It has 2 b in wav format) 
Resource type WAVE 
resource name: 5080 
resource language: 1033 and 
Replace 
file 
save. 

it saves this as the current one, and saves imageres_original as well, just in case you want 2 switch back. I had to allow administrative editing of the file before I could change anything in the sys32 folder. I had tried saving it outside of sys32 and did the whole process first, but it didn't work, and when I allowed administrative access to those files, I could save. If it allows you to save the file in sys32, it worked. if you get an error, it didn't change anything. 
You'll see the two files anyway if you got it right. That's what I did. 
If you feel in doubtful about your abilities, don't do that one. "
,brownkity,2011-01-04T04:02Z,"the other, less invasive way to stop the music, if it gets annoying is to press the mute button @ startup. That's just a temporary fix, as you're just muting your sound.


A more permanent fix it to right click on your desktop, 
personalize, 
sounds, and 
uncheck play windows startup sound. 

That's it. That's all I have. 
This one worked for me, so I decided to give my input, and upload this with a high upload allocation. I have been uploading it for a while. I have already passed a 3:1 ratio with that file, but it's such a good one that I'll keep it at that high allocation until I have 2 remove it from my laptop (I'm not sure how to change the file location from uTorrents after I move it in my computer, so that's why I sometimes have an error when uploading files after moving them to an external hard drive. That's my deed of the day. I just finished installing this on a friend's laptop who killed his, & it rox. I'm not a tech queen, but hey, this site allows me to appear to be 1. Thanks TPB, and all of you uploaders and modders. You make things easier for many who kill their systems with viruses. (That's what happened to his, and it couldn't even boot) Thanks AMJ for providing this and modding this version of windows 7, and thanks froggie for putting this on tpb. I only really use this site anyway."
,brownkity,2011-01-04T04:08Z,"Wow, slow me. You could just right click, and in that dropdown box, it has change sound. You don't have to go to personalize & do that extra step. But I'm new to win 7 (this is my first win 7 computer), so cut me some slack. lolz 0:)"
,brownkity,2011-01-04T04:20Z,"I know I'm writing a lot, but to the 1  who hated win 7 osx, I didn't change it, but try opening the folder marked extras (Netbook)
