Joining Jools on the sixth show of the series will be: Duffy, as the Welsh songstress
returning with her second album Endlessly, the follow-up to her multi-million selling
debut album in a career launched on 'Later' some three years ago; Sheffield's finest
Heaven 17, back in the saddle again for their 30th anniversary UK tour celebrating
their groundbreaking album, Penthouse And Pavement, with its synth-popfunk take
on the first years of Thatcherism and hits like Temptation; New Jersey rock and
rollers The Gaslight Anthem with songs from their second album, American Slang,
updating the blue collar rock that makes Bruce Springsteen a firm fan.

Jazz legend Herbie Hancock chats about his latest multi-artist album, The Imagine
Project, plus there's chat with Peter Asher, former pop star, A&R supremo and
producer, about the early days of Apple.
