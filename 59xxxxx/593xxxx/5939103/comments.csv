,p2p5p1,2010-12-02T14:05Z,I can't seem to locate Soft Body tags ?
,HaoSs07,2010-12-08T14:00Z,"Soft body's are there, just make sore you used the correct key (the studio one ) so you have c4d studio installed. if you use a brodcast ley for example, you will end up whit c4d brodcast, and no soft body there"

,rafson,2010-12-24T19:16Z,"In this version C4D Studio there is not a MOCCA plugin. I was used the correct key (studio).
Whats wrong is with that program?"
,torentas31,2010-12-24T20:33Z,"This is NOT Studio version-this Broadcast.I put it all keys and at the end i have Broadcast version,also update included in my inst. proces.In content browser there is no Visualize texture and rest what should be:(so sad....thanks anyway."

,godsmack41,2010-12-28T18:54Z,"OK.Everything OK.I should first read the comments than ask something.Thank you ""d3w10n"" for you answers even if you didn't answer ""my question ""."
,1ant5,2011-01-02T15:35Z,"I downloaded this torrent a while ago and it's worked perfectly, the only thing that i can't find inside the programme is the 'advance render' part of it even though it says it is there in the plugin files?"
,HaoSs07,2011-01-06T16:48Z,"C4D 12 is different form the 11 one, a lot of things have been moved,renamed,changed. Mocca plugin is not supported for now and you don't have rigid body, is now called Soft Body,
You don't need all the keys, only the STUDIO one, and you are set to go, if you end up whit the broadcast version , you did something wrong."
,dahaka131,2011-01-22T16:14Z,"Hey, I have a problem.. During the install.. it said
There was a problem downloading the update. Please try again later. Like wtf? What to do guys? "

,misteranimal,2011-04-10T13:14Z,"Am I missing something or am i the only one that's encountering this irritating error. I can only edit projects to a certain extent before the program freezes, for example when I'm busy editing texts (or whatever other edits) it suddenly stops even though the numbers on the side reflect that the text is moving, it doesn't. When it gets to this states, I can't even change views, I can't do nothing...my computer will run normally and everything else, but Cinema 4d won't run normally.  "
,misteranimal,2011-04-10T18:09Z,"Am I missing something, the program doesn't freeze as such but doesn't follow any of my commands whether they be to change the font, view or whatever command I give it. This always happens after a couple of edits (eight at most), I don't understand this and it's frustrating as I have to restart the program to carry on from where it froze, then I do the same thing over and over again until I finish my edits. It's extremely off-putting to have to do this. Can someone help me, do you know what the problem could be. Great upload HaoSs07 by the way....THANK YOU."

,djroosta,2011-05-04T13:16Z,@magiccskies - You would need to burn it to a DVD. CD Disks can only take 700-800 MBS whereas DVDS can take 4.7Gig

obvious way to obvious dumb fuck, btw i got rid of them.

nice try sad little cunt."
,djroosta,2011-05-13T01:44Z,"@ trashviruskid

Have you ever used End It All?

It is an application that ends tasks that you do not want, I do it every time before i play a game, and have not experienced spikes in any game at all)

Have you also considered checking your CPU Usage, Becuase i figure you know fuck all about computers.

There IS NO Virus on this, as i've scanned it several times (When i downloaded it) with several of my programs and not one has giving a virus ( I Use Eset, Malware Bytes & Spy Bot Search & Destroy) those 3 programs are very trusted and can alert you of a virus before you start a download.

I'm, Curious though, What TYPE of virus is it?
 because i haven't come across any since using it (And scanned after installing) and went deep into the ISO and all the files remain the same as any other ISO i have came across for C4D.

Obvious Fail to Trash a fellow uploader is Fail.

IT IS CLEAN!!!!!!!!"

,BlowBye,2011-07-12T20:05Z,"Amazing. Thanks, works like a charm with updates and all.

I needed a good tool for 3D file conversions and this looks very solid and is the best I've seen yet.

Make sure your PC is up to the system requirements, neither v12 nor 11.x of C4D works on a PC running an Intel Pentium Dual E2160 processor and Nvidia GeForce 6600 but no problems with Pentium Dual-Core E5300 and an ATI Radeon HD3850."

I have a separate user to my admin user and downloads go into 'downloads' on my user account, but its still my c drive. Is it best to download onto a separate drive? And then there are problems with keyjens (which this iso thankfully doesnt have) requiring admin rights etc.. just wanted to know whats the best way?

Thanks in advance."
