[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-06T00:08Z,works fine over G.
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-06T00:43Z,"hmm, i could be a liar.   seems to work fine for about 30 minutes then slows down.  maybe the wifi chip makes it too hot.  not sure whats going on here.  may have to revist the profile.  never experienced any problem over the wire though.  very strange."
,johnnyapplec,2010-11-06T11:10Z,There is a very minor glitch bug that happens after the buffer fills.  If you are looking for it you will see then it will drive you nuts.  All over the apple boards lets hope for a fix with the next update...
,Critic_101,2010-11-06T11:31Z,Hey HR have you already upped the Expendables and I missed it or is it work in progress!? Thanx 
,CodeZero23,2010-11-07T07:47Z,Hey HR glad to see you back...Can I ask you to do Sex and the city 2 and expendables for ATV
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-07T20:21Z,when avail.  working on eat pray love.
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-07T20:46Z,subtitles need major editing :/
,johnnyapplec,2010-11-08T13:08Z,"Holyroses,

How much quality loss would you get from starting with a 720p source instead of the 1080p ?  Using the -t appletv -pbM switch...  The 1080p's are harder to find and take forever to get... Thanks for your help as always!"
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-09T01:18Z,Not much.  Sometimes the 720p source is not very good to begin with.  If it looks ok to you then run with it.  1080p is easy for me to obtain.
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-09T02:44Z,"playing around with wifi G streaming on atv 1.  I doubt I can ever make it play perfectly like this.  I did make a change refs 5 to refs 3, seems alright so far.  Refs2 didn't play any better.  Probably something with B frames it doesn't like either.  It always play 100% perfect if synced.  ATV2 seems ok at this refs3, nothing else change.  but only way to test this is to play the dumb movie from start to finish.

testing is very long..."
,johnnyapplec,2010-11-09T03:13Z,So still best to use -t appletv -pbM ??  what do you mean refs2 refs3 refs5 ??
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-09T03:38Z,thats the encode setting for appletv that I recommend yes.  Some users complain of streaming issues with appletv.  Playing around with the finer settings of x264 encoder options to see if i can make it better for streaming.  The atv1 doesn't seem to have a buffer like atv2.
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-09T05:03Z,"my recommendation is dont use wifi, use a darn cable :)"
,icsaruba,2010-12-01T00:37Z,"Hello HR, thanks for the great uploads, I have one question, where can I get Spanish Srt for your releases?"
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-08T23:55Z,use google language tools and translate the file for free.
,NJinvincible,2011-08-13T05:49Z,"Thanks dude.
