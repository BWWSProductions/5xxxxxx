Guns N' Roses - You Could Be Mine [uncut promo].VOB



Very HQ rare complete uncut promo music video. "You Could Be Mine" is a song by American hard rock band Guns N' Roses, featured on their 1991 fourth studio album Use Your Illusion II. It was released as the band's seventh single, and the first from the Use Your Illusion albums, in June 1991. Backed with "Civil War" from Use Your Illusion II, the single reached number twenty-nine on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number three on the UK Singles Chart. 

Schwarzenegger appears in the music-video as the T-800 Terminator from the film who arrives at a Guns N' Roses concert, having mission orders to assassinate Axl. When the song is finished, the Terminator confronts the band and individually assesses each member. He gets to Axl and assesses that killing him would be "a waste of ammo." He then stares at Axl Rose for a while and walks off. Izzy Stradlin was conspicuously absent from the end section of the video. Edited by Jeffrey Abelson, it was one of the most requested music videos during that period, and contributed to the hype surrounding Terminator 2. At the end of 1991, MTV placed it at #1 on their top 100 videos for that year.
