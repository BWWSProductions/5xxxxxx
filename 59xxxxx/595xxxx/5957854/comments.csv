,umanzor,2011-12-04T08:01Z,"Just in case someone comes from the land of Google into this old rarity of a PC game:

You NEED a DVD-ROM emulator that can SecuROM such as Daemon Tools Lite or Alcohol 120%, otherwise the game won't start.

Apparently, this PC version of the game was only released in Australia or something, and this is why THERE ARE NO NO-CD PATCHES for it. Sucks.

Anyway, enjoy!"
