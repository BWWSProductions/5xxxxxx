,NitrogenUA,2010-11-16T21:54Z,"I thought connection speeds today are more then enough to just download and test it for yourself :) But yes, it does :)

herorocks, i belive PES 11 is already available here on TPB. On the other hand i have not found any PES-release to work on my console, so i have pretty much nothing to release. Hope you will have better luck. Cheers."
