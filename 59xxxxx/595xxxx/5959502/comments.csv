,keekie,2010-12-21T04:03Z,Why is this movie 7.09 GiB??
,561Hero,2010-12-21T06:53Z,Why do you do both dts and ac3 audio?
,Metroidn1f,2010-12-22T04:08Z,"you need to start considering quality over time instead of time over quality.  Use more reference frames, use a higher subme, use level 4.1, it would make your videos look a lot better.  It might take longer but the overall quality will greatly improve."
