[V],HMVinyl,2010-11-13T08:22Z,this was like #1 on my list of records I want to rip... thanks dude!
[V],HMVinyl,2010-11-13T16:47Z,oh wait never mind... I was thinking about Mothership... but this will do for now ;)
,Angri1,2010-11-13T18:39Z,"Insinuendo - - - another classic from you

Thanks old bean"
[T],insinuendo,2010-11-13T19:13Z,"Old bean!?...I'll take it as a compliment :)

I've got a couple of versions of DSOTM, so I'll add it to my collection to compare.

I still think Dr. Robert's MFSL 
Half-Speed Mastered version is pretty sweet, even though his Technics SL-1200MK2 still retails at like 600 USD."
[T],rjordan21,2010-11-14T06:32Z,"I'm very familiar with Dr. Robert's rips......but....seriously?  When was the last time you listened to a $25,000 turntable....

If you're really going to compare it to anything I'd be interested to hear what you think."
[T],insinuendo,2010-11-14T20:53Z,"It does sound rather lush, I'll admit. 

Only listened to it once though and noticed a few considerable pops.

I'll be uploading a 3 version package of DSOTM later with a UK Remaster 30 Harvest SHVL 804 version that was ripped with the vpi tnt-v ""hot-rod"" which is also rather decadent."
[T],rjordan21,2010-11-15T03:30Z,"Ha..... ""pops"" are part of the game....the music, however, shines through. If you've ever sat behind a drumkit and hit a cymbal...heard how that sound reverberates through the room. The music is the important part, right? If not, listen to the ""perfect"" 0's and 1's.  No pops there!
I'll be looking for your 3-version package.... "
[T],insinuendo,2010-11-15T11:17Z,"Yes...snap, crakles and pops ARE part of the game, not of the music however, so the less there are, the better. HQ vinyl and a good cleaning usually take care of that. Post-processing isn't all that necessary after that.

And yes, I'm a drummer. So I have sat behind a drum set...more than once, LOL. "
,perekdick,2010-11-16T15:03Z,"Thank U, insinuendo !
Lifetime stuff !!!"
,_kewlCat,2011-12-01T17:38Z,"Man, tks insinuendo. I bought the LP 2x (they went through too many groove scratching 70 & 80's parties). The r1aa redbook CD version sucks. But, this LP ver is as I remember it; beautiful, lush, hot. Jimmy would approve."
,SergioFCPorto,2012-03-23T04:49Z,thanks
