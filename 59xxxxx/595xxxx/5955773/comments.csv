,Ruski01,2011-01-25T07:13Z,To be honest with you I have been in every store possible to buy this game.. I found it online...but I really cant justify paying 5.95 shipping for a game that now sells for .50 Cents...just cant do it.
,Ruski01,2011-01-25T07:28Z,"Call me a noob, or someone that depends on ISO's way too much.. but how do I make this work? There is no installation instructions except for the ones that you would use to install the actual retail copy? Help please..."
