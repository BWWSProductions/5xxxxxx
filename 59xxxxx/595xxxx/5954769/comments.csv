i thought u wouldnt do it!
really thanks!!!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-13T18:07Z,These two - 5 hour of movies. Hence the size... and making just one sequel alone seemed as waste of space.
,skillet92,2010-11-13T19:39Z,"i thought it would be in 480p!
but i know the size would have gone more than 2gb...which would be tough for u to seed!
and moreover i am happy wid the release...thanks alot really!"

Thanks for the encode(s)/upload.

Cheers
Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-13T20:50Z,"Not just that... on TPB oly one can find two dozens of 2 GB and bigger - but plenty people cannot afford that.

Needles to say - I am not the problem... I can seed as fast as you want - but you are over-stretched and your speed both in download and upload must be balanced with your wishes. I know you are doing best you can - but please, try to ""harmonize"" your wishes with reality.

[V],twentyforty,2010-11-13T20:52Z,@jon4fun: ^^ was for skillet92 of course.
,cindal,2010-11-14T05:42Z,"Hey 20/40, I don't know if you are taking any requests or not, if not just disregard this cause I know you are probably busy.....  but if you are, maybe I could add Mirrormask to your list? I totally understand if you can't though. 
Thanks for all the great Movies/TV!! You're kinda a great one-stop-shop for it all!"
,skillet92,2010-11-14T05:47Z,"lol!
sure will keep it in my mind!
i have actually decided to stop requesting for sometime now!"
