,billybob45,2010-11-16T04:34Z,"If u look at a torrent & it has no screenshots (for porn) or a link 2 boxcover/official info about it (for films or tvseries etc) 1st search thepiratebay often some1 else uploaded the same file & included screenshots 2nd google it or use imdb.com or wikipedia & then copy&paste links 2 the info you find 2 help everyone , it only takes a few seconds per file (once u found the info) ,the more people stop being selfish  the better off well all be, thepiratebay may not be around forever so help out right now please. Also keep seeding dont just hit and run , seed as fast as your isp lets u upload ,the faster your upload speed the faster your download speed is for recieving data thats how bittorent works !im not a hypocrite sometimes when i go 2 post info tpb says database error failed to write..i dont have time 2  go back 2 the files i couldnt help out on , A good place to get help is http://forum.suprbay.org/index.php report fake files or drm files there.
 ,ps if you look at porn remember to respect women theyre gods greatest creation. torrentday your not doing yourselves any good by releasing torrents you fail to seed why would we bother going to your site if we think you fail to seed so many of your releases ?
