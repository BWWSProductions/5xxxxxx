,DancingG8,2010-11-14T02:21Z,"Elmogunch - You are an idiot.  almost EVERYTHING on this site is copyrighted..that's why it's called ""thepiratebay"".  As far as it being ""low-grade""..that's your opinion (..and I get 100's of d/l's so it must not be so bad)..but how would you even know what's ""low-grade"" when you've never contributed anything using this or any other fake name that you've come up with.  And lastly the only thing that is ""endless"" is your pointless, unfunny, and annoying posts that you do for no other reason but to amuse yourself while your jerkoff in some dark basement somewhere.  
In other words....
F-U-C-K O-F-F loser!!!!"
