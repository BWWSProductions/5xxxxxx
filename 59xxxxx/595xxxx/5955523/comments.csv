most of the movies these days have extended cuts.
Salt,A team,Avatar,Robin Hood.
I have seen many extended cuts.
Best of all is ""The Abyss"" extended by James Cameron.
""Kingdom Of heaven"" by RS also great.
Worst i have seen is ""Dances with the wolves DC""   "

that is because there is encoding that is VERY hard to transfer from a blu-ray DVD to a digital video file.  And even then, you hard drive would have to be an SAS or USB3 drive to support it."
