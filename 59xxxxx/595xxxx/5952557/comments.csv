@cookiekittens (and other mac users) - it works just fine with bootcamp, but you'd have to first convert the ISO to DMG (using disk utility), then burn the DMG image. You could probably burn the ISO directly using some 3rd party apps but if you use Disk Utility to burn the image, it's safer to convert it first."

I got a prob, 
I have burned the .iso file to a dvd, put it into my computer then this pops up:
""This version isn't compatible with your version of windows. To upgrade, u need the correct installation disc. For more information check you computers's system information. To install a new version of windows, restart (boot) your computer using the installation disc and then chose custom (advanced).""

Common man its pretty stated clear there on your screen msg that ur current windows version is different from the one u r trying to install.. I think u aren't aware of versions in windows. Anyway, what u have in ur computer is 32bit and the one here is 64bit. These 2 are very much different and 64bit cant be installed on 32bit. U shud have ur hardware too, to be compatible with 64bit windows. But i think u dnt have a hardware of that kind so better try to search for 32bit version.

Note : to help u out further i wud recommend the following torrent from the same uploader here. he is one of the best to rely on here.

,jebego,2010-11-25T03:27Z,"Wow! Looks like a great download!
I see you keep uploading new versions of the OS every month or so, is this because the normal way of updating once the OS is installed doesn't work? 

Or is it for some other reason?

If this OS works well, and there's no issue with updating from MS, I'll fucking love you!

Copy everything you want to keep onto a USB memory and/or DVD discs as this is a clean installation and everything on the computer will dissapear.

1: Burn the .ISO file to a DVD

2: Start the computer and make sure that you have made it so it boots from CD/DVD drive 

3: Installation starts

4: Is a cd key required during installation? If yes where is it found?

5: Win 7 Ultimate 64bit is installed (If you have 64bit hardware)

Describe how you now make it like a fully working real copy. What program do I use and what do I do with it?

Once you have made it exactly like a genuine version is there ANYTHING more we need to think about or will it work like a purchased version?"
,DX-Con,2010-11-28T19:57Z,"@Sub-Tex:

  No you do not need a key or serial. AFTER you install ""Explore"" the DVD that you made and open the file marked Activation or whatever.
  As far as i know you don't have to do a clean install if you are on vista 64-bit. Any other OS and you will have to."

OK, here goes:

Original OS is Vista Home Premium, 64-bit, with Service Pack 2 installed.  This info is straight from the 'Control Panel - Systems & Maintenance - System' screen.

I insert a burned DVD of your .iso file, the installer starts, it goes through the ""Copying Temporary Files"" bit, and the first thing after the EULA is a choice of where to install Windows 7.  It DOES NOT ask me what type of installation I'd like to do.  It simply asks which hard drive to install it to, and if I choose the C: drive it brings up the ""The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows installation..."" warning and that the old installation will be moved to a Windows.old folder after the new installation is complete.

Nowhere does it ask whether I'd like to do an upgrade install."

,lbasche,2010-12-10T04:17Z,"So I've been working on mounting the iso image on a 4 gb flash drive I picked up recently with a bit of difficulty. I began by using the diskpart option, list disk, select disk 1, clean, create partition primary, select partition 1, active, format fs=fat32, assign, exit, then going back to command prompt and using xcopy e:\*.* /s/e/f h:\ where e and h were the appropriate drives for the flash, and the image mounted using deamon tools, all of which is an accurate method, but when its all finished and I go to boot from the flash drive I get the ""missing a required cd/dvd driver"" error. So i tried downloading another version of the torrent, which again did the same thing. So i went back through, and tried to use the usb creation tool that you've provided in the torrent, and on step 3, after I select ""usb device"" it goes to format, and fails before it loads anything at all. I tried using the tool both with information on the usb, as well as after I formatted it using the diskpart application. Any help would be much much appreciated. "

,lbasche,2010-12-10T06:38Z,"@ Dank310

in terms of downloading torrents, press the ""download this torrent"" button (not the big download button thats an ad, but the smaller one above or below it) then make sure you have a bitorent application such as bitorrent or utorrent, i use utorrent personally but their practically the same thing. open the file you just downloaded off of piratebay in whichever program you chose, then wait while it downloads. the more seeds a torrent has, the faster it will generally go. then for this particular download, follow the instructions found within the folder once its all finished. computer_user lays everything out pretty simple, and it should work just fine so long as you have a little bit of tech savvy and your computer doesn't wanna give you the big middle finger in the middle of everything. x]"

'm having a little bit of trouble but im not quite sure if its related to the torrent or my computer. I've burned just the .ISO to a dvd and i try to run it at startup and it just gives me a blank screen with a flashing _ . i then checked to see if the data was written by testing it while i was logged in and it said i cant upgrade from this system (true im using XP) but do you have any idea why it isnt working? 

when I pressed boot from CD/DVD drive it just booted my xp like normal which I have currently installed.  So I went into bios disabled Harddisk boot and only left the CD/DVD, it just came up with some message saying to insert a bootable disc ect.  So just to clarify and make sure i have burnt only the ISO, I burnt the file named ""Windows 7 Ultimate (64 bit) which was within the folder named the same along with another folder named ""windows 7 Activation (Reccomended) I figured this was the ISO as it was the only file that was associated with my ISO mounting/burners. Is this correct? If so Do you think burning it at a slower speed would help? I used the power ISO program you included in the torrent. Sorry for the really long comment, cheers Jim."

I was still not prompted to enter any key, So my question is this correct and you dont need to enter it, or has it not worked properly and still needs activation? Also I did the important windows update after this ( apart from KB971033) but there was only 2 which doesnt seem a lot is this correct? and finally the last part of the instructions I dont not understand where it says Quote : 

You Can Also Burn The Activation Crack That Becomes Your Favorite Onto A Separate Cd For Faster Windows Activation. :)

This seems to imply that the activation will need to be installed regually, do u need to do it everytime you install a windows update, or is it only needed to be used once per install? 

Sorry again for the massive comment and thanks again for your time. Jim."

Yes You Can Use Windows Update :) Just Don't Download The KB971033 Windows Update. :P

""das_right123""

:) You Can't Do A Upgrade Type Installation By Restarting The Computer :P

You Need To Place The DVD Inside The DVD Driver, Open ""My Computer"" And Right Click On The DVD And Click On ""Open""

That's The Only Way Too Do A Upgrade Type Installation, Doesn't Matter Who's Torrent You're Wanting Too Use. :)

Although when I go properties on ""My Computer"" it says "" Windows is Activated and under that says Product ID: then a long serial.  So sounds like it all worked, is this correct?"

other one i formatted and i seperated him in 2 pieces. 400gb and 500gb. i installed my windows on the 500 gb one. But i can't see the other ones. the 400gb and my the one with my files 1tb. Please help me out i would really appriciate that.

I just redid a Toshiba laptop  (L305-S5875) which came with vista home premium.  The Toshiba web site in their support section had software and drivers for Win 7 â€“ they may have them for your particular model.  Included was the special software for the camera and special laptop function keys.  So, if you are interested in using Win 7 check Toshibaâ€™s support web site for your particular model to see if they have Win 7 drivers and software.

You've been giving these people great support, and this torrent looks great. However, I want to make sure everything goes smoothly. I'm currently running Windows 7 Home Premium, so I'll be using your really simple ""upgrade from desktop"" feature. 

But in case something goes wrong, I want to have Home Premium still around as a backup. Do you recommend any way to do that? Or can I just make a restore point and revert back to that if something goes wrong?

To anyone stuck at Expanding Files Portion of the install, here is some options for you:

 * DISABLE HYPERTHREADING in BIOS
 * DISABLE INTEL SPEEDSTEP in BIOS
 * DISABLE LEGACY FLOPPY DRIVE SUPPORT in BIOS
 * DISABLE FLOPPY COMPLETELY in BIOS
 * DISABLE ALL OPTIONAL BIOS SETTINGS
 * DISABLE IDE DEVICES
 * MOVE SATA PORT FROM 0TO1 or 1TO2
 * REMOVE ALL USB / NETWORK CABLES
 * EJECT DISC DURING INSTALL THEN CLICK CONTINUE
* PRESS 'X' DURING INSTALL THEN CLICK CONTINUE
* CHANGE DVD DRIVE
* BURN DVD ONTO DIFFERENT MODEL DISC
* BURN DVD AT SLOWER RATE

You are wrong because you might have never seen how the real original DVD behaves. This torrent is a shit, it does not mean that you cannot setup the OS, but  options have been deleted from the original.

For example,
1. You don't have the option to choose the system you want, 32 bit or 64 bit;
2. You can't upgrade, not use the upgrade for a total system repair option, you can only install erasing all your OS;
3. If your system fails you can't repair it with the Recovery on the DVD because there is no access.

These are the most important. This is not really a hoax, this is the uploader f*cking people. Of course, people are too ignorant to see it until they get in trouble. Most people don't even know what they have in their computers, like silly spetra just above."

,wkmg2,2011-02-17T23:47Z,"MAC OSX FAQ THIS DOES WORK

First of all thanks for the great upload, Computer-User.

Ok guys, I'm a novice and managed to get this working on a Mac using boot camp so you can do it too. You can set up your Mac to boot both OSX and Windows 7. Here is what I did.

Download the torrent then burn the iso onto a DVD using disk utility. You can find out how to do this here,

http://lifehacker.com/#!251758/mac-tip--how-to-burn-an-iso-or-dmg-file-to-disc

Now make sure your version of Snow Leopard is fully updated then open bootcamp. This can be found in utilities. Then print off the bootcamp instructions and follow them as if you were installing a legit version of windows. You may or may not have some trouble making the partition. If you do, this is how to fix it. Back up your mac HDD using time machine then format your HDD by booting from the Snow Leopard install disk. When your Mac is formatted reinstate your time machine back up and your mac will appear the same as it did before. 

Now follow boot camp as per the instructions. Once Windows 7 is installed, boot up windows and install boot camp off your original OSX install disk. This will enable the touch pad, air port and everything else to work in Windows. You may have trouble ejecting the Windows install disk at first, if you do shut down your mac and restart it whilst holding the eject key. To make your mac boot in windows, when you turn it on hold down the option key (alt) and you'll be given the choice.

Now, once windows is running you have all the drivers working run the activation program which came with the torrent. 

I hope this helps. As I said, I am a complete novice so I'm sorry if this isn't as clear as it should be. However, I managed to get it working with no prior knowledge so you guys should be able to as well. Once again, thanks, Computer-User for a great upload."

Have you went into the bios setup screen at startup and changed the boot order so that it reads your DVD drive first?

For some reason even after the startup the red light on my machine keeps glowing which implies that my machine is busy and at this moment I can do nothing. Interestingly the task manager also do not show. If I do a Ctrl+Alt+Del, there's no response from the machine. Its like doing some work after the start up but u cant trace what it is."

One thing..I don't get the option of upgrade or custom install, I don't know why. So to make a clean install, I format my C drive and then install it. Do you foresee a probable reason for this thing not working in the behavior I just described. But why shouldn't I get the screen for the 'type of installation'?"

Uhm, this is my first computer that supports a 64-bit OS, and i'm currently running it on 32-bit OS.
So now I'm wondering if i can just DL this 64-bit and upgrade my 32-bit to this 64-bit?

Will any data loss occur if i can just upgrade?

Current system is:
Intel Core 2 Duo CPU E4700@2.6GHz,
ASUS P5QC Motherboard,
2x 2GB DDR3 10600MHz,
NVIDIA Geforce 9500GT DDR2 512MB/2,

Samsung 23"" Full HD,
Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit Service pack 1.

Any feedback would be highly appreciated."
,ouldscratch,2011-05-12T13:56Z,@rastas959 you cannot upgrade a 32bit system to 64bit system as a regular upgrade. If you really want to do it then backup your files. You could always partition your drive and move the files on to the second partition and install windows on the first partition!

,farphignougen,2011-12-10T11:45Z,"Would it screw things up if I extracted the .iso file to its own folder, moved the extra stuff into that folder, and burned all of that onto a DVD so the Windows installation and all the activation tools were in the same place?"
,Friendlywolf,2011-12-17T12:57Z,Been using it for a few days. Works flawlessly.
,kieki,2011-12-20T03:26Z,Does this work upgrading from Vista to 7 while keeping my files?
,hiayushman,2011-12-26T16:56Z,"Brilliant torrent!
All the necessary tools in just one link!

Thanks for the work!!!"
,Sanity_included,2012-01-15T14:20Z,"This torrent works perfectly!
A few little tips in case you don't know what to do next.

1. Once downloaded install one of the ISO programs (I used powerISO) so you can burn the W7 ISO to disc

2. Once installed, do not activate one of the keys  manually, i.e going through computer\properties.  I recommend using the Windows 7 Activation tool.

3. Last but not least do not install the windows update KB971033.  As if you do it will say your W7 isn't genuine.  Go to Control Panel\System and Security/Windows Update, then to the update menu.  And deselect the update.  Better still right click it and select hide update so you won't install it by accident."
,dumbleton,2012-01-27T04:14Z,"I downloaded and burnt ISO to disk. and used USB boot program in this torrent, to put on USB all went well then at the end of installation when finalising I keep getting blue screens, then an error, unexpected restart or shutdown, to continue installation restart the computer and start installation again does someone know what to do to get around this?

,MiG_Flanker,2012-02-25T10:56Z,"Hi, I'm just about to burn a DVD for a clean install on a brand new laptop. I've read tons of these comments and learned a lot. So I have one last question, before I start: for a clean install I have to burn the ISO file to the DVD and that's all, right? I mean I don't burn the files themselves, but the single ISO, right?

Thx in advance."
,MiG_Flanker,2012-02-25T11:02Z,"Ok, got my answer by myself:) Will burn now and install tomorrow, I'll be back to report on how it all went:D

Cheers"
,MiG_Flanker,2012-02-25T11:15Z,Minimum burning speed with PowerISO is 2.4x hope it's slow enough.
,atulkmr,2012-03-13T04:15Z,Is this version bootable ? and are there no bugs ? I mean i downloaded one such release by MAFIAA.. but it had some probs. like as soon as i connected my PC to a TV (HDMI) it started dump of physical memory

,syst3m68,2012-04-13T05:27Z,Windows update seems VERY persistent... 
,Jimbob145,2012-04-16T11:28Z,"I have had this windows on for a year or so now and it has been o.k but recently I did a boot virus scan on avast and it found a file in windows/setup/scripts/ called faXcooL.exe  it lists it as Win32:WPAkill[pup].  I put it in the virus chest and did a search about this file, The best answer I found was this: 

 ""faXcooL.exe is a Hack tool used for disabling Windows Genuine Advantage Checks, it is what they call a ""Remove WAT"" tool,""

So I was wondering is this something I need to leave to keep my cracked windows working properly and has just been picked up as a virus when it isn't one?  Or should I just delete it?  Anyone found this, or know what its for?"

,asdf672001,2012-04-27T18:13Z,"Just to state that i upgraded from your 32 bit version to the 64 bit and as usual,thanks to the quality of your torrent it was a flawless install. 
The added tools are so useful and even includes a tool for converting to flash drives. A tremendous and generous package for which I am very grateful.
You have got a front row seat in Pirate Bay Heaven, thanks Computer-User."
,Paracel,2012-05-06T21:34Z,"Oh crap, during downloading this torrent AVG found malware...Crack.CO.dropper and apparently its trojan. 
Yesterday I downloaded Windows 7 Ultimate from Team ! M-J-R and when I wanted to extract their windows 7 loader AVG found same damn trojan Cracker.CO.Dropper.
Computer-User, do you have any explanation about that?"
,Onimaru78,2012-05-20T17:02Z,is this 7600 or 7601??
,asdf672001,2012-05-29T07:14Z,Reading through some comments some people need to do some basic homework. Computer-User has given you all the tools to help you - Maybe computer-user should take a plane to your home and burn the disc for you.
