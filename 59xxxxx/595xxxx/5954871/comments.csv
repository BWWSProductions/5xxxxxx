,i2true4who,2010-11-16T14:43Z,"KNOWN BUGS:

Bugged Out Saves-
 Just go back to main menu after clicking on the campaign and click campaign again,you should be able to resume...

Random Freezes and Stutters- 
Needs fine tuneing just go to task manager with black ops ""open and running"" find black ops on processes and right click go to priority and set to high, then resume game, should help performance.
plus just close as many other windows and programs as possible before you play the game...

Game Breaking Bug Right Before Taking the Helicopter:
 I don't know if this is happening to other people but right before I take the Hind (helicopter) the game shits out and I start no-clipping all over the place...wtf?

Steam Opening and Game Not Opening: 
Pretty simple fix...completely close and exit steam before starting game!

No Multiplayer:
Come on guys anyone who pirates these video games knows multiplayer never comes cracked for you, just deal with it. (some games actually do have multiplayer enabled and ready for use, but are few and far between)

I think everything has been covered so far....."
,i2true4who,2010-11-16T14:47Z,"Oh almost forgot a bug that I am having on campaign...its where if I hold ""forward too long"" the player will keep moving forward for a few more seconds and is impossible to move, while it doesn't last very long it does get me killed 10x more than usual...actually its not just ""forward"" its any button, lol"

,devin221,2010-11-17T03:42Z,what is the steam_appid in the skidrow file mean? what are we suppose to do with those numbers?
,Shady2929,2010-11-17T12:00Z,"for people with no multi-GPUS, disable that in config.cfg file and your game will be less laggy, it sure did for me 

open the config.cfg file located in the ""Player"" folder with notepad, press "" ctrl+f "" and type MULTI, then press find

look for seta r_multiGpu ""1"" and disable it by changing the value of ""1"" to ""0""only if you have a SINGLE GPU

also change the values of seta rmultithreadeddevice to ""1"",, seta clmaxpackets to ""100"" and seta commaxfps to ""120"", this fixes the lag a bit as well, it's ok to change them them whether you have single or multi GPUS

and this is a tweak I found for enabling the ingame console ""for those who suffer from the current FOV (field of view)"" change the value of seta monkeytoy to ""0"", this will enable the ingame console, press the ~ button ingame and type /cgfovdefault 80

I really hope this helps someone :)

So i uninstalled and reinstalled into the DEFAULT DIRECTORY that comes during setup then copied the Skidrow crack mentioned earlier. That did the trick.. pc config, core 2 duo 1.8Ghz,2 Gb RAm, Nvidia 7300 Gt card, WIndows XP +Sp3. So not even a gaming rig. I play at 1024x768. Laggy but managed to complete the first mission without any problems.(crash , black screen, etc)
For some reason I think its tied into the DEFAULT DIRECTORY that pops up during setup.. Hopefully the updates would solve the lag..BTW a folder PLAYERS is created in the once any mission is completed.. A backup of that before running the update may help "
