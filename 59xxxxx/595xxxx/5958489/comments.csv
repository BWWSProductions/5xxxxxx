the key reg is not good (my previous winrar still made it have fully activated ) well when clicking on the reg file this is what comes up :

Cannot import rarreg.key: the specified file is not a registry script .
you can only import binary registry files from within the registry editor .
WHAT did you messed up there mate ?
