All three Raving Rabbids party games in one disc! This is a dual-layer disc. I ripped it with a WODE (Wii Optical Drive Emulator) so the image is as clean as it can be. Scrubbed with Wii Scrubber, though it didn't do much. Then placed in 12 Rar files, which also didn't do much. Still, the game plays great, and no release team has gotten to this one yet!

Description from Gamefly:
The Rabbids invasion began innocently enough. Since their debut, the crazy rabbit-like creatures have run amok across all kinds of consoles and situations. This Rabbids Party Collection for Wii brings together the first three games to feature the rabbids and their off-the-wall brand of mini-games. Play full versions of three Rabbids favorites: Rabbids TV Party, Rayman Raving Rabbids 2, and the extravaganza that started it all, Rayman: Raving Rabbids. Combined, the three titles feature 175 mini-games. Take over TV, take over the Earth, and more in challenges that riff on pop culture and are overrun with insane rabbid antics.
