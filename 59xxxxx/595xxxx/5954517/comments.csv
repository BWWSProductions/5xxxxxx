If the seed disappears, just be patient and I'll be back! Once a few people end up getting this, I ask that you seed for a while until a few more people get it, and then let the chain continue so I can free up my wife's laptop. Thanks for your patience and cooperation, and enjoy the game!"
,zero44928,2010-11-20T21:48Z,tell your wife she has lost her computer privileges until someone else gets to 100%
,RandyLude92,2010-11-21T18:07Z,"OMFG!

If you can't fucking seed something then don't upload it.
here's an idea for you:
why not just limit the amount of connected peers or available bandwidth for upload so your phone doesn't completely crap out and you can actually finish what you started?!?!?!

or why not just set it to seed when you go to bed and neither of you are using the damn computer????

bottom line is, you're a fucking moron and there are litterally over a hundred people stuck waiting at 69% because of you.
I don't give a fuck if you just seed to one damn upload slot at least SOMEONE will get the full copy eventually and maybe they wont be such a douche and they'll seed properly."

,MarcusRaven86,2010-11-23T15:03Z,"Look, I'm doing the best I can. If you don't want it, go away.

I completely forgot that I made these password protected. I was intending on uploading them somewhere else first, but that didn't work out.

Password is: tehparadox.com

I'm doing my best. This is real, because I ripped it myself. All large torrents have to start somewhere, so quit complaining and have patience. Why are you downloading torrents if you're not patient anyway? Seems counter-intuitive."
,MarcusRaven86,2010-11-30T15:15Z,"So, does anybody else feel like commenting on the quality of the Torrent? Some other people saying its good would be nice, as I'm pretty sure one opinion from the uploader isn't enough for most people.

Remember, password is: tehparadox.com"
,scooty1us,2010-12-02T02:30Z,Wow!!! Why can't someone say thanks instead of bitching the guy out. Thanks Marcus..
,zero44928,2010-12-09T03:32Z,"Got it, seeding, thanks!  your wife can go back to her business."
,xp123321,2010-12-14T02:20Z,"Great upload Marcus, but I'm having a lil trouble running it, crashes back to main screen after the selection screen, any idea why that might be?

Can you tell us what you use to launch it?

thx"
,zero44928,2010-12-17T15:46Z,Having the same problem.  Goes back to main screen after selecting which game.  Gonna have to look for the games individually.
,s1a,2011-01-03T19:06Z,"Same here, I use USB Loader GX and I can't load it. I tried with different versions of IOS and it still doesn't work. As soon as I click on one of the 3 games, it puts me back to the WII menu."
,MarcusRaven86,2011-01-06T16:28Z,"The reason it kicks back out to the menu is most likely do to IOS reloading. Sam and Max episodes do the same thing. I don't know personally if it works with this, but try looking into an ALT DOL method for it. I personally use a WODE, so its like loading the actual disc. (WODE emulates the actual DVD drive, not software, so there's no loading issue.) Looking for an ALT DOL method should help though. Customizable USB Loader has an option for this, but I'm not sure what else you might need."
,jrtf83,2011-03-01T09:50Z,"This is the first Wii game I've had trouble running. Tried running the other .dol's, tried disallowing Ios reloads.  This is with Wiiflow."
,PhilanthropyAndAnarchy,2011-05-06T22:53Z,"To anyone having problems loading using USB Loader GX. Go to game settings and select Alternate Dol then select a dol from a game. Then there will be 4 options in SELECT DOL OFFSET, rr1, rr2, rr3 and don't use the last. Each rr corresponds to the game you want to play. Should be good to go."
,LymphN0de,2011-12-22T09:54Z,Come on guys please seed. I only need 860mb to be done. But the closer I get to 100 the lesser seeders there are. But at lease there is one seeder seeding at around 30kb. There is another 100 but hes not giving a single kb.
,LymphN0de,2011-12-22T20:58Z,Ok I finally got it. I will be seeding ;). Extracting it now but when I play it I'll give ya a good comment lol.
