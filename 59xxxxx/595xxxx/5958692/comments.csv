,ziggazig,2010-11-21T15:50Z,"@justinwu86 I totally have the same problem (running WIN7 64bit). It patched DTS okay, but when the muxing began, the program errored saying 'Muxing Failed'. 

This is insanely disappointing. Such a waste of a HUGE download that took freaking forever. I appreciate the effort in the upload though - I'm just sad I can't watch through PS3 on my system..."

,ziggazig,2010-11-21T23:43Z,"@Han3 Thanks for the link! I tried the PS3 Media Server with the new MEncoder file and still no luck. I can play other mkv's, but when I try this one it says the data is corrupted. This MKV doesn't want to be transcoded in any way. I'll keep trying stuff, but I'm still sad. "
,ziggazig,2010-11-22T18:24Z,"PS3 PROBLEM: UPDATE Nov.22.2010 - After some further research, I was able to solve the problem. 

1. Download and install mkvtoolnix - http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/downloads.html

2. Open mkvtoolnix and add the mkv file. Click 'Extra Options' for each element of the file (video, audio, and subtitles) and change compression to 'None'. 

3. In the 'Global' tab, choose 'Enable Splitting', select 'after this file size', choose option '4483'. 

4. Click 'Start Muxing'

5. Add the newly created mkv file to mkv2vob and everything should 'Mux' properly for PS3 playback.

This worked for me, so I hope the same tactic will work for others. All the best!  (also, the quality is amazing)"
,Han3,2010-11-23T11:31Z,@ziggazig Thanks! 
,justinwu86,2010-11-24T08:45Z,"@ziggazig
hey thanks for the help.

1 question.  i notice it splits the movie into 2 files.
is it possible to make it as 1 file?"
,dwil168,2010-11-25T21:20Z,"Hiya ziggazig, I did as you said, and just as with justinwu i get two files after using mkvtoolnix.

However once i use mkv2vob i get fine video but sound is just horrible static."

There's 16 seeds and 44 leechers right now so where a movie this size would usually finish d/l for me in an hour or less, this one is taking approx. one day.  It's still free so you won't hear me complaining.  I'm also really looking forward to this blu-ray copy.  Thanks for bringing this to us and for all your hard work Aoloffline!!"

,1eyedfishstick,2010-11-29T07:56Z,"Yep, something seriously wrong with this mkv file. It completely freezes up my WDTV Live media player when I press play.

I have hundreds of mkv files and never had this problem. I have to unplug the player to get it to play ANY files after trying to play this one.

It seems to work fine on my Win 7 computer with VLC but since other people are having issues with various players, be wary. Download at your own risk."

,1eyedfishstick,2010-11-29T09:58Z,"OK after reading the other comments I figured there might be an issue with the DTS soundtrack. I downloaded the Popcorn MKV Audio Converter and converted the DTS track to AC3 5.1. You can select to delete the ""bad"" DTS track before remuxing.

 It took about 15 mins to do this on my i5 machine. Seems to work fine now on my WDTV Live box and the file size is almost 1GB smaller without the DTS track. Software link is below for anyone who needs it.

,XyHavix,2011-01-23T12:51Z,"Okay people, don't listen to these copyright fags, they do whatever they can (report false viruses, this email thingy) to not let you download this film. Just do it to counter-act these desperate pricks. You can take my word that you won't get an e-mail, because they simply are too dumb to track your IP via uTorrent, aren't allowed to, and can't do anything with the data anyway.
Just download and enjoy.

Also I'm downloading this, was supposed to watch this with parents but they didn't get the plot so it got turned off after half an hour. Yay for redownloading :P"

,kccodeone,2011-01-24T18:27Z,I hate to tell you but in the US they do send these letters.  That is why you need a IP blocker to keep you from connecting to them.   WB is most likely fishing on this torrent for the IP addresses.  
,kccodeone,2011-01-24T18:32Z,"I hate to tell you all, but here in the US they do send these copyright infringment letters.   That is why you need an IP blocker to keep you from connecting to the known companies.    I am sure WB is on this torrent just to gather IPs that are downloading.

,kght22,2011-02-28T10:52Z,"best solution, but devastating to torrents, to the email problem, is to remove the download from your queue the second the download is finished. in us law it only becomes illegal once you are uploading something you can actualy use. and they cant upload anything at all to catch you, if they upload at all, they are breaking the law. and its against the law for law enforcement to break the law to catch a law breaker. there are some exceptions to this rule but very few. generaly the exceptions involve turning a cop into an informant who isnt a cop."
