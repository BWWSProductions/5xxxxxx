,[s8n],2010-11-14T23:58Z,Does this have the Mandarin subs hardcoded as well as the english subtitles? I'm looking for one with just the english subs. Cheers for the up... cool movie.
,QborT,2010-11-15T02:07Z,Ya same question as [s8n] does this have only english hardcoded or is there also the simplified chinese hardcoded aswell?????
,QborT,2010-11-15T17:46Z,"I have been informed that this is dual subbed aswell.

Fuck all you fuckheads that couldn't take the 2 seconds to answer this question for [s8n] and myself.... Fuck all you useless fucks in this community."

,QborT,2010-11-17T18:55Z,"Hah SoftWarez that wasn't directed to you, I know that what you posted in the description is the NFO.  I also know that you are a mass uploader and obviously don't watch all these rips (hell I even know that they are most likely on a seedbox so not even available on your HD to check).

The comment was directed towards the downloaders.  Who are consitently here and reading the comments and could have easily answered the simple question.

BTW the subs are horrible, they always are with Mandarin releases.  Always wait for the Cantonese release with proper subs."
