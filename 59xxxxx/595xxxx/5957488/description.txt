Why bodybuilding? Put simply, lifting weights - or resistance training - is one of the best ways to achieve total body health and fitness. Research has shown time and again that pumping iron provides a host of benefits: Bigger muscles, of course, but also greater strength, higher bone density, and improved cardiovascular capacity. Adding muscle also naturally ignites your body's internal fat-burners, increasing your metabolism while lowering your blood pressure and cholesterol. Oh yeah, and you'll look terrific.

- Complete workouts and techniques to maximize results

- How bodybuilding is different and better than other training methods
