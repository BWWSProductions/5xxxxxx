In 1988, Christmas was cancellet for many people: Pan American Airways flight 103, a Boeing 747 carrying 259 people, was bombed on a London-New York flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all on board, plus 11 people on the ground. 

This almost unknown film goes back several years before the bombing, showing how Pan Am received numerous warnings without doing much to avoid them, except hiring phony security guards and dogs to make people feel falsely safe.

This is a gem for 'planespotters' and watchers of "Seconds from disaster". Lots of authentic footage of Pan Am's 747s and 737s. Also surprisingly detailed about how the terrorists cells worked and how well they were organised in many countries, among them Germany and Sweden. Western laws had not yet permitted the police to arrest people suspected of planning an act of terrorism, before any such act had been performed. The warnings even revealed that the bomb would be hidden in a radio cassette player. As a sinister coincidence, the brand would be the Toshiba "Bomb-Beat".

The bombing was said to be an act of revenge after the U.S. Navy shot down a civilian Airbus 'by accident' over the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 on board, in July 1984. This atrocity received much less attention in Western media.

Once the world's most prestigious airline, Pan Am was almost in free fall at this point in time. Its dynamic president, Juan Trippe, left the airline in 1968 without grooming an heir, to face a stagnation in air travel combined with fierce competition. Top management was frequently changed, and losses accumulated to over 1 billion dollars. The Lockerbie disaster was the last nail in the coffin before the airline ceased operations in 1991.

This interesting film has never been released on DVD, but I managed to obtain a very good transfer from the pristine VHS I bought from the U.S. in 2004, in a CLEAN 6-head VHS player.

Very good VHSrip 688x432, original fullscreen, good simulated stereo sound.

If you are not happy with the aspect ratio, adjust it to 4:3 in any other program than Windows Media Player. Good free player here:
