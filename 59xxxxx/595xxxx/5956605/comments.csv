,Merlin_Monroe,2010-11-14T20:01Z,This is the best VHS rip I have seen! As close to a DVDrip as one could get. How did you make it?
[V],Kuthumi,2010-11-14T20:34Z,"First, you have to use a clean VHS player, preferably an advanced 6-head, and know how to adjust the tracking for the stereo or hi-fi sound track if necessary. There are good cleaning cassettes on sale. I even open my players regularly and clean the drum and the heads with an electronic cleaning spray. Lots of dirt accumulates, especially if you have been playing old cassettes floating around without a dust-proof cover.

If you have more than one player, choose the one that gives the best tracking for the VHS tape to be ripped. Use earphones. What you see and what you hear is what you get.

A 6-head PAL VHS player often gives better rendering of a NTSC cassette because it is built for higher resolution and more detail than the older and inferior NTSC system. Most of the PAL players will automatically adjust to the NTSC system.

Then connect the VHS player to a DVD recorder and record with highest possible quality. Edit (cut at start, ads and end) if necessary and burn, still with the highest possible quality. Check the finished DVD, its quality should be identical to what you saw from the VHS player. Then rip this DVD as any other. Crop a little extra at the bottom, top or sides if there are some disturbances in the picture.

Note: This only works with older retail VHS cassettes or home recordings. The latest retail cassettes (1995 and later) often had copy protection which will mess up the recording circuits. Electronic gadgets to remove the copy protection are rather expensive."
