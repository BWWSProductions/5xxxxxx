This movie blows. bad acting, cheesy storyline, and an even cheesier premise. 

but it is for children who im sure will enjoy it. :P"
,missoss,2010-11-17T05:24Z,"The download is good, 10/10.

The movie?

Nick cage truly is the worst actor on earth.  How does he keep getting work?  I wouldn't show this to kids.  They don't deserve to be treated as so naive."

K-Lite Mega Codec Pack never let me down..."
,ransomboy,2010-12-03T17:44Z,"VLC is not garbage - it's the ONLY media player I've ever found that never fails to play anything (including ""broken"" files others can't even open). K-Lite mega codec pack is the one you need for it. 

Good call T3chn0m4nc3r"
,dypimentel,2010-12-03T20:02Z,good copy thanks
,spydrz,2010-12-05T03:32Z,peerblock rules......... i use k-light with media player classic....plays everything just fine 
,glande,2010-12-05T12:50Z,it is a bad movie i recommend it just for the very young ones.Nicolas Cage looks like he escaped from the wax museum 
,murrambingi,2010-12-06T13:29Z,"thx for the upload extremezone,
excellent quality

great movie, but i would say kids would get more of a kik out of it, but i enjoyed it :)"
,Exhaust,2010-12-07T15:14Z,"10 for sound??????

On WMP it stops after about 10 seconds and on VLC player it sound like dolby surround forced over 2 channels with an added delayed buffer playback (or weird electronic sounding annoying echo if you please)

So: V10; S3"
,csabaxb,2010-12-08T19:50Z,"Very good torrent, fast download (4 minute), A/V-10+. I use only KMplayer. For me , it's the best player and play everything. I try this movie with VMP too, and it's ok. The sound NOT stop at all. Very good. Who cannot play that movie, try Kmplayer with CCCodec pack, or K-lite Pack. Never use MEGA pack, big mistake!!!. Big thanx uploader and seeders."

,ZanpakutoUnleased,2011-01-26T19:05Z,"Perfect upload!!! But another tortured film due to the fact it was made by Disney. The main actor Jay Baruchel was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. Nicolas Cage's performance was in my opinion the worst of his career......(and that's saying a lot if you've ever been forced to sit through the movie Con Air). The quality of the upload was the only thing worth mentioning....Thanks extremezone.


@glande .....escaped from the wax museum???  WTF!??"
