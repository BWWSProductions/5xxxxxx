Young police officer Shane Cooper (Ryan Kwanten) relocates to the
small country town of Red Hill with his pregnant wife Alice to start a
family. But when news of a prison break sends the local law
enforcement officers - led by the townÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ruling presence, Old
Bill - into a panic, ShaneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first day on duty rapidly turns into a
nightmare.

Enter Jimmy Conway, a convicted murderer serving life behind bars,
who has returned to the isolated outpost seeking revenge. Now
caught in the middle of what will become a terrifying and bloody
confrontation, Shane will be forced to take the law into his own
hands if he is to survive.
