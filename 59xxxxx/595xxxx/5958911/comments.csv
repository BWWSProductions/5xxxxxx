,phryed,2010-11-16T04:27Z,"fake, its just a episode of ""The Big Bang Theory"".  I was excited though."
,ogudaktig,2010-11-16T04:30Z,"Actually, there is a 36 screener out. This may be a fake, but it's out there."
,cheater71,2010-11-16T04:49Z,"I promise everyone who has ever downloaded a video of mine, this is real. I don't know why some people would say its fake. Maybe they're trolls or producers of the movie."
,llanvabon,2010-11-16T04:56Z,Well... I dl'ed it and watched 36 minutes of Harry Potter. WB watermark and all. No codec issues. Thank you.
,whitey85,2010-11-16T05:08Z,real but only 36 minutes of beginning of film. very pointless
,DarthBubba,2010-11-16T06:00Z,"It's more than we had two hours ago.  Even though it's already different from the book in details, it's already better than the Half-Blood Prince.  So far, at least.

Thanks to the uploader, and whomever he got it from."
,jrdburrow,2010-11-16T06:54Z,"It is most definitely real.  IDK why they are saying it's fake, because it's not....
Now I just want to see the rest "
,fadedexile,2010-11-16T06:55Z,"100 % REAL, thx cheater71"
,DigitalCr0w,2010-11-16T08:01Z,"Real!

,Rbeato,2010-11-16T09:01Z,why only UL the first 36 minutes if you have the whole film? please upload the entire film. millions would be greatful.
,Rbeato,2010-11-16T09:04Z,"why does it only have to be the first 36 minutes? could you please UL the entire movie, and im sure millions would love you for it. :)"
,ahstpk,2010-11-16T09:12Z,"100% Real

,mikeydada,2010-11-16T10:43Z,n thnx cheater71 this is absolutely real ...and the print was good enough considering the movie hasnt even been released yet..
,mikeydada,2010-11-16T10:55Z,and 1 more thing ..even the uploader says there is a watermark....well i did not get any of that on my player...
,msmmpts,2010-11-16T13:31Z,I am downloading .will give feedback.
,hobbin001,2010-11-16T13:39Z,"You're a G! How anyone ever gets these.....


Aye aye, cap'n"
,5couse,2010-11-16T14:06Z,"It is the first 36 minutes and contains a large WB watermark in the back ground although it is not intrusive.

Video is not too bad but is pixelated in parts , audio is fine.

Just waiting on the rest now lol"
,mikeydada,2010-11-16T15:31Z,we can hope for a full print tomorrow as the movie releases tomorrow in some countries....i can't wait ....lol
,msmmpts,2010-11-16T17:55Z,Nice work cheater71..Video and audio is pretty good.I hope u upload the complete movie with the same quality.
,ahstpk,2010-11-16T18:46Z,"Well @distortedlife55 if 36 minutes has been leaked the whole movie will be in no time...just let it come in cinema....

1st 36 minutes are not upto expectation...it suffers lack of action and NO SUSPENSE...i repeat no suspense...Worst movie of all parts..!!
7 potter part seems to be the joke of all..It hasnt shown even half of what its in book....ACTION LESS , Suspense less Scene...

Rating 4/10"
,cheater71,2010-11-16T23:43Z,"For everyone who wants me to upload the rest...i don't have any more of it. Sorry but i only found 36 minutes out on a file sharing site, and uploaded it here since i was worried it might be taken down from the other site. If i ever get my hands on the whole movie, i'll upload it though."
,msmmpts,2010-11-17T02:40Z,But cheater71 i think u can upload the entire movie within a day or two rite?
,yopepoy,2010-11-17T15:17Z,"this is real, but it would be better to wait for the whole movie."
,phryed,2010-11-17T20:45Z,"Yes it is real, when it finished downloading I opened the wrong file in my dl folder, guess that means I gotta organize it.  Not fake, sorry to wound your image cheat"
,mikeydada,2010-11-19T15:05Z,guys...it is highly recommended to watch the movie in 3d in the cinemas....it is the best hp movie so far....u will love it
,cheater71,2010-11-20T05:11Z,"Well its not in 3D Mikeydada, so thats not possible"
