This Month's Guest: Neon Trees

Provo, UT band Neon Trees, this monthâ€™s featured performers on the 36th edition of the award-winning Live from Darylâ€™s House web show, have been one of the yearâ€™s breakout newcomers with the single, â€œAnimal,â€ from their Mecury/IDJ Records debut album, Habits, after being personally picked by label-mates The Killers to be an opening act on the groupâ€™s 2008 North American tour. Vocalist/ keyboardist Tyler Glenn and drummer Elaine Bradley joined Daryl for a six-song set that included â€œAdult Educationâ€ and â€œHead Above Water,â€ from the 1981 album, Private Eyes. Daryl and the band also performed four songs from its debut album, including the #1 Alternative hit, â€œAnimal,â€ as well as â€œ1983,â€ â€œLove and Affectionâ€ and â€œFarther Down.â€

Commented singer Glenn: "Iâ€™ve told all of my close friends and family that this was one of my most favorite creative musical days so far. It was a privilege to be in a room with great players, no frills and great songs. Not to mention the chance to jam with one of the seminal songwriters, Daryl Hall. I will always cherish my Live from Darylâ€™s House experience fondly!"
