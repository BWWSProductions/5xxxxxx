Amazon.com Review
Guest Reviewer: Seth MacFarlane
Seth MacFarlane is best known for creating the animated sitcoms Family Guy, American Dad! and The Cleveland Show.

Reading In Fifty Years Weâ€™ll All Be Chicks opened my eyes to three things: 1) Adam is a top-notch complainer, probably the best in the world, 2) America is in serious trouble, and 3) Adam is hilarious.

Adam uses this book to break down our societal shortcomings using the combination of logic and humor that heâ€™s perfected. He made me glad that I never leave the house. Going out entails interacting with the general public, and the general public is dumb (no offense to those of you in the general public). And when I say dumb, I donâ€™t mean the innocent kind of dumb like a dog that thinks his reflection is another dog. I mean the dangerous kind of dumb, like Lennie in Of Mice and Menâ€”good-natured, mentally limited, and tremendously powerful. You leave your house one morning to get groceries, and you end up getting your neck accidentally broken by the guy giving you directions out of the parking lot.

In Fifty Years Weâ€™ll All Be Chicks is less of a book, and more of a guide for how to be a better man and/or woman (mostly man). Buy this book. Donâ€™t buy it because I told you to; buy it because itâ€™s funny. Buy it if you think Phillips Head is an alt rock band or if you wear V-neck T-shirts. Definitely buy it if you call appetizers â€œtapasâ€ or if â€œLOLâ€ is anywhere in your vocabulary. Buy this book and study it.

Review
"Laugh-out-loud funnyâ€¦ [Adam Carollaâ€™s] invective-filled screed is often completely politically incorrect, and always completely hilarious."
â€“AOL's Popeater.com

"If comedy books were big-breasted porn stars, In Fifty Years We'll All Be Chicks would be Christy Canyon."
--Bill Simmons, ESPN columnist and bestselling author of The Book of Basketball

"Adam Carolla is a genius. And no, I'm not kidding."
--Jimmy Kimmel

"Reading Adam Carolla is akin to having a horrible illness. Alone with your thoughts, you struggle with whether you want to even go on living. When you're done, you're a stronger, better person."
--Alec Baldwin

"If youâ€™re a man, read this book.  If youâ€™re a man who wears turtlenecks, wise up.  Nobody thinks that looks good."
--Seth MacFarlane

â€œI donâ€™t know this guy from Adam, but Carollaâ€™s humorâ€”fearlessly crass, shamelessly honest and irresistibly funnyâ€”sucks out like liposuction the  layers of fatty pride to expose the often warped and wounded psyche buried deep within the modern American male.â€
--Ken Burns
