From Wiki:

The Pillars of the Earth is a historical novel by Ken Follett 
published in 1989 about the building of a cathedral in the 
fictional town of Kingsbridge, England. It is set in the middle 
of the 12th century, primarily during the time sometimes called 
the Anarchy, between the time of the sinking of the White Ship 
and the murder of Thomas Becket. The book traces the development 
of Gothic architecture out of the preceding Romanesque 
architecture and the fortunes of the Kingsbridge priory against 
the backdrop of actual historical events of the time.

Before this novel was published, Follett was known for writing 
in the thriller genre. The Pillars of the Earth became his 
best-selling work. The book was listed at no. 33 on the BBC's 
Big Read, a 2003 survey with the goal of finding the "nation's 
best-loved book." The book was also selected for Oprah's Book 
Club in 2007. A sequel, entitled World Without End, was 
released in October 2007.


From Publishers Weekly:

Tom Builder's dream is to build a cathedral, but in the meantime, he must 
scrounge about to find a lord that will hire him. His search pulls him and 
his family into the politics of 12th-century England, as different lords 
vie to gain control of the throne in the wake of the recently deceased 
king. Prior Phillip, a man raised in the monastery since childhood, also 
finds himself drafted into the brewing storm as he must protect the 
interests of a declining church.


From Ken-Follett.com

...He then surprised readers by radically changing course with The Pillars 
of the Earth, a novel about building a cathedral in the Middle Ages. 
Published in September 1989 to rave reviews, it was on the New York Times 
bestseller list for eighteen weeks. It also reached the No. 1 position on 
lists in Canada, Greatand Italy, and was on the German bestseller 
list for six years.

It was voted the third greatest book ever written by 250,000 viewers of 
the German television station ZDF in 2004, beaten only by The Lord of the 
Rings and the Bible. When The Times of London asked its readers to vote 
for the 60 greatest novels of the last 60 years, The Pillars of the Earth 
was placed at No.2, after To Kill a Mockingbird [see my torrents for that
great book -FB]. (The sequel, World Without End, was No.23 on the same 
list.) In November 2007 'Pillars' became the most popular ever choice of 
the Oprah Winfrey Book Club, returning to No.1 on the New York Times 
bestseller list. 

In a time of civil war, famine and religious strife, there rises a 
magnificent Cathedral in Kingsbridge. Against this backdrop, lives entwine: 
Tom, the master builder, Aliena, the noblewoman, Philip, the prior of 
Kingsbridge, Jack, the artist in stone and Ellen, the woman from the forest 
who casts a curse. At once, this is a sensuous and enduring love story and 
an epic that shines with the fierce spirit of a passionate age.


The Pillars of the Earth mini-series (TV/Cable):
Ian McShane, Rufus Sewell, Matthew Macfadyen, Eddie Redmayne, Hayley Atwell 
and Donald Sutherland headline the star-studded cast for the eight-hour 
mini-series of The Pillars of the Earth, which premiered in the United States 
and Canada on Friday 23 July, 2010.
