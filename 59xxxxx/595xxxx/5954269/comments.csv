,PDXFletch,2010-11-14T03:01Z,"Ummm....I may be missing something but this is a free download on Adobe.com and you block the activation ports in Little Snitch:

These are the steps to a happy CS5 experience:

1. Run the Block Adobe Activation app.
2. If you haven't downloaded CS5 yet do this:
	i. Go to: http://www.adobe.com/ap/downloads/
	ii. Select the trial of your choice.
	iii. Log in/create an account (or use one of these)
	iv. Download your file, go make some coffee, it might take a while.
3. Install as a trial. Do not enter a serial yet!
4. Run one of the CS5 apps you just installed, and enter one of these serials:

1325-0621-9125-0765-3648-0614 
1325-0365-5929-6118-8817-8422 
1325-0150-1163-7532-1626-3430 
1325-0178-1927-9019-0123-2254 
1325-0702-3693-1544-9166-3515 
1325-0549-2240-0071-3409-1342 

5. You're done! Enojy!

FYI, these serials are good for any of the following apps, if it's not listed, it probably won't work:
AdobeÂ® PhotoshopÂ® CS5 Extended
AdobeÂ® IllustratorÂ® CS5
AdobeÂ® InDesignÂ® CS5
AdobeÂ® AcrobatÂ® 9.3 Professional
AdobeÂ® FlashÂ® CatalystTM CS5
AdobeÂ® FlashÂ® Professional CS5
AdobeÂ® FlashÂ® BuilderTM 4 Standard
AdobeÂ® DreamweaverÂ® CS5
AdobeÂ® FireworksÂ® CS5
AdobeÂ® ContributeÂ® CS5
AdobeÂ® PremiereÂ® Pro CS5
AdobeÂ® After EffectsÂ® CS5
AdobeÂ® SoundboothÂ® CS5
AdobeÂ® OnLocationTM CS5
AdobeÂ® EncoreÂ® CS5
AdobeÂ® Bridge CS5
AdobeÂ® Device Central CS5
AdobeÂ® Media Encoder CS5
AdobeÂ® Extension Manager

E-mail me for the script, but I got it here.  ;-)

If I'm please correct me.
