                    Manny Pacquiao V Antonio Margarito                     
                                                                           
   The clash of two KO Kings guarantees a "Road to Destruction".           
                                                                           
   "Pound for Pound" champ, Manny Pacquiaos reign of terror is under      
   serious threat from a man whos violent intent knows no bounds, three   
   time world champ, Antonio Margarito.                                    
                                                                           
   Pacquiao continues to defy logic. How can a man, who started his career 
   as a tiny flyweight, continue to maintain KO power all the way up to    
   welterweight and beyond?                                                
                                                                           
   His achievements set him apart, and it proves he is not just the best   
   fighter on the planet but one of the greatest of all time.              
                                                                           
   When his proposed superfight with Floyd Mayweather fell through, the    
   expectation was that the Filipino would have bided his time and faced a 
   couple of warm bodies in the hope it would entice Mayweather out of his 
   self-imposed hiatus. But not so!                                        
                                                                           
   Instead, Pacquiao has chosen the extremely threatening Antonio          
   Margarito, who has fought and beaten the best the welterweight and super
   welterweight divisions have to offer.                                   
                                                                           
   Margarito knows this is his chance to create history for himself, while 
   at the same time, line his pockets with riches he could only ever have  
   dreamed of as a young man struggling to survive on the streets of East  
   LA.                                                                     
                                                                           
   It's simply the match-up of the year.
