,Stillborne,2010-11-16T07:33Z,"the Australian guy keeps interrupting the fights with his annoying voice just to tell you they will be showing a re-run of the Hagler Leonard fight from 1987. It happens the whole time! They even cut off the national anthem and dont show any interview follow ups after the fight so they can tell you about the re-run again! Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad torrent! So very, very bad!"
