,mahani,2010-11-13T09:57Z,"Finally finished dl about half an hour ago (yeah, I'm seeding like hell).

However after installation, I got an error-msg, that TWII wasn't installed properly. If you get this message uninstall and reinstall. Make sure, you got no other TWII-Installation beforehand!

Seems to work for now. Thnx :)"
,mahani,2010-11-13T10:06Z,"Oh gawd!

Nvm what I said earlier. I get a screen in the menus ""A hardware configuration change has been detected. blah blah blah... please register online or by phone.""

This is just SO frustrating. The keygens in the other releases don't work for me (""File corrupted! This program has been manipulated or maybe is infected with a virus or cracked. This file won't work anymore"") and this release doesn't work for me either (see above). :(((("
,cyborg34573,2010-11-13T12:45Z,"Is this release nuked or what?. I cant get this to work, i always get the ""Game not installed properly"" error. I checked the installation folder and its only 3.32GB installed, I thought it needed atleast 6gigs?, somethings wrong. Ive reinstalled 3 times in 3 different locations (Uninstalling before reinstall ofcourse), still no luck. Ive also used the registry fix and edited it to put in custom installation folder location but still no luck. Wtf i waited 2 days for this to download (very slow internet) and its not gonna work?, well thx alot.

If anyone knows how to fix the ""game not properly installed"" error, pls help me out. I dont feel like downloading the reloaded version as that would take a week or soemthing."
,cyborg34573,2010-11-13T12:57Z,"""Game not installed properly"" error =.=
For some reason its only installing 3.32gb.

,naga3,2010-11-13T13:57Z,this is d first game i have had to install wen downloading tptb torrents...so help us...!!:(
,naga3,2010-11-13T14:26Z,well... seeding now... but wat do i have to do to make it work...
,mahani,2010-11-13T15:18Z,"Okay, I managed to play it :)
Here's, what I did:

1. Uninstall the game completely, using the unins000.exe
2. Install with ""Complete""-Settings in default-folder (!!) ... should be ""C:\Games\TPTB\Two Worlds II\"" and default start-menu-links
3. start the game ... well, at least, it started for me

If you managed to start the game, there's the problem with the key. Well, just ignore it for now (Don't register, don't enter key). It will let you play the first chapter (tutorial-chapter). After that, the game again asks you for a key. THAT is the point, when you use the keygen ( ""http://www.btarena.org/games/two-worlds-ii-reloaded"" in ""cracks/keys"").

If you have a problem running the key (""File corrupted... blah blah""), download and install a virtual machine (virtualbox.org i.e.), install a virtual WinXP and try the key there. That worked for me.
Hope this works for you as well.
"
,sharmila123,2010-11-13T15:46Z,"Nope tried that twice it didnt work for me...
are you lying ????"
,sharmila123,2010-11-13T15:49Z,"Ok i want to ask that once we have downloaded these files do we have to save them in a particular folder or no...
IF no then why is the game only installing only 3.39 GB .. do we need to rename any of the files again to make it work..
mahani how much is the space occupied by the game???"
,sharmila123,2010-11-13T15:55Z,DO we need tO restart the game after instALLIATION
,mahani,2010-11-13T16:13Z,"What... for what reason would i be lying?
No, I'm not lying. It worked for me. Had my difficulties as well with all that ""Game not installed properly"" and just reinstalled about three times. It worked, when I left the installation folder at ""default"" so i guessed, that would do the trick.

Installation folder is 3,32GB exactly. (47 files, three folders."
,sharmila123,2010-11-13T16:23Z,"Is this a stand alone version of the game??????
Ok so this is not a fake claimed by mahani..???
Do we need Reloaded version first??"
,cyborg34573,2010-11-13T16:32Z,Nope it doesnt work. Ive installed/uninstalled/reinstalled in the same default location more than 3 times now and im still getting that bs error. This s*cks
,sharmila123,2010-11-13T16:33Z,this is really shit  CHATBARS HELP US HERE PLZZZZZZZ
,sharmila123,2010-11-13T17:01Z,"mahani i didnt understand by the default installation folder you mean C:\Games\TPTB\Two Worlds rite????????? I have tried it for the fifth time...
tell me one thing .. i tried installing in XP and Vista both wid SP 2 ... ...is it a compatibility problem then??? which OS are you using

ANYONE OUT HERE PLEASE THROW SOME LIGHT INTO THIS MATTER "
,cyborg34573,2010-11-13T17:07Z,"Nope , im done with this torrent. Ive actualy reinstalled more than 10 times now, still not working. This release is nuked."
,mahani,2010-11-13T17:10Z,"Well, you checked the content of the .reg-file in your download-folder and made sure the lines point to the directory, where the binary is located and afterwards executed the .reg-file, right? (should be something like ""DataPath""=""C:\\Games\\TPTB\\Two Worlds II"" and so on..)
Otherwise, I rly don't know what else to do on my end.

And no, it's def. not a fake... an uncomfortable and perhaps buggy installation-process but no fake."
,mahani,2010-11-13T17:23Z,"Running it at a Win7 64b Machine.

Perhaps try installing the ""Reloaded""-Version. It should work as well and install a lot smoother (not to mention the dl-speed is much better).

Still, you got to manage the keygen-problem, if it's the case. Use the above mentioned solution (virtual machine).
And only enter the key, when first chapter ist done and the game asks you for a key(!). Heard, there are some problems, if you enter the key directly after installation. "
,cyborg34573,2010-11-13T17:23Z,"I have done everything i can to make it work.
Ive tried the default install location more than 10 times now and that has failed everytime.
Then i tried another partition (D in my case), And ofcourcse i edited the registry entry file. I Changed
""""DataPath""=""D:\\Two Worlds II""""
""""OutputDir""=""D:\\Two Worlds II""""
""""UninstallFolder""=""D:\\Two Worlds II""""

Still with the registry entry fixed the game still refuses to work.

The game is certainly not a fake. But the installation program is just nuked, its not working properly. If you get it to work then you are VERY lucky, because im guessing it chooses to work randomly."
,sharmila123,2010-11-13T17:27Z,"No i didnt understand registry part care to tell how to change the registry key thing...
thanking you

I'm sorry, TPTB but fix your release (including installation & noisy cutscenes) and then return :(
