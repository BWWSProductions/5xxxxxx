BTW if there was a way to get you a green skull I'd do it, I've already looked into it, and apart from possibly getting banned, there really isn't a way to ask :("
[T],insinuendo,2010-11-17T20:52Z,"LOL!

As someone once said, it's not the color of the skull that matters, but that you ""put out"" ;)"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-11-18T07:28Z,"true that :D

as for the torrent, im gonna go with the UHQR, it's clearer and more steady sounding than the others, plus the second one is kinda dirty :P"
