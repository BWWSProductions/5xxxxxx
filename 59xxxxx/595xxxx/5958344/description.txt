The Dark Side of the Moon is the sixth studio album by English progressive rock group Pink Floyd, and was released in March 1973. The concept album built on ideas explored by the band in their live shows and earlier recordings, but it lacks the extended instrumental excursions that characterized their work following the departure in 1968 of founding member, principal composer, and lyricist Syd Barrett. The Dark Side of the Moon's themes include conflict, greed, the passage of time and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by Barrett's deteriorating mental state.

The album was developed as part of a forthcoming tour of live performances, and it premiÃ¨red several months before studio recording began. The new material was further refined during the tour and was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road Studios in London. The group used some of the most advanced recording techniques of the time, including multitrack recording and tape loops. Analogue synthesisers were given prominence in several tracks, and a series of recorded interviews with staff and band personnel provided the source material for a range of philosophical quotations used throughout. Engineer Alan Parsons was directly responsible for some of the most notable sonic aspects of the album, including the non-lexical performance of Clare Torry.

The Dark Side of the Moon was an immediate success, topping the Billboard 200 for one week. It subsequently remained in the charts for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988, longer than any other album in history. With an estimated 45 million copies sold, it is Pink Floyd's most commercially successful album and one of the best-selling albums worldwide. It has twice been remastered and re-released, and has been covered by several other acts. It spawned two singles, "Money" and "Us and Them". In addition to its commercial success, The Dark Side of the Moon is one of Pink Floyd's most popular albums among fans and critics, and is frequently ranked as one of the greatest rock albums of all time.

Authors Comments:

I've heard quite a few vinyl rips of DSOTM and I still felt there was something more this format has to offer. I went in search of it and decided I will finally post something that I feel is up to my tastes and listening preferences.

This community has given me so much new and good music, that I am completely humbled by it.  I feel privileged to be able to share our one common passion that binds us all...the music.  We come from all walks of life, but truly become one in our musical spirits within this wonderful community.

This is my way of saying thanks for everything.

The next version was already upped at Demonoid, but not well seeded, so I decided to include it in the pack.




Pink Floyd - The Dark Side Of The Moon (Vinyl MFSL UHQR 24Bit 96kHz)

Flac 24/96 extraction of the UHQR album. I haven't done the rip myself but decided to upload it to demonoid since there's only a flac 16bits version on this site. The quality is good and it's worth downloading if you're a fan of this album, at least just for the experince of listening this particular version.


Equipement used:
Recorded at 24/96 there is no post processing whatsoever - what you hear is what is on the vinyl. This is an excellent copy but even after cleaning there are still one or two clicks and pops. Feel free to remove them if you want - they do not bother me.

As usual before converting this excellent copy to FLAC the record was cleaned on a Loricraft Pro cleaning machine using L' Art du Son cleaner. It was transcribed on an SME20/2 turntable with SME V arm and Koetsu Rosewood Platinum Signature cartridge to a Krell KPE reference phono amp and on to a Steve Huntley modified Audio Research LS22 tube pre amp. The ADC was an e-mu 0202 and the sound was captured on Audition 2. All cables are Grover Silver reference. Monitoring was via an Audio Synthesis DAX Discrete DAC, Krell FPB400cx power amp and Wilson Benesch speakers with Velodyne DD-10 sub-woofers.
