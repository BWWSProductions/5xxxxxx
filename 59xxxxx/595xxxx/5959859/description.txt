Genre: Reality


Description:
Making Australia Happy - Eight ordinary people from one of Australia's 
most miserable areas embark on a search for happiness. Over eight 
weeks they work with an elite team of experts to see if we really can 
learn to be happier.

Episode 1:
The experiment begins in Marrickville, the heart of an area recently 
identified by Deakin University's annual wellbeing index as one of the 
unhappiest in Australia. As we meet the eight volunteers, we learn 
that their happiness levels are way below the national average. The 
team of experts has just eight weeks to change the volunteers' 
scores, and their lives.

How will socially phobic Cade cope with the challenge of connecting 
with strangers at the local mall? Can mindfulness really help 
stressed-out real estate agent, Tony? Will gratitude help father-of-
four, Stephen, strike that elusive work-life balance? How can the 
youngest of the volunteers, Ben, benefit from writing his own 
eulogy?

Science claims that happiness is easily within our reach, but how will 
these scientifically validated techniques play out in the lives of 
ordinary Australians? The results are more than startling.
