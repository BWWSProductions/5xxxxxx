File Name .............: Unreported World S20E04 - Mexico's Indian Rebellion (22 October 2010)

In the mountains of southeastern Mexico, Unreported World finds 400 members of an indigenous community, who are fighting for independence, holed up in bullet-ridden homes and surrounded by a militia in an unreported war.

Reporter Evan Williams and director Alex Nott visit Yosoyuxi, a neighbouring village to the besieged town of San Juan Copala. Members of the local Triqui Indian community, fed up with years of conflict and government corruption, are attempting to break away and set up their own mini state, but locals tell Williams that those supporting the movement face extreme violence.

As the violence continues and the world's attention is focused on the Mexican drugs war, this largely ignored vicious civil war amongst the Triqui Indians is yet another sign that the country is fast spiraling out of control.
