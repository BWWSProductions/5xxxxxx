,dallanlee,2010-11-21T02:36Z,"THANK YOU FOR THIS UPLOAD!

Note: Is this file glitching at 30 minutes in for about 10 seconds for anyone else besides me? (It's when Ariadne and Cobb are walking in Cobb's dream and she is ""architecting"" for the first time...)"

Yeh I'm having the same problem. It happens at a few points. The AVC video track is missing the 'CTTS' atom for frame timecode offsets. This causes the timecodes for such frames to be out-of-order, the 'CTTS' atom is needed for getting the timecodes right."
,yorup420,2010-11-22T14:55Z,yeah I'm having the same problem also happens later on in the movie gets a little too pixelated for a HD file
