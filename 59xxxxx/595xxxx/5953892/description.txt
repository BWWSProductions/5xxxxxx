Portugal 1813

Action and romance follow Sharpe as his chosen men risk their lives on dangerous and heroic missions. Sharpe has to do battle with a gang of deserters led by an evil renegade, who uses hostages - including Sharpe's old flame - as innocent pawns in his wicked game to win a ransom. This is only the beginning of the problems facing Sharpe. A far greater threat is on the horizon. One where failure would mean the end of the war for the Allied armies.
