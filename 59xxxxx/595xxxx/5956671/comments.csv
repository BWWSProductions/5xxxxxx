For me (seeking ""Lovely To See You Again"") it only played the first 30 sec or so, then skipped, then a moment later just started playing the next song. I tried to repair the MP3 file using ""MP3Trimmer"" (by deepNiner) and it informed me this file was unrepairable. I also discovered track 3 skipped badly, and so I'm discarding this entire torrent. Thanks to the uploader, but curses to the ripper for a crappy job."
