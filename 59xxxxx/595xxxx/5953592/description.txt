Bopup Communication Server version 3.3.19.8893
Corporate instant messaging server for secure business communications
========================================================================

[OVERVIEW]

Bopup Communication Server is a secure messaging suite designed to 
provide efficient and private communication over networks of any size. 
The server meets most of the critical business needs, such as 
centralized management, the Active Directory (LDAP) support, message and 
file transfer logging. It can be easily deployed over the business 
infrastructure to unite the entire company's offices and other locations 
into one internal IM workspace with control over messaging groups, user 
permissions to view others and send messages and documents, a message 
and transfer archive with printing support. 

Since the server stores and delivers offline messages and files, users 
never lose information they are supposed to receive. Messaging is 
encrypted with strong algorithms so personal and group conversations are 
safe and secure even if data is sent via the Internet. Users can send 
messages with formatted text, links and graphic emoticons (smileys), 
organize their personal Contact Lists, access their contacts from any 
workplace and see who is online and available for communication. 
The client software can be configured on the server to run in the 
Confirmation Mode, which means that the client pops up every time a new 
message is received and keeps the window on top until the user confirms 
the message. 

To crown it all, Bopup Communication Server is fast to deploy and easy 
to use. It has a great and flexible user interface and comes with a 
built-in messaging system for scheduled and planned user notifications 
including the File Distribution system that offers a managed 
distributing documents to users. Client instant messengers can be easily 
installed and distributed via Group Policies with the support of 
pre-installed settings. 


Key features:

SEDURE AND PRIVATE COMMUNICATION
All transmitted messages and files are encrypted with strong encryption 
algorithms based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and CAST-128 
algorithms. That is the first and primary way to make corporate 
and business IM safe and secure. 

AUTHENTICATION MODES
The server supports various modes to authenticate and authorize 
connected users. Choose the best way for your corporate and business 
infrastructure from the available authentication modes: Simple, Windows 
Authentication (SSPI) and Private login/password.

MESSAGING GROUPS
The centralized management of user groups makes it possible to organize 
a flexible IM structure with a list of assigned groups and 
send/receive-only permissions set for each user. 

USER ONLINE STATUS
Online statuses allow users to see the current status of each user in 
their Contact List, i.e. Online, Away, Offline/Not available and control 
their own status. 

CONTACT LIST ACCESS
Users can organize personal Contact Lists and access them from any 
workplace and location. Users are informed if there are new contacts 
available on the IM server and if they can be added to their Contact 
Lists. 

OFFLINE FILE TRANSFER AND URGENT MESSAGING
Enable message exchange and file transfer even if some users are 
currently not available. Offline messages and files are automatically 
delivered by the IM server to the recipient when the latter goes online. 
Send urgent messages for high-priority tasks and notifications. 

FILE DISTRIBUTION
Easy, managed and secure distributing files and directories to client 
workstations. Important documents can be assigned and delivered to users 
from the server in a fully automated mode with a set of advanced flags. 

TERMINAL SERVER SUPPORT
The client software fully supports the Terminal Server, Citrix 
environments and the Windows XP Fast User Switching feature. Users can 
communicate even if they are connected to the same server via Terminal 
Client sessions or have open logon sessions on the same computer 
simultaneously. 

CONFIRMATION MODE
Activate the Confirmation Mode which pops up the client messenger when 
a message is received and keeps it on top of other windows until the 
user clicks the Confirm Message button. That is the best way to attract 
users' attention. 

CENTRALIZED NOTIFICATION
Send notifications and urgent messages and keep users updated on any 
events and information. These messages are automatically delivered by 
the server at the scheduled time at the specified intervals. 

MESSAGE AND TRANSFER LOGGING & ARCHIVING
Browse, search and view the entire message and file transfer archives. 
Print information for any period and for any person. 

INSTANT IM CLIENT UPDATES
The messaging clients can be instantly updated from the central IM 
server. This feature allows to keep IM client versions up-to-date and 
deploy new software updates and patches in a completely automated way 
without having to manually install it on all user computers.

ACTIVE DIRECTORY (LDAP) SUPPORT
Import user accounts from a global catalog and create the local users 
database on the server within a few seconds. Import accounts by choosing 
different criterias: by Organizational Units (OU) or by Groups. 
The server also provides integration options with a directory and can 
search and import accounts "on-the-fly" when new users connect.

ACCESS FROM A COMMAND LINE INTERFACE
Control the communication server and send messages directly from 
a command line interface. Send scheduled and instant messages to users 
and groups from third-party applications, scripts or batch files.

FAST TO DEPLOY AND EASY TO USE
Neither experience nor special skills are needed for installing the 
server. Just go through the steps of the Setup Wizard and get your IM 
system running in a few minutes.
