I don't watch HBO boxing. so I have no slightest idea was 24/7 episode right one. It was tagged as "Part 4", but, as I said...
The fight too.
So, please, check supplied screen-shots first to see was it right one or not.
Quality is webrip, decent and watchable. Definitely small-sized. Enjoy... and don't bitch about. I've done what I can.
