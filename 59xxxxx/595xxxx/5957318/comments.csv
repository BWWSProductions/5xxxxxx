,X3MEX,2010-11-15T06:24Z,"i like the idea of small size x264rip in some of new movies..but ur rips quality is just too pixilated in my 19inch LCD.. (especially with a movie with a lot of movements)
would it hard for u  to push ur videobitrate a bit more? lets say 900kb/s..and use a proper (HD)source  ...

[V],twentyforty,2010-11-15T07:21Z,@ DMVIN: Loaded. Hurry.
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-15T07:49Z,"@X3MEX: Well, after such smooth approach you can be sure that I will. Do... following:

I have 23.5 "" LCD and you speak - rubbish. Other million people have display like you - and they keep coming. At least dozen with true big-ass TV download my stuff regularly and have said, right here, gazillion times - just opposite.

It remembers me on conversation I have: 

""CBS has pixelated airing. Very ugly stream."" - one said.

""I have not seen that."" - was the answer.

""No, no - for sure. Just capture any portion of the video, magnify in any program for drawing by 10000 - and you'll see for yourself..."" - man said.

""Well, I wont. I usually do not watch TV through magnifyng glass. I watch TV from sofa and have no problems like you. BTW, do you look perfect 
under the microscope? I don't think so."" - was final word.

The point being - go someplace else. And - shut the f... ont door."
