This is a very good book that I would recommend to any manager. I also think many employees would learn a lot from reading this book as well. The main reason is because the book talks very little in the way of leadership or inspiring your people. This is a book primarily focused on process and quality improvement, but learning about leadership and inspiring my employees is the reason I bought this book. 

To me, the difference between a manager and a leader is that the successful manager gets his people to do what needs to be done. A successful leader gets his people to want to do what needs to be done. There was a lot more information on that topics in The Team Handbook, which Scholtes co-wrote.
