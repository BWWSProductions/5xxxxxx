[V],scene4all,2010-11-14T05:47Z,"Sorry my bad, i forgot to delete that file from the folder."
,djammad,2010-11-14T06:43Z,Works!!!! Thanks scene4all :D
,aaltoha,2010-11-14T10:46Z,"Doesnt work. Still getting ""The serial number entered does not provice required level of access"" when I try to use it on chapter 2."
,Vvornth,2010-11-14T11:49Z,"The keygen that's included with the game worked for me at chapter 2, maybe it is this one that's bad? :)"
,OmniNegro,2010-11-14T16:37Z,"While the user who added this torrent seems quite legitimate, I would not touch this for a few days. It seems to be lacking information. I checked the btarena site and they have a blank page for this entry. Wait until there is something there. Good luck and thanks to scene4all for sharing."
,OmniNegro,2010-11-14T17:00Z,"The double-rarred keygen in this has an MD5 of 498B27C26E2E76E5BD0590C306D911D9

The original has an MD5 of EE2895CA1022F9CDB28D65FF1B9B07DE

So this may be real. I would only run it in a sandbox anyway, just to be certain it can not cause any harm."
,Gloogloos,2010-11-14T17:45Z,so does this still not work for chapter 2
[V],scene4all,2010-11-14T17:55Z,"LOL its up to you, if you want to download it then download it or else let someone else take your place. And just because i don't have a pink skull or a green skull doesn't mean i upload fake stuff."
,OmniNegro,2010-11-14T18:48Z,"@scene4all

Sorry. Please allow me to explain what I intended to convey.

This is a genuine release. And you are clearly legitimate. However, I am wondering if this release itself is real.

There is no information at this time to confirm or deny this release. I will wait and see. Thanks for the understanding. :)"
,paladan26,2010-11-18T00:05Z,"It seems to work, but you then get to the Email Account to get around..  No idea if anyone has figured out how to get around this, due to it checks the cd key with the server itself.."
,Ultrakonkret,2010-11-18T02:37Z,"It works for chapter 2, try generate different serials, then one comes up that works..."
,OmniNegro,2010-11-18T03:44Z,"@paladan26
With all cracked games you MUST BLOCK THE EXECUTABLE in your firewall. There are many ways to do this, but you must learn to do it. 

Google will explain it in detail if you ask it how.

I would spit out the answer here, but it depends on what firewall you use, or if none, what version of Windows.

If you want my suggestion, uninstall all the garbage antiviral crap and download Comodo. It will do everything you need. And Google will tell you how to set it up to work properly.

Keygens do not ever generate legitimate serials. They just generate serials the game itself will think is valid. The server will always reject you unless you have a real serial.

Do not ask for one. Good luck to you and everyone else."
,mlech,2010-11-22T05:44Z,"This works great, just play through the demo mode, then use this to get a serial, type in the activation code(INCLUDE THE HYPHENS, ####-####-####-####) and it will give you a good registration code.  and yes, you have to block the program in your firewall.  Thanks!"
,gianijoker007,2010-11-24T20:15Z,"i thing both of keygens work anyway
just some codes dont work
so needs to generate another code
until u find one that works
tnx anyway.....btw it asks again for chapter 3:P"
,Shoobox,2010-11-29T22:33Z,"doesn't work for chapter 4, seems there is no fix yet for chapter 4 hope there will be one soon"
,josh1003,2010-12-02T15:27Z,How do you block it with NOD32?
,unicron_tpb,2011-01-14T05:41Z,"NOD32? You should have the firewall on ""interactive mode"" so that every time a program tries to use the internet the first time it pops up a window to allow or block.

Pretty much every video game tries to connect the the internet now, so I just select always block when I play a game the first time."
,Redano,2011-01-23T00:49Z,Anyone knows how can i make it work with chapter 3?? cuz it says invalid code when i try :( :( :(
,Dirty42,2011-01-27T14:16Z,"TROJAN WARNING

Included is a file '5mb-bin', which is an archive, containing several encased archived, which finally include a VNC Viewer.

You don't need a VNC Viewer for a keygen."

,theRealKarmine,2011-02-28T06:10Z,its funny since most people dont use firewalls
,Draken_Gard,2011-03-03T22:55Z,"Hey, I try the phone activation but none of the numbers work. Do I need to keep regenerating ?"
,Zull3,2011-03-23T01:54Z,if u get stuck try another key or another...i used the old keygen included in the game iso folder. worx. great game btw
,FeralFang,2011-03-26T22:00Z,"hey ik how to block a program, but i just wanted to make sure the main executable was in the realitypump/twoworlds2 directory"
,darkoray,2011-04-22T14:58Z,"Well i have manage to get this to work through chapter 1. 

For those who need some more help. 

you don't need to call the number. simple steps to follow. 

1. Run the keygen at the end of the demo
2. Hit the generate button at the bottom. This will generate a CD key. Use that when it asks for a CD key. 
3. Once you have entered the CD key in game it will generate a activation code. Enter that code into the reloaded keygen and hit verify at the bottom. This will generate a verification code. 
4. Enter the verification code ingame. 

You should now have a working game. 

Ill post again once i get past chapter 4. "
,Zull3,2011-04-23T19:12Z,thx for this awesome keygen 
,Zull3,2011-04-23T19:15Z,block the exe by entering windows firewall..in win7 u just search for firewall
[V],matimike,2011-04-28T19:24Z,"works, thanks"
,invisible11,2011-04-29T00:01Z,Can anyone help? Every time I try to extract the key jen My Mcafee keeps on deleting it any help?  
,Aimar55555,2011-05-04T09:35Z,"@invisible11 you could just turn off your mcafee temporarely, and once you've copied the crack turn it back on again, the file will stay on the same place."
,wyrm780,2011-05-13T08:46Z,The Keygen works great but I've got a problem. Although I blocked Two Worlds II from accessing the internet via my firewall it still confirms the CD key with the server so after a minute of playing it requests the CD key again since mine was not valid. First time I booted it up though it only asked for a new one once then was good until I quit the game. Can anyone help?
,Dub2Drum,2011-05-31T21:42Z,IT WORKED!!!! WHOOOO SUPER THANKS!
,reyasl,2011-06-01T18:07Z,"how to block the game in windows firewall

unmark it

,Mariakko,2011-06-17T12:01Z,I've entered the serial key and gotten through to the activation point there. Then it give the option of internet activation or phone activation. What do I do here?
,Grufil,2011-06-23T14:12Z,"Won't work for me. I have blocked this from windows firewall and all that.

When I put code into game and verify and so on, after couple of minutes it throws again something ""demo is over"" or ""you have used invalid serial key"".

Sometimes it works until I next time start the game and again it asks serial key.

I haven't even gotten further than chapter 1 because of this."
,newmouse,2011-06-26T03:42Z,"I have had the problem with Two Worlds II repeatedly asking for the serial nearly every time its run.
Its disabled in the Firewall.
This DOESN'T happen if my Internet Connection is switched off.

I've decided that the game looks for a active Internet connection  & try's to verify the Serial.
If it doesn't find an active connection then it excepts the Serial as OK.
That is, it rejects the Serial just because it can' t verify it when the Game thinks it should be able to.
The only solution I have found that works & completely stops the activation requests is 
to edit Windows HOSTS file adding the entry 
""127.0.0.1       secure.zuxxez.com"" 
Just disabling TWII in the Firewall isn't enough.

You will have to Google around about working with that HOSTS file ...to complicated to detail here. @@@@  "
,Crolic,2011-06-26T22:06Z,"Works, but don't forget to add the ""-"" in between the numbers when entering the validation code :)

Correct: 1234-1234-1234-1234
Wrong: 1234123412341234"
,TheBatDad1989,2011-06-28T12:32Z,"@newmouse
Is that safe? as what you detailed before with it consistently asking me for the Key every 30 minutes even after registering is exactly what is happening D:( . "
,jacburn,2011-07-26T22:10Z,"I am on Chapter 3, and it says it needs the Serial Number to access Chapter 3, but none work.. Help?"
,l3fg8snj,2011-08-23T21:48Z,"For those having trobule with serial resetting/going invalid after chapter 1 or after a few minutes of play:

You must learn to BLOCK the program in the firewall. I tried just unchecking the program in the list of firewall programs, and that did NOT work.

Here is how you manually block a file in Windows 7:

1. Go to control panel (full view).
2. Click on Windows Firewall.
3. Click on Advanced Settings.
4. Click on Outbound Rules.
5. Click on New Rule to the right.
6. Select Program and click next.
7. Browse for the exe (in this case TwoWorlds2.exe in the install folder) and click open.
8. Click next, and make sure ""Block the connection"" is chosen. Click Next twice, and enter a name (e.g. Two Worlds). Finish.

9. If you want to be extra sure repeat steps 5-8 in the Inbound Rules tab as well.

10. Play. If you last quit the game after being prompted to put in a new serial and do the phone activation, you will probably have to do it one last time, but after that it will stick."

,Millor1,2011-09-15T14:28Z,How the hell do I get this to work? I downloaded it and unrared it... and I can't run the application I get  when I unrar it... and my game needs a serial key after the demo
