,makkaspliff,2010-11-17T22:47Z,"Excellent up from Slickinator. Super about time upgrade from the DVDFab 4 I been using for yonks.
Just used this version to backup a 6.5GB DVD to Generic .avi DivX and it did the job in 27minutes. The Fab4 was going to take 65 minutes.
A mention here about AV programs, the Avast v.5.0.677.0 I am using moved the Patch to its Chest when I opened the installer so I had to download the torrent again. I disabled the Avast for 10minutes before I clicked the installer this time. All good.
Works a treat and I'm seeding.
Thanks"

,makkaspliff,2010-11-20T12:37Z,"WHOOPS !!! Double post there. Sorry but Its ok by me, the up's worth it.
I been having probs with submitting comments to TPB and using browsers, messengers since I d-loaded a serial for Daemon tools pro 4.36.0309.0160 and got a damn dreaded lurrgy. The serial came from some site I googled for the serial and the damn thing opened to a malware that screwed my browsers: couldn't use them, wouldn't let me system restore, couldn't open in safe mode to give it the boot out, said I had 100's of malware, was spamming people and its illegal to spam and I face criminal action, but they could fix all that if I paid by credit card $US99.40. And gave the last 3 digits of my credit card as a security measure. I managed to get browser Flock on line, got malwarebytes pro and sorted that basta out pronto. Some ""Worlds Greatest Security Centre"" bollix going by the name of ""Thinkpoint"". 
It even had a Windows Logo on the damn thing !!!!
Apart from that, this up of Slickinator is clean as and works beautifully."

[V],Slickinator,2010-11-21T21:59Z,the patch gets snagged as a false positive its fine just disable your av and trust it
