"Glitter"

When Barney finds a copy of the Canadian kids show 
"Space Teens" starring Robin's alter-ego "Robin 
Sparkles," the gang learns more about Robin's past as 
a performer than they expected.

Sorry you got trash last week, issues here. Maybe
next time youll get lucky and the douchebags will
find a halfway decent source and do a proper encode
[Don't hold your breathe though.]

Enjoy :)
