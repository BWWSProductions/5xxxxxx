IF 'RELIGION F***ED UP THE WORLD', DOESN'T THAT MAKE YOU WONDER WHAT [???] RELIGION(S) DID IT, AND HOW, WHY, WHEN, WHERE..?
I CAN TELL YOU FOR SURE THAT JESUS CHRIST NEVER INSTITUTED TO KILL OR TERRORIZE IN THE NAME OF 'GOD'. THAT IS SOMEONE ELSE'S WORK. THEY MIGHT CALL THEMSELVES 'CHRISTIAN', 'PEACEFUL AMBASSADORS', 'GOD'S ELECT' OR 'BRINGERS OF LIGHT' AND WHAT NOT, BUT THEY'RE NOT [!!!] CHRISTIANS.

[Sorry for using all caps, by the way.. I just want to make sure that you see what I write. But I guess I can continue in a civilized way instead of SHOUTING, which is bad taste. really..]

It's NOT contributing to the 'unf**ing of the world' to hurl at what you don't really know too much about. I learned some of that the hard way. Did me good although I hate the pressure and pain of 'looking through the glass onion', but I'm still learning and it feels good all in all. 

At least I don't buy shit for gold anymore, and I've found true joy where I thought there was none. 'Flowers in the dirt, and devils in suits', just to make use of a couple of euphemisms.

..And you're free to contact me at: verifiremail@gmail.com, and I'll answer you and ask you as much and as best I know.
'Let us reason with each other..'
You know who said that?

[I'm not hijacking your upload, IC, I just want to take some of your pressure off.. I know you're tired now. I love you, my friend. I will remember you.. V.]"
