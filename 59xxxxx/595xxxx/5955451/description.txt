
Sometime back there used to be a blog
which hosted a lot of Christian Movie links. All the Movies were uploaded inby the blog owner himself.

But due to pressure from some movie producers, it was closed down. As per request from the blogowner, I am sharing this file which contains the list of all movies along with their download paths.

I would ask every Christian to do 2 things.

1. If possible please buy Christian movies. Do you know that there are 2.2 billion Christians on earth today. But only a privileged few, around 12% have the means and the accessibility to buy Christian films. Many Christians are too poor to buy movies or live in places where Christian films are not available. 
That's not all. Out of the 12% who have the means and accessibility to buy Christian media, only around 0.5% ever buys a Christian movie. In other words only 1 out of 200 Christians ever buys a Christian movie. Pathetic isn't it?

2. Please seed the movies. If possible make copies and distribute to your poor neighbors. And please do pray for the movie makers and their families.

Remember the Kingdom of Heaven is in you and so is the choice of Heaven/Hell. 

PS: If you need any specific Christian movie or have something to say then kindly send a mail to indianchristian2009@yahoo.co.in
