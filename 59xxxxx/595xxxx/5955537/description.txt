Cornerboys were a Halifax folk band consisting of Carl Poirier, Rob Currie, Remy O`Brien, and Kit Hunt. Their only CD, Dukes of Granville: Cornerboys Live at the Split Crow was released in 1996. The mooseTracks CD featured three songs off Dukes of Granville, plus their rap cover of Barrett`s Privateers by Stan Rogers. This CD was probably released in 1997 or 1998; there is no copyright date on the CD sleeve.


mooseTracks were promotional CDs included in cases of Moosehead Beer, starting in Fall of 1996. The CDs featured three or four songs by singers and bands from Atlantic Canada. The first promotion featured five bands, including The Irish Descendants. The promotion was repeated several times, at least through 1999. Moosehead, located in Saint John, New Brunswick, claims to be Canada`s largest independent brewery, though that`s like being the largest Chihuahua among wolfhounds.
