,hello40204,2010-11-14T14:31Z,what the heck . file 10 gb and other mini files of 2 to 1 gb . a real mess 
,poincy,2010-11-14T17:02Z,"This is the full blu-ray rip, that's why the files are the way they are, it's not a mess if you know what you're looking at."
,poincy,2010-11-14T17:05Z,"By the way, if you get a chance to post the 2nd and 3rd discs at some point, that would be great! Love to see what extras are on them before deciding if it's worth buying this a second time around. Thanks for the up!"
,juhz,2010-11-14T20:58Z,"This is probably a very very stupid question, but how does one play back this monster? I understand MKVs and other containers, but what's the magic with this? Somehow I don't think VLC or MPC is going to grok this. I haven't downloaded this torrent yet, but I will if I have something that can play it."
,hello40204,2010-11-15T14:46Z,"do not agree with this . i know what i am looking for.
i have the avatar 35gb movie .one file mts with the extra stripprd of and also languages .
the original file was almost 45 gb before stripping languages and extra with tsmuxer .
now this extended version present only the biggest file which is 10 gb , the rest is a bunch of small files of 2gb or less  . 
most of us use only a mts or mts2 or mkv file . easy to play with any software . assembling this to get the edition extended in a one file is not practical . most of us want to keep the movie without the extras and scenes.
so how would you propose to do so ?
so we can have the extended vs of this movie in one file without the extras ."
,hello40204,2010-11-15T14:47Z,"and by the way , other blu-ray rips do not present files that way . so not true what you say about being this way for most of blu-rays rips "
,billybob45,2010-11-15T17:18Z,how come this is unseeded ? many people are on 0.0% after over 13hours ! is dibyatpb seeding this or not ?
,poincy,2010-11-15T17:30Z,"Nobody said that this is the way ""most"" of blu-ray rips are done, I said this is a rip of the full blu-ray disc, so you could burn all the files straight to a 50gb disc and have an exact copy of the original in other words. If you simply wanted the movie, I'd suggest grabbing just the largest file in the BDMV/STREAM folder since that one will most likely be the movie itself. And just so you are aware, this isn't my rip or anything, I'm just trying to be helpful here. Once you have that file, you can convert it if you want to into whatever format you like, or better yet, grab one on TPB that's already done for you and a lot smaller already!

,bigdog787,2010-11-17T00:49Z,No seeders? 
,referhead,2010-11-17T09:45Z,im sorry but who in the hell would download a 45gb movie?? arent blank blurays only 25gb? so how in the hell would u even put this on a disc? this seems jus insane file size. there are other bluray rips on here that are 2.5gb. wtf?!?!
,yopepoy,2010-11-17T17:13Z,"there are disc what we called dual layer. and it's 50GB, by the way i am not going to download this monstrous size."
,weaping_reaper,2010-11-17T22:33Z,"Witch files are just the extras? I have the new Extended cut, but I want to know which files are all the Special features. "
,dlarrym1111,2010-11-18T07:28Z,"I don't know what software  is your client BIT TORRENT, but in TRANSMISSION, soon as it presents you with the prompt asking if you want to add the torrent to the Que, you can also UN-CHECK any of the files you wish to NOT upload. SO in my case, you just select the ""MOVIE FILE"" and do NOT place a check beside the files you don't want and there you go.... Happy downloading!"
,hello40204,2010-11-20T01:43Z,"poincy you are a moron, 
you do not read anything i say or very fast.
i repeat , and i know it is not your rip.
the biggest file in this mess is 10gb 
also a bad rip from this guy . because a good rip would not include all this fragments .
this is my 123 th blu-ray rip . so i know.
also i know how to convert . so i do not need your help on this .
and at last. why bother with this upload,

and all of you guys , why bother , since this upload is dead and not seeeding 100%. just for fyi."
,mysticbluebmw,2010-11-21T00:21Z,"Wow, hello40204, you're pretty dense.  The point that was obviously missed by you, was that poincy was stating this was NOT a conversion, but a one to one copy.  In other words, exactly as if you we're viewing the original disc.  I don't think you read very well.  This is as good as it gets.  I also don't see any problem with DibyaTPB sticking around to finish it."

""because a good rip would not include all this fragments... so I know""

You're an IGNORANT fool. This is obviously a perfect, untouched SOURCE rip of the original disk for those who know what's on the release. But I guess it completely slipped your mind that this has THREE different cuts of the film, yet designed for SEAMLESS viewing of each. LOOK at the clips! The 10gig one includes the leading up to and after the Hometree destruction part of the movie, a 45 minute sequence of the theatrical cut where nothing was added in the new versions. There's another 600mb file for the hunt sequence, and another 600mb one for Tsu'Tey's death. Each new clip from the special/extended has a few seconds of overlapping footage for context/integration with the original, AND additional clips with- why, of course, WITHOUT the new footage! There's quite a bit to sort through here, but if you're UNABLE do that then just stop your whining and go buy it!

This WAS a great upload- as good as it gets, until hello40204 came along with his idiotic bitching."
,JLTheDude,2010-11-23T21:22Z,"hello40204 - 

If you read the nfo, it states - 

""3 different cuts on the disc done with seamless branching.""

Might want to educate yourself on seamless branching so as not to appear foolish next time.  The contents of this torrent are the exact contents - with all the seamless branching - of Disc 1 of the Collectors Edition.

I find it difficult to believe someone on their ""123 th"" Blu-ray hasn't run across a disc with seamless branching yet.

As to this - 

""most of us use only a mts or mts2 or mkv file . easy to play with any software . assembling this to get the edition extended in a one file is not practical . most of us want to keep the movie without the extras and scenes.""

Before speaking for the majority, you might want to know what is is you're talking about.  ""Most"" people in the know would simply use the correct .mpls (not .m2ts), which is already identified in the nfo as 00003.MPLS.  That .mpls contains all the .m2ts files, seamless branched in their correct order.  If that information had not been included, you can simply run the contents of the disc through BDInfo to identify which .mpls correspond to which content.  

If your desire to have only that content of a single playlist in a  single.m2ts file that is easier for the uninitiated to deal with, simply run the correct .mpls file through tsMuxeR using the output option ""Blu-ray disc"".  All the branched .m2ts files will be assembled and concatenated together into one .m2ts, removing any overlapped/duplicate frames in the process."

For the best viewing experience without having to buy a blueray player I recommend:

Perhaps it is my system - I am using P4 XP.  Will try to see if it will stream to my PS3, otherwise will download the other 45GB torrent."
,chang104,2012-02-12T03:23Z,"To my earlier comment on 2012-02-10, I stand corrected.  The video plays fine now, on Potplayer, but not on VLC Player.  This was as a result of my having updated my drivers.  Now I will try to see if it will stream to my PS3 thru PMS."
