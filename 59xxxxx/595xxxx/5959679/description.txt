Falco - Der Kommissar [TopPop tv show].VOB 



HQ very rare tv show promo. AVRO's "TopPop" was the first weekly pop program broadcast on Dutch television. It ran from September 22, 1970 to June 27, 1988. 

"TopPop" was mainly filled with pop artists in the top pop studio, playing to their latest hit. During the years of 1970-1974, 1978-1981 and 1986-1988, the artists were selected by the choice of the Viewer. In the years 1974-1978 and 1981-1986, the National Charts were used instead.

"Der Kommissar" is a song first recorded by Falco in German in 1981, Originally written by producer Robert Ponger for Reinhold Bilgeri, Bilgeri turned it down as he felt the song was too soft, so Falco reworked the song for himself instead. 

It reached the top of the Charts in many countries, but only reached #74 in the US Cash Box Charts in 1983 and did not even chart in the UK, but Falco would break through with major hits in those countries two albums later, with "Rock Me Amadeus" and "Vienna Calling" in 1986. 

It was covered a year later by After the Fire and reworked in 1983 by Laura Branigan. After The Fire's version featured English lyrics by the band's Andy Piercy. The song peaked at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts.
