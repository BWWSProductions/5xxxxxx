Besides that point..... I find it rather ironic that a 'downloader' ask's us to do the right thing, considering the legal ramifications from Downloading in the first place.... LMFAO!"

Conan or the show will get zero money if there are commercials in this torrent! Do you know how commercials work anyway? As stated this torrent is illegal anyway. Do you think the advertising company would watch an illegal torrent and say ""oh 1000 people have downloaded this and seen our new advert, that's $1000 I'm sending straight to TBS""!!! What crazy fucked up world do you live in!!!!! lol"
