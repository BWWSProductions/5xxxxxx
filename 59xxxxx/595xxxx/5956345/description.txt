SiSoftware Sandra (the System ANalyser, Diagnostic and Reporting Assistant) is an information & diagnostic utility. It should provide most of the information you need to know about your hardware, software and other devices whether hardware or software. Sandra is a (girl) name of Greek origin that means â€œdefenderâ€, â€œhelper of mankindâ€. We think thatâ€™s quite fitting. It works along the lines of other Windows utilities, however it tries to go beyond them and show you more of whatâ€™s really going on. Giving the user the ability to draw comparisons at both a high and low-level. You can get information about the CPU, chipset, video adapter, ports, printers, sound card, memory, network, Windows internals, AGP, PCI, PCI-X, PCIe (PCI Express), database, USB, USB2, 1394/Firewire, etc.
