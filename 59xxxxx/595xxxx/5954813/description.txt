iPhone View Controllers Part I 

After months of production and over a year of anticipation, itâ€™s the first PeepCode Screencast on native iPhone application development! 

The iPhone is possibly the most revolutionary computer device of the last few years. The good news is you can learn to write native applications for it! 

Programming applications for the iPhone is radically different from writing web applications, but weâ€™ll take you through both the high-level concepts and the line-by-line code to understand it. While many tutorials show only fragmentary examples or trivial applications, weâ€™ll walk through a visual news application that fetches data from a web service and displays it with both custom and stock views. 

This 78 minute screencast covers: 

* Conceptual Overview 
* View Controller Basics 
* Callbacks 
* Code: Setup 
* Tab Bar Controller Concepts 
* Code: Tab Bar Controller 
* Navigation Controller Concepts 
* Code: Thumbnail Navigation Controller 
* Code: Web View Controller 
* To Be Continuedâ€¦ 

iPhone View Controllers Part II 
Our first iPhone View Controllers screencast (Part I) was an instant hit. This screencast completes it and continues the momentum in our new series of iPhone development screencasts. 

In this tutorial youâ€™ll become confident using the simple yet powerful table view controller. Youâ€™ll learn about layout, interaction, workflow, capabilities, and tips for working with tables. 

We go beyond simple usage to show how to use a custom cell that dynamically displays multiline text. And youâ€™re free to use it in your own projects, too! 

Rotation and modal controllers are explained with a sample project included. Explanation is enhanced by the informative diagrams and motion graphics youâ€™re used to seeing at PeepCode. 

We conclude with a priceless tour of troubleshooting tips that will help you write more reliable applications with much less pain.
