I'll step up!

I have no clue what I'm doing but I think I did this right. If there's a problem, let me know.

Enjoy!

Go Wild!"

Great work at uploading all these torrents. I regularly listen to coast to coast and it's just great. I do have one request to make, would it be possible to upload one file with all these included? I'm sure it would make everyone's life a little easier. If not, I could probably do it once I have acquired all the files."
