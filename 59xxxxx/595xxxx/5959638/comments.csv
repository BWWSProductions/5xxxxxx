[T],SgtRlee,2010-11-16T10:57Z,"Thanks for the comment pcvjs :) i was surprised not to find this promo on youtube, because most of the times it's posted there, though in a blocky flash video form, lol. i'll get a few more posted and seed for awhile before i play Black Ops again (love the zombie co-op + the C4 remote control car in multiplayer, best game ever made!)"
