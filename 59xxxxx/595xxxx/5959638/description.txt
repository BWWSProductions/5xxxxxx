Very HQ very rare (not found on youtube) tv show promo. AVRO's "TopPop" was the first weekly pop program broadcast on Dutch television. It ran from September 22, 1970 to June 27, 1988. 

"TopPop" was mainly filled with pop artists in the top pop studio, playing to their latest hit. During the years of 1970-1974, 1978-1981 and 1986-1988, the artists were selected by the choice of the Viewer. In the years 1974-1978 and 1981-1986, the National Charts were used. 

"Looking for Clues" is a song from Clues, Robert Palmer's sixth solo album, released in 1980. It has a rockier, new wave edge compared to his previous releases. The album peaked at number 59 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart and #31 in the UK in 1980. Donald Guarisco of Allmusic described Clues as "one of Robert Palmer's strongest and most consistent albums," despite being somewhat short at 31 minutes.
