,jayawarden,2010-11-14T21:30Z,"Thank You.
Please upload some Indian movies in Blu-ray or Blu-ray Rip dude...."
,yopepoy,2010-11-16T04:50Z,there is no need to comment on quality. we all know what it looks like. it's extremely awesome!
,nittany,2010-11-16T11:27Z,"I would skip this one, there are no subtitles for the non-english parts, secretmyth has never let me down until now.

There should be hard coded english subs, for those that have the movie go directly to the 1 hour 5 minute mark where she and the guy are talking in Russian....no subs.

I should have got another release, but I just assumed from all the good comments it had hard coded subs."
,nittany,2010-11-16T11:58Z,"These subs work but they are for everything, can't find any for just the non-english parts.

,rsl87,2010-11-16T23:06Z,is this cinavia protected like all the other dumbass ones?
,rsl87,2010-11-16T23:13Z,nevermind.. it is :(
,manu_rox2,2010-11-17T19:15Z,it's great to have you back!!!!
,nittany,2010-11-20T06:33Z,"One of the worst torrents from secret myth that I can recall.  First off, no hard coded subs for the non-english speaking parts....and not even a separate srt file for them as well.  If you didn't want to hard code them....ok, but include the srt file then.

2nd, this doesn't concern me since I play back my movies through my Popcorn Hour A-110 but people will PS3's can't play this movie back because of cinavia DRM.

At least warn people that play back their movies through PS3's that this movie will not work on them.

The quality is fine, but 2 thumbs down for this release.

,nittany,2010-11-26T08:46Z,"How can people like this rip, it's complete shit, no subs for the non-english parts.....do people not care about the dialogue?  "
,nittany,2010-11-26T11:50Z,"The torrent link below contains the subs for only the non-english parts of this movie.  Once you open the torrent the smaller .srt file is the one for just the non-english parts, the bigger .srt file is for all the subs.  It works fine, I used the subs below for the SecretMyth release that had no subs.

,ultamanl,2010-12-04T20:16Z,sigh.. another one that has copy protection which can't be played on ps3 :(
,DutchXL,2010-12-05T00:45Z,The quality looks great! But the audio is totaly out of sync.
,rustywire63,2010-12-05T05:44Z,Great upload thanks ........................
,crazyforher,2010-12-08T04:21Z,"audio sucks. Music and sound effects are fine, but you can't hear what the heck they are saying"
,yashsagar,2010-12-09T10:22Z,secretmyth plz upload the new AVATAR (special edition) in blu ray (1080p)
,amoghthegamer,2010-12-18T06:08Z,DONT DOWNLOAD! HORRIBLE SOUND!
,lotusdent,2010-12-21T14:29Z,Thank you.
,throwing_wheel,2010-12-22T06:38Z,"My audio playback also is badly out of synch and at times garbled.

Sometimes in theaters you also can't make out dialog.  That's due to a film's poor  sound editing, more often than not, not the playback equipment.  I don't know if that's the problem here.  I'll find out after I play a different dl.

Evidently, most aren't having trouble with the audio, or there'd be more complaints, but, there are enough complaints to warrant skipping this one.

Does anyone know a way to fix the audio synch?"
,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-01-12T14:11Z,"Secretmyth.... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do a brrip of ""Walk the Line"" 2005 starring Joaquin Phoenix. Please I'm begging you :) "
,slamminuk,2011-02-06T01:52Z,"Video and Audio work perfect for me. Watched on Power Dvd 10 and Media Player Classic. No out of sync moments.

Only thing missing is the Subtitles for the Russian speaking parts."
,GirishWinchester,2011-03-10T10:59Z,"Thanks for this! :) Its awesome! Not your best rip, but still, its awesome! And SM, we want you back! Please do more rips! "
