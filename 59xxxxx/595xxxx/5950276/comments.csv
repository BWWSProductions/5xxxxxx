Many Thanx to TvTeam for an Excellent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)

@bodthedog You've posted on the wrong Torrent, this is an AVI FILE not RAR. You must have downloaded one of the other Torrents, because this file is the dogs bo***cks..."

Just rename it to something shorter and it'll play fine."

,harry0266,2010-12-11T23:38Z,"Thanks TvTeam ;)

@ swanvestas""90210"" If your compu'TOR' is making a ""bonk"" noise... you might wanna upgrade from f***in' Windows '98. Better yet, unplug the keyboard, shove the cable in your nose. THEN, get a wire coat hanger and hold it in your left hand at a 30 degree angle to your right nipple... and go READ A FUCKIN' DICTIONARY!!!"
,paulderby,2010-12-18T23:45Z,"first bad download from tvteam, will not let u rename the file, will not let you convert it on convertxtodvd 4"
[T],FaeGiN,2011-01-26T20:06Z,"Thanks again TvT.
For those who have serious issues...and I don't just mean with the torrent!
TvT hasn't brought you as 'bad file' or anything of the sort!!
Windows can't handle it when you have really long names of files and especially if they are in long named folders..it gets too many and then windows wont play ball. It likely wont tell you what the problem is either so you have to just work it out by renaming the folder above the one the file is in...or the folder above that first...rename them to single letter names to start with.
Then go into the folder the film is in and select it, then press F2 then type a new name for the movie file.
If, as some say here, you CANNOT rename it (and you have done the renaming of folders it is in) then it is because windows has locked the file...it being a movie file. In that case get 'Unlocker' google it, and then right click on the damn movie file and choose..Unlocker, then choose RENAME. It will be done!
Hooraaaay!!!


All that just for a long file name. Shows you how windows sucks eh?"
,JohnTesh,2011-03-12T20:50Z,"actually, a lot of file systems limit characters to 255 characters. extract to the shortest directory possible and you're golden. seems like people will use losing their wallet as an excuse to bash windows nowadays.

anyway, thanks for the upload. "
