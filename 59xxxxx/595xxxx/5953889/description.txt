Part 1: Arrival.
In fifty years of broadcasting, Sir David Attenborough has travelled the globe to document the living world in all its wonder. Now he completes his journey by going back in time to the roots of the tree of life, in search of the very first animals. Attenborough's journey begins in a forest near his childhood home in Leicester, where a fossil discovery transformed our understanding of the evolution of complex life. Travelling to the fog bound coastline of Newfoundland and the Australian outback, Attenborough unearths the earliest forms of animal life to exist on Earth.
