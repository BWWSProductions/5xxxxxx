,k3nd00d,2010-11-13T07:36Z,Just an observation...the trutv.com website only now lists up to episode 5 for season 2. I am thinking they may have decided to split season 2 into two 5 episode blocks. So possibly next week's episode will be the last for the first half of season 2 and then the second half of season two will start in January with another 5 episodes or something like that. These are just my thoughts fueled by season 2 episode 6 no longer being listed at trutv.com (but it was and still is on the wikipedia page for the show).

,k3nd00d,2010-12-03T21:04Z,This episode has been banned. TruTv no longer lists it on their site's episode listing ( http://www.trutv.com/shows/conspiracy_theory/episodes/index.html ) and did not and will show any repeats of it after the original air date.
,k3nd00d,2010-12-15T14:42Z,"Nope, hadn't heard about it...probably some snow-job though."
,BakedUp,2011-01-30T23:47Z,"WILL SEED.
Good quality.

Thanks!"
