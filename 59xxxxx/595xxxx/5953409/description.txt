Album Info..:  

"Peace in the Valley: The Complete Gospel Recordings" is the latest offering from the
revolutionary Elvis producers Ernst Jorgensen and Roger Semon. This 3-CD box set
differs from many other recent Elvis releases spearheaded by Jorgensen and Semon for 
one reason: it features all previously released material.   

The kicker? Even the most avid Elvis CD collectors don't seem to mind.

This immaculate, comprehensive set needs no previously unreleased tracks to entice   
Elvis CD junkies like me. Likewise, the listener needs not be an Elvis Presley fan - 
or even a fan of traditional gospel music - to enjoy this collection. 

The music, digitally remastered from the original master tapes to produce the   
cleanest, crispest sound to date, captures Elvis at his emotional and spiritual best.
This set proves that gospel provided an anchor for Elvis's musical repertoire from   
day one, right up to the end. The consistency in vocal conviction from the "Million  
Dollar Quartet" sessions (recorded by a young Elvis on the brink of superstardom) to 
the live version of "How Great Thou Art" (recorded at one of Elvis's final concert   
performances) is both startling and revealing. It is indeed difficult to listen to   
these tracks and not feel swept away by the utterly convincing candor that carries   
Elvis's voice through every note.
