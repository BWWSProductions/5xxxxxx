This is a complete life story narrated as accurately as possible on the entire life of shivaji maharaj in the 16 th centuary- how he revolted aginst the then existing kingdoms with only a few loyal soldiers and managed to build up a hugh kingdom of his own. Belive me some of the narrations and stories are blood curling.

language is Marathi.

Enjoy everybody.
