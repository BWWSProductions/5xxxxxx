I was looking forward to playing the game too.
It's real, it works, the crack is here, but...
the game is B A D. Not worth even the time I spent trying to play it.
It looks like a low-budget PS2 game, that's it. 
boring gameplay, no difficulty at all, 2004-2005 graphics and almost no settings, boring soundtrack. "

For now it is about quad cores - that the game can't handle.. All you have to do is reduce NFS11.EXE process access down from 4 to 2 cores.

Also i donÂ´t know why, even with my 6870 the FPS isnÂ´t constant at 60, it oscillates down to around 40~50, with is ridiculous considering how simple the graphic of the game is even without AA.
I'm Running on a windows XP, 4gb ram, 3,0ghz Q6600. No problens with the crack and this ISO, just cancel the ""Activation"" when it appears in the installation."
,Dado1683,2010-11-17T19:20Z,come on man SEEDS!!!
,shinjimisato,2010-11-17T19:23Z,"ALso, the cars donÂ´t have all that personallity and lacks a little of realism (ok it's an arcade i know, but it snÂ´t in the sweet-spot of realism like GRID was for example)... I also thinks it's unforgivable the lack of cockpit view, traction control and manual gearbox... The style of the game is fun, but High Stakes, and Hot Pursuit were better mastered and this game and the graphics and realism of the game, should'be in pairt with GRID wich as a racing game is much better, even tough the proposal is different...

@Rawthang So that, we buy time downloading the CLONE Image in the day it's released and then 2~3 days latter only downloads a 2mega crack instead of the whole game wich should take another 2 days till the speed increase together with the initial seeders? This way we can play the game earlier. Kinda obvious isn't it?

Dude you are clearly the idiot here, who wasnt able to install a fucking copy-paste-replace crack.. geez."

Thank you to him. And to uploader. Now gotta hope the ""NFS14_Crack"" file I dloaded works.

And someone said this is having probs with quad cores... I wonder if it has problems with 6-cored systems? Hope not.. But I guess I can reduce the exe to use 2 cores, somehow like .. again; someone said. (Thanks to him aswell.)

But anyway thanks for the info people, thanks for the release and will seed. (Though my speed was all fine, coming at around 4mb/s - So I don't know why people are getting it slow :P)"

,Sarkasmi,2010-11-17T21:30Z,"Damn, getting the same ""Black screen on actual game start"" - probably because I have a multicored system. 

The fix for it is; Ctrl + Alt + Del and then right click on the NFS.exe and ""Set affinity"" in the process list. Then choosing eiter core 0 or core 1. At least so I read.

BUT I can't do it. Says something about not being able to set affinity as I'm not authorized to do so. (Rough translation from Finnish, as that's my system language...) 

Tried running as an administrator and setting the affinity but won't let me do it no matter what I try. 

Any help would be appreciated...

(Is it because I'm trying to set the affinity to a cracked .exe? hmmm or do I somehow have to allow this ""affinity setting"" from somewhere? 

Or is there a (cracked) patch or something around?

,davka0107,2010-11-17T21:56Z,"How to fix the crash:
1. Use this crack http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5959999/Need.for.Speed.Hot.Pursuit-Crack-%5Btracker.BTARENA.org
2. DISABLE or turn-off any anti-aliasing settings in your graphic software. Ex: in ATI Catalyst control panel, set 3D quality to Balanced
Now it shouldn't crash when you launch the career race"
,fittland,2010-11-17T21:59Z,"Works like a charm. until you start the game. then you have to logon to you'r EA acount, after getting by that progress you need to veryfy this by punch in the serial of the game. i have no serial since i download it here. so wats the point. how to play the game ??? that's my q???"
,Sarkasmi,2010-11-17T22:21Z,"fittland; 

Just pass the log on process by pressing esc and don't log in to the EA thing. Then you can play the single player career.. 

At least that's how I'm trying to do it, but haven't gotten it set to use only 1 or 2 cores, since my system has 6 cores and the game crashes when it's supposed to load the race. 

The menu's look pretty though ;P *trying to think positive* 

God damnit why won't my system let me set the affinity >:/"
,Sarkasmi,2010-11-17T22:32Z,"davka0107;

Well I be damned, it worked.

I already had that crack - went to the Catalyst Control Center and from 3D took the ""use custom settings"" mark off the box and set it to ""Balanced"" and works perfectly.

If you're on a vista/win 7 system, you could try right clicking the exe, then choosing propertities and ""run in compatibility mode"" windows xp service pack 3"" or ""windows vista service pack 2"" or so.

,tarunswm,2010-11-22T05:06Z,"if one play thinking thats its ""Burnout"" then game is awesome but if one play thinking NFS game is just a crap.The game much like burnout with official cars.
The feeling of NFS is not there.can't do customizations, cant performance upgrade etc.In name of customization one can only change colors of cars.
In first play i feel game is good coz i m also fond of Burnout but later feeling of NFS let me down.One can say that its just mixture if ""Hot Pursuit 2 and Burnout Paradise"" the real NFS is gone :(
Overall game is worth to download but don't consider it as NFS otherwise u'll regrate, think it just new version of ""Burnout"" with cops hehehhehehehe :) Well thats all me what i think of game but still worth to play

,Pole_Star,2010-11-25T23:06Z,"Works perfect fine. Thanks. :)

The game, well, its good at start but not so great later. Also, find the game AI a bit harsh, and controls bit tough."
,nogardd,2010-11-26T02:39Z,"It wasnt only EA who did the game.. Criterion was part of the creation. Even though Criterion games are all good, so most of the part isnt bad at all.. EA doesnt make good racing games anymore.. they ruined NFS starting ProStreet.. not sure as for the gameplay of this one"

P.S. Great game. Thanks uploader. Installing right now."
,alex203000,2010-12-01T23:54Z,"Solved the problem. In custom installation you can choose folder to install the game. But I have another issue, I have messed up the keyboard settings. I have Esc for Back and for Quit. I can`t acces settings because Esc key is sending me to quit the game. Enter key is useless. I tried to uninstall the game and reinstall but it`s the same problem. Any ideas ?"
