If some one need to hear 2ch, ask him to use kmplayer or vlc, something like that. Even i have 4.0 sound system. It doesnt fit to 2ch niether 6ch. But kmplayer makes out put to 4ch. So, PC guys never need, unless he do not know it. (Excuse me PS3 and others)

Keep it up bro, i watched ur releases. So, i mention above fact as Thanks and respect to u."
