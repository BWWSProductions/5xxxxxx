Finally, the wait is over. Billy Connolly, the King of 
Comedy, returns in his first brand new stand up DVD for three years.

As funny, topical and downright brilliant as ever, Billy 
Connolly: Live In London 2010 is the master at his best. 

From raging about Britain's political elite to reporting 
about the oddities of America, Live In London 2010 takes the 
audience on a hilarious series of anecdotes, digressions and yarns. 

Filmed during 20 sell out nights at London's Hammersmith Apollo, 
this is the show that caused a ticket website to crash from the 
demand when it first went on sale. Clearly, Billy Connolly is 
still the nation's favourite and now you can enjoy with this unmissable show.

Whether you've been a fan since the beginning or you want to 
see the very best of British comedy right now, you won't be disappointed.
