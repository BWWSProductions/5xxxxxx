The file named {2006 Jones, Ryan- 911 Revisited, Scientific and Ethical Questions, A New Standard for Deception.avi} is corrupt.  It is not a video file and cannot even be deleted from its folder. It caused my system to crash several times and restart and makes any disk it records to unreadable. Please look into the problem so others don't have this occur.

ANYONE DOWNLOADING THIS TORRENT, DO NOT CHECKMARK or INCLUDE THIS ONE FILE. Everything else (avi and pdf) seems fine. Great stuff with the professors and their findings with the thermite. Was mentioned also in 'Conspiracy Theory w Jesse Ventura'. 

Thanks litzwires"
