,sweaterpuppies1,2010-12-06T08:52Z,"The ""anonymous"" uploader for the mkv WEB-DL's is hardly ""anonymous""... it's Chouonsoku. And if you weren't aware they were just straight rips from the iTunes store, and only up to Ep11 (dual episodes) is avialable.

He uploaded all the files here to TPB. In fact all the torrents are all still up here.

So... anonymous?"
,thespace101,2010-12-15T01:33Z,We miss Chouonsoku

,killzoomer,2011-10-16T17:41Z,WARNING!!!! Absolutely horrible quality!!
,EmrysMyr,2011-10-23T21:45Z,i can't find the pilot anywhere! anyone got a link?
,mega48man,2011-11-03T03:53Z,"i was able to watch most of the windows movie maker files by right clicking and using free file viewer, but my computer crashed (for the 200th time ever) and now when i play them they are 2x fast and no sound. then after the theme song it slows down but still no sound. there's an option to play it in Itunes and that doesn't work, and when i open it in WMM there's nothing.

how do i play these files???"
,stephenball70,2011-11-25T02:15Z,"Killzoomer's just fuckin' with you, guys. The quality's actually pretty rad. "

,mattman15,2012-03-16T02:32Z,wtf i only get 4 episodes and the rest are .mkv files...
,Snorgdarf,2012-03-21T10:34Z,".mkv is a type of video file

you can play them with mpcstar, its free just google it."
,JackSomerville6,2012-04-10T23:45Z,Is it worth downloading?
,Soulvanisher,2012-04-15T01:18Z,hmm... .mkv try avi converter just like realplayer|converter or foxtab AVI converter
,binary99,2012-05-22T16:47Z,"to play .mkv files, you must either install a codec pack or download a player (recommended). that could be vlc, potplayer or gomplayer"
,FluffyBunyAlpha,2012-06-03T19:17Z,"Trust me, VLC is the way to go when it comes to media"
