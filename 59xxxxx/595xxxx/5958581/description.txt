Comments :
In a far away, long ago kingdom, Cinderella is living happily with her
mother and father until her mother dies. Cinderella's father remarries
a cold, cruel woman who has two daughters, Drizella and Anastasia. When
the father dies, Cinderella's wicked stepmother turns her into a virtual
servant in her own house. Meanwhile, across town in the castle, the King
determines that his son the Prince should find a suitable bride and provide
him with a required number of grandchildren. So the King invites every
eligible maiden in the kingdom to a fancy dress ball, where his son will be
able to choose his bride. Cinderella has no suitable party dress for a ball,
but her friends the mice, lead by Jaques and Gus, and the birds lend a hand
in making her one, a dress the evil stepsisters immediately tear apart on the
evening of the ball. At this point, enter the Fairy Godmother, the pumpkin
carriage, the royal ball...
