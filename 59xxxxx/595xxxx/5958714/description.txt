             Jeff Garlin, known by many for his role as Jeff      
              Greene on Curb Your Enthusiasm, returns to his         
               hometown and his comedy roots for his first             
               hour-long special. He performs to a sold-out             
               crowd at the historic Second City Theatre in             
              Chicago. Garlin is a wonderful storyteller and           
             enjoys the kind of comedy where if anyone looks         
             stupid, its him. So sit back, lie down or             
             stand up if you want for a night with Jeff             
             Garlin.
