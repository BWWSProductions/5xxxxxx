,RedKing13_ca,2010-11-25T02:43Z,"Original had a run time of 2hrs 10 mins..

this one is 1 hr 57 mins?

extended?"
,fakebest,2010-11-25T06:42Z,@RedKing13_ca where did you get this info about it originally being 2hrs 10 min compared to imdb that says 1 hr 47 min and extended 1 hr 57 min.  anyways Why is no one a making a brrip of this extended version I wish riddler or hd micro would make a 720p brrip so it would be the same quality as this but smaller than a dvdrip
