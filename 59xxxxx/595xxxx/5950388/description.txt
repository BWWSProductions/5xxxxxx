                         Death Wish â€“ Brian Garfield

Paul Benjamin is as far from Charles Bronson as you could imagine. Heâ€™s a middle-aged accountant who never bothers to exercise; heâ€™s put on weight and gone soft and weak. When tragedy strikes, he doesnâ€™t grab a gun and spring immediately into action. He grieves. Heâ€™s numb and confused. Increasingly, heâ€™s afraid. He walks around the city in which he grew up, and feels more and more threatened. He begins to fantasize what heâ€™d do in this or that situation where he feels threatened, and starts to carry around a makeshift weaponâ€“a roll of quarters in a sock. After an inglorious but nevertheless successful repulsion of a young mugger, he finally decides to take it to the next level and acquires a firearm.
In 1974, a film based on the novel was made, starring Charles Bronson and directed by Michael Winner.
