REVIEW:

Years ago I had a chance to see one of the director's previous works, the short film "The ten steps". That was great, brilliant idea, scary atmosphere. Director Brendan Muldowney now completed his first feature film, Savage, just hitting cinemas. As its title refers, Savage is shocking, brutal, and disturbing. It shows Dublin's inner part when anti-social behavior is a part of every-day life, especially nighttime. Our hero, Paul (Darren Healy) doesn't care too much about it â€“ actually, he makes a living of it by being a photographer -until he gets brutally attacked and that changes his life forever. A classic revenge tale, and as it is, there's no happy ending. We can see Paul changing, turning from quiet, shy guy into a real psycho. He tries hard to go on with his life â€“ medicines, self-defense classes, gym, but even love can't turn him back from the way he entered and when he get closer and closer to his destiny. Main actor Darren Healy delivers his role brilliantly â€“ however, as soon as he cuts his hair and puts his glasses away, he instantly turns into a bad-face thug, whom you wouldn't mess with. By changing his appearance, the illusion of the shy guy completely disappears. Main actress Nora-Jane No one is natural and beautiful. But even her care and love can't prevent the upcoming tragedy. Savage is not less that any other quality thriller nowadays. Well worth watching.
