,miggletx,2010-12-10T09:40Z,"Hi 20-40.  Sorry if these are dumb questions, but I am new to all of this.  When I try to play this through Quicktime, i get only audio, no video.  When I stream it to my PS3, I get both V and A for about 10 minutes, then the sound goes out and I get the message about ""Cinavia, Message Code 3""  What am I doing wrong?  Thanks

Matt "
