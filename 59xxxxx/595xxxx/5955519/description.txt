Hello.  This torrent contains every DOS game made by Kurt Dekker, who once ran PLBM Games, an independent development company that made made DOS and PalmOS games.  In 2007, he released his games as freeware.  Being as old and obscure as it is, who knows when the site (www.plbm.com) could go down.  Thus, to preserve these great games, I have taken the liberty of uploading them for all of you to see.  They are all DOS games, and will run on Windows XP with no problem.  If you do have a problem, use DOSBox.  If that doesn't work, too bad; Kurt no longer supports these games.  Below is the list of games.
