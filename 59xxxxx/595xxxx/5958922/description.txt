"They're Playing Her Song"

Teddy (Trevor Donovan) begins to feel more 
comfortable in his own skin and decides to 
visit a bar in West Hollywood where he soon 
realizes he forgot his wallet and is forced 
to turn to Ian (guest star Kyle Riabko) for 
help. Annie (Shenae Grimes) is ready to 
take her relationship with Charlie (guest 
star Evan Ross) to the next level but is 
mortified when his friends catch a glimpse 
of her in lingerie. Now a single father, 
Ryan (Ryan Eggold) turns to Debbie (Lori 
Loughlin) for help and the two end up 
hooking up. Navid (Michael Steger) deals 
with the fallout of having turned his 
father in for employing underage girls in 
his pornography business by turning to 
Silver (Jessica Stroup). Adrianna (Jessica 
Lowndes) is oblivious to Navid's situation 
due to her new found fame.
