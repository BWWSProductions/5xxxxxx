,fadedexile,2010-11-15T08:23Z,"probably .rar files? if so you unzip the first one and winrar will unzip the rest all into one file. not sure why people don't just use 1 file, everyone has 2 or 3 terrabytes of storage any more, don't need to save space."
[V],joshua13,2010-11-15T16:48Z,"rar won't even make any useful dent in an already compressed movie as all rips are today. I believe it's more of ""that the way we've always done it"" in some ""scene"" groups. Some argue it as a file integrity thing. If it won't unrar you know i's corrupt, but bit torrent already insures integrity a high level of confidence. corrupt files you may get were usually already corrupt in the source"
