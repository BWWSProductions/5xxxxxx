,xenomicx,2011-05-13T20:37Z,"Yes it works! About the only thing that does! Basically this audio tells you why the other diets don't work, and then gives you a list of things to do to speed up your metabolism naturally, which in turn helps you lose 30 lbs in 30 days. On day 7 now and I'm down 5.5 lbs!"

I turned him off when he spoke it - cause everybody knows that distilled water isnt good at all. yes, in lab is quite usefull, but not for supplying human body with microelements - it causing hyponatremia, hypocalcemia etc. I warn you, brothers, dont get fooled by some idiot."

 Distilled water isn't bad for you, all it is is steam condensed to make pure water. It's perfectly safe to drink and use for cooking. besides almost all our minerals come from food not water  because in order to get enough from water to make a difference, you get water poisoning. Softened water on the other hand can be bad for you if it's not filtered. Make sure what you think you know is a fact before putting it online for the world to see your ignorance."
