           Inspired by a true story set in Missouri, "The Trial of        
           Old Drum" tells the story of a valiant golden retriever,       
           Old Drum, an orphan dog that becomes a boy's best friend       
           and is then forced to stand trial for killing a                
           neighbor's sheep. Charlie Burden [Bobby Edner] is a typical    
           eleven-year old boy growing up on a farm in Western            
     Missouri. His summer days are spent helping his dad [Ron Perlman] run
     the family farm, while also finding time to go fishing at nearby     
           Miller's Lake, always accompanied by his faithful golden       
           retriever, Old Drum. Scheming with his best friend Dee         
           [Alia Shawkat] to build a       
           secret raft, Charlie nearly drowns, only to be rescued by      
           Old Drum. But Charlie's life is turned upside down when        
           his cantankerous Uncle Lon [John Schuck] accuses Old Drum      
           of killing his sheep. The town is divided over Drum's          
           guilt or innocence, and an old family wound begins to          
           fester. Losing sheep in this part of the country is not        
           taken lightly. Looking to rid the town of a sheep killing      
           menace, Lon files a lawsuit seeking to have Old Drum put       
           to death. Desperate to save Old Drum, Charlie and his          
           father try to obtain the services of one of the state's        
           best known lawyers, George Graham Vest [Scott Bakula]. At first
           hesitant, Vest is genuinely moved by Charlie's pleas to        
           save his dog and agrees to take the case. As the trial         
           progresses, the evidence mounts against Old Drum. Having       
           exhausted all legal maneuvering, Vest has one chance           
           left; his closing argument. Vest knows that this speech        
           is a matter of life and death for Old Drum. As he turns        
           to face the jury, he instills in the community and             
           forever memorializes the phrase that "A dog is a man's         
           best friend."
