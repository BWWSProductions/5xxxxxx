Jack Lemmon  &  Marcello Mastroianni


Robert Traven, a dyspeptic, edgy American businessman, arrives in Naples and is received by a friendly but officious local company representative. Exhausted by the pressures and inconveniences of a long flight, he is looking forward to rest and relaxation in his hotel room when he is visited by buoyant and upbeat Antonio Jassiello, a clerk in a bank record room, who is surprised when his old friend from the War does not recognize him. The annoyed and exhausted Traven feels he's being scammed, and the two part of bad terms. Jassiell does leave a photo of Traven and his sister taken 40 years earlier, and the time and the setting seen to stir Traven's memory, so he seeks out Antonio to apologize. Jassiello brings him back home to renew acquaintances with his family including his sister, now married and middle-aged. Not the least bit jealous, the husband is friendly and outgoing. Traven soon discovers why he has not faded from their memories as they from his. Antonio has been long forging letters from Bob, claiming all manner of heroics as he globe-trots around the world. Jassiello and his family's warmth and genuine affection for him causes Traven to prioritize the family's needs over his best interests in his company.
