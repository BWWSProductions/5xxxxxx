,Bob_Jones,2010-12-10T02:05Z,"Does anyone have the problem where sometime during the scan, my computer instantly shuts down? Is anyone actually gonna read this question? "
,Maynard46,2010-12-10T13:25Z,"I havnt had that problem Bob.  But I cant get this to run a full scan. I installed it just fine, did all the updates but it wont complete even 1 scan. It gets stuck after about an hour and just sits there. Im running XP SP3"

,avenger63,2010-12-23T01:51Z,Same here. Works for about a month. It said I had about 5 years before expiring. Now says 0. back to using last version now with the 14 day reactivation crack. Works longer anyway
,Mincercat,2010-12-23T07:09Z,"on one of my computers, it expired suddenly too. on the rest it seems to be working- reinstalling doesn't seem to work...any ideas on what to do?"
,Mincercat,2010-12-23T16:12Z,"No wait, it just expired on all of them. So my guess is that this doesn't work."
,avenger63,2010-12-24T04:17Z,"Yup, had it on several computers. All quit the same day. Don't bother downloading. It doesn't work anymore. "
,lucastosi,2010-12-28T22:02Z,"everytime i try to use it it asks me for a password..

,Mincercat,2010-12-29T06:27Z,"Doesn't matter what the password is (mine didn't ask for one). It stops working after about a week, and can't be re-registered. "
,jus01,2011-01-02T11:44Z,update this torrent no longer works the serial has been used on too many computers and is now locked.

,Mincercat,2011-02-11T06:04Z,"Yes, it will say it is registered for several years at first, but that only lasts a week or so. Then it reverts back to not being registered. I accept your apology, btw."
