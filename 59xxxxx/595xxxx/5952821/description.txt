Proactive Real-time Virus Protection â€“ \"Zero-Hour\" Protection

Zero-hour protection means that the time it takes between a new threat emerging and your PC being protected against it is zeroâ€”so you are protected BEFORE new viruses and spies emerge. Webroot Antivirus with Spy Sweeper stops not only known threats, but also potentially dangerous unknown programs by identifying suspicious behavior and blocking their access to your computer.

Minimal Impact on Computer Performance

Scanning can be initiated in the background or after hours to minimize any impact to desktop performance. You can also choose to perform whatever type of sweep you need. If you\'re looking for an immediate diagnosis, choose a quick sweep. For a pinpointed search, customize your sweep to skip files by folder or file extension. For a deep cleaning, opt for a full sweep.
