,i_am_sid,2010-11-15T16:27Z,"@prashant, DSIN
I have a query. I think you guys might answer it.
There are two video files. Both are BRrips. Both have same specifications(a/v bitrate, framerate, etc).
The only difference is the resolution. One is 1280x528(720p) and other is 720x304. Do both look same in quality and clarity or there is a noticeable difference(considering a 32"" LED or LCD tv)?"
[V],prashant22,2010-11-15T17:16Z,"@sid
there will be a difference for sure a little bt yes there will be..1280x528 will look much better..i can see it on my 21"" too...

although the bitrate must be atleast 750kbps..if suppose bit rate were 500-600kbps then the 720p will look worse all pixelated..
