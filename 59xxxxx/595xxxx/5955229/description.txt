Songs from Metalocalypse Third Season almost all ripped from HDTVRips (except songs from 3x03 Dethhealth, you know why) and modified/mastered a little to sound closer to original songs we wait for.

Okay, Pickles' Rehab Saga must be a whole one piece cuz it sounds completed this way.

Bitrate is different. All HDTVRip-songs (except I'ms a God) are 160kbps Mono. Because originally they sounded like voice in left channel and music in right channel. Sorry for that.

I'ms a God is 320 kbps Stereo.

Hamburger Time, A Bloody Mess, and Fun on a Weekend in Cayman Islands songs are in 224 kbps (original audiotrack bitrate from Dethhealth episode)

p.s. I waited for DVD to rip songs from it.. but screw this. I'll better wait for original CD.
p.p.s. I know there is rip like that somewhere. This is just my take on it.
