,MoviesR101,2010-11-15T16:19Z,"Yeah WTF! I Am Also Stuck At 91.4%??? I Have Been Downloading For Over 12 Hours! WTF The File Is Only 593MB's? In That Same Period of Time I Downloaded 2 Different Files 5 GB's Each and A File Over 10 GB's! What's Wrong With That Picture?
Where Are The Seeders?????????????????????
Greedy Bastards! Seed!!!!!!!!!! I Would Like To See This Fight Sometime This Week!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,senyorito,2010-11-15T16:35Z,"Lol!  My uploading ratio is 1.4 already.  And yet, we're all stuck at 91.4%.  My client says there are 3 seeders.  It's either that these 3 seeders are capping their upload speed.

Well, I wish that those leechers that can leech to the seeders (obviously, only few among us can connect to the seeder/s), please max out your upload speed for a time being."
,ShadowXcz,2010-11-15T16:42Z,"Stuck at 91,4% as many other here. Can the uploader seed the last 50mb please? Will be seeding for weeks if that happens."
,ShadowXcz,2010-11-15T16:43Z,"@senyorito

No seeds showing up here. :/
Come on uploader, seed the last part."
,senyorito,2010-11-15T16:54Z,^ Oh I see mate.  Then it's uTorrent's bug.
