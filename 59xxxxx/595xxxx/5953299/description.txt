With iText, one can transform PDF documents into live, interactive applications quickly and easily. This free and open source library for Java and .NET is the leading tool of its kind, and was primarily developed and maintained by Bruno Lowagie, the author of this book.
iText in Action, Second Edition offers an introduction and a practical guide to iText and the internals of PDF. While at the entry level iText is easy to learn, there's an astonishing range of things you can do once you dive below the surface. This book lowers the learning curve and, through numerous innovative and practical examples, unlocks the secrets hidden in Adobe's PDF Reference.

This totally revised new edition introduces the new functionality added to iText in recent releases, and it updates all examples from JDK 1.4 to Java 5. The examples are in Java but they can be easily adapted to.NET............
