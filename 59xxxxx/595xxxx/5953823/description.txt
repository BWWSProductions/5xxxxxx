In a musical journey that began in England in the late 1970's, composer, performer, multi-instrumentalist and radio DJ Stephen Kent has blazed a trail across five continents, living at various times in the UK, Spain, Australia and the USA. His musical scores, composed for theatre, circus and dance companies, have received international acclaim and his work as a performer and recording artist has established him as a unique talent in the global music scene. He is one of the foremost exponents of the Australian Aboriginal Didjeridu in contemporary music.
