,DiirtyHippy,2010-11-14T09:07Z,"Before anyone starts foaming at the mouth cause of AP2.5, heres something for you:

Old samsung and hitachi drives DO NOT SUPPORT AP2.5 (as in the new dashboard does nothing)

How do i know? i have an old samsung drive with ixtreme 1.51 firmware and use ppf-o-matic3 to patch my games and ive played Fable 3 on teh new Dashboard and... nothing, srsly NOTHING FUCKING HAPPENS. AT ALL

For those who are unlucky to own an old 360 model, Please for the love of fucking god WAIT FOR THE NEW LT FIRMWARE UPDATES

that is all"
,DiirtyHippy,2010-11-14T09:10Z,"Ive also played Black OPs, Vanquish, Sims 3, and Fallout vegas 

I have yet to recieve a ""Dirty Disc Error"" even after playing for hours, But i stay the fuck away from playing games while on xbl

,DiirtyHippy,2010-11-15T00:07Z,"Aibi:

From what i heard only the 2006 models and below dont have the AP2.5 compatability but, to be honest i really dont know anything else beyond that

Play it safe and wait for teh new ixtreme LT update and upgrade your drive. Patience mang patience"
