From Wiki:

Goodbye, Columbus (1959) is the title of the first book published by 
the American novelist Philip Roth, a collection of six stories.

In addition to its title novella, set in New Jersey, Goodbye, Columbus 
contains the five short stories "The Conversion of the Jews," 
"Defender of the Faith," "Epstein," "You Can't Tell a Man by the Song 
He Sings," and "Eli, the Fanatic." Each story deals with the problems 
and concerns of second and third-generation assimilated American Jews 
as they leave the ethnic ghettos of their parents and grandparents 
and go on to college, the white-collar professions, and life in the 
suburbs.

The book was a critical success for Roth, winning the 1960 National 
Book Award and earning a name for him as a talented up-and-coming young 
writer. Still, the book was not without controversy, as certain elements 
in the Jewish community took issue with Roth's less than flattering 
portrayal of some of his characters.[1] The short story Defender of the 
Faith, about a Jewish sergeant who is exploited by three shirking, 
coreligionist draftees, drew particular ire. When Roth in 1962 appeared 
on a panel alongside the distinguished black novelist Ralph Ellison to 
discuss minority representation in literature, the questions directed at 
him soon turned into denunciations.[citation needed] Many accused Roth 
of being a self-hating Jew, a label that would stick with him for much 
of his career. It is often speculated that the wildly obscene comedy of 
Portnoy's Complaint (1969) was Roth's defiant reply to his early 
Jewish critics.
