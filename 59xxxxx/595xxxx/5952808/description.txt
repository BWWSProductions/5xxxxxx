Film maker Martin Durkin explains the full extent of the financial mess we are in: an estimated Â£4.8 trillion of national debt and counting. It's so big that even if every home in the UK was sold it wouldn't raise enough cash to pay it off. 

Durkin argues that to putback on track we need to radically rethink the role of the state, stop politicians spending money in our name and introduce, among other measures, flat taxes to makeeconomy boom again. 

This polemical film presented by Martin Durkin, brings economic theory to life and makes it hit home. It includes interviews with academics, economic experts, entrepreneurs, no less than four ex-Chancellors of the Exchequer and the biggest stack of Â£50 notes you'll never see.
