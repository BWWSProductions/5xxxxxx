Did I miss something? I can't see a read-me, but there's like 10 application files.

Was i supposed to patch something first??
Please help :)"
,ashaman23,2011-03-01T03:41Z,"BTW, I was seeding at high priority until i realized its wasn't working properly.

I will continue seeding for a week if I can get this fixed- there's no point seeding a faulty torrent though.."
