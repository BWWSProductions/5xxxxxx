It's a great read, but I warn you-- to understand it you'll need to be a certain sort of insane, and if you don't meet that criteria, you will before the end of the book. Great alongside a gravity bong and a few handfuls of shrooms though for sure."
,Fopenplp,2012-02-06T22:27Z,Was this originally released as a pdf? Because I can't comprehend why anyone would want that. Thanks regardless.
,invisimif,2012-05-23T18:42Z,"this is by far one of my favorite books of all time. I started reading it when it was still just a halloween series, and eventually bought the book when it was released by some second world publisher. The story is amazingly funny and scary all at the same time. I've never been a fan of horror but you forget your scared because of the humor until you close the book for the day and think about what you just read. 

I highly recommend it to anyone it's definitely a  5 star book.

Now we just need someone to put ""This Book is Full of Spiders"" on here as well since it is about to come out and is the official second book. 

Thanks, and I hope you all download this book. The thing was free for a couple of years and still should be in my opinion. Books like this are far and few between and make people actually want to pick up a book again."
