I didn't see anybody else uploading this, so I decided to give it a shot.

This is Episode 09 of The Ultimate Fighter Season 12 in 720p.  It features two fights:


Jonathan Brookins vs Sako Chivitchian

and

Cody McKenzie vs Nam Phan


The winners move on to the semifinals.


I could not find any .NFO file for this, so my apologies to AAF for not including one.
