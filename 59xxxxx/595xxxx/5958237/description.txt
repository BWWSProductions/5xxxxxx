Synopis: Maria's husband and children give her a puzzle for her 50th birthday. She's delighted, and finds it a great discovery. Not only does the patient housewife have fun doing the puzzles, she's also really good at them. Overflowing with enthusiasm for her new-found passion, she goes back to the shop where they bought the gift for another puzzle. There her eye is caught by a notice on the message board: "Partner for puzzle tournament wanted". Maria musters her courage and, despite her family's misgivings, answers the announcement. (IMDB)
