,badeye,2011-01-23T15:41Z,"anyone has tried this with the 3.55 cfw? 
I just have a black screen whenever im running it"
,ANT_787,2011-01-25T01:43Z,great torrent. worked with kmeaw CTW and loaded it up with multiman manager. also the update works with it so no need to bypass it.
,WWEthebest,2011-01-31T18:24Z,when i start it a black screen appears and nothing more! PLZ HELP!
,arcadepcnut,2011-02-01T15:14Z,"Hello. i signed up because im sharing this file and decided to give it a go. it doesnt work for me just as others have expressed. I get a black screen with the loading origami in the lower right corner. it freezes at that point. im using the crappy psbreak v1 and the standard manager that works with this dongle. 3.41 firmware and im kinda new to the ps3. however i do have 6 other games working off my external usb fat32 harddrive but not this one. serverdayss says ""i went out of the game removed all updates from xmb game data for this game "" but im not sure what he is talking about. anyone had this problem and fixed it and care to explain what to do and educate those of us having problems?"
,mrwho,2011-02-04T20:30Z,"it's very simple guys..those that are getting a black screen, it needs a disc to play.  put one of your bluray games in there and after you choose the game in your manager, click on the disc next that says heavy rain..enjoy. :)"
,arcadepcnut,2011-02-04T22:28Z,"Lol at mrwho. thanks. but thats too simple. we have all already tried that obvious solution. i waited two days for that solution? Heres what you need to do to play this version.

Make sure you have an ftp program on your ps3. i used ps3 ftp server 1.2

Download the update files only from this torrent and install them.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5868148/Heavy_Rain_[PAL][PS3][Spanish][www.consolasatope.com]
You only need the folders 00000001 and 00000002 update 1.01 and update 1.02 from the torrent. dont download the eboot.

Once you downloaded only the updates use your ftp client on your ps3 navigate to the folder on your ps3 harddrive called /dev_hhd0/vsh/task an delete the folder 00000001 and copy the two folders 00000001 and 00000002 from the torrent you downloaded. Back up your current eboot.bin file. its in your gamez folder whether that be on a external usb or internal. go to ....gamez\BCUS-98164\usrdir and backup your eboot.bin file in there.

Reboot without enabling ps3 dongle and go to your games menu. you will see two new items. one to install update 1.01 and one to install update 1.02

Install both updates in order 1.01 first then 1.02

now reboot again this time enabling dongle.

ftp back in your box and overwrite the eboot.bin with the one you backed up. the updates put on a new eboot.bin file that wont work with the jailbreak.

Now load your game manager and play the game!"
,mrwho,2011-02-05T08:10Z,arcade..honestly.  i had same problems of the black screen.  i just popped in another bluray game was was able to launched it that way.  it asked me to update the game to 2.0 and i chose yes.  then started playing..maybe some others can try that first...gl.
,wiloh,2011-02-06T19:43Z,"any gotten it to work on kmeaw 3.55? 
if i start the game with internet it wanst me to update but then it freezes during the update, so i disconnect from the internet and the game gets stuck on a loading symbol. "
,arcadepcnut,2011-02-16T22:10Z,Yes it works on kmeaw 3.55 thats what im using. along with gaiamanager. just make sure you put it on local internal HD as it wont work on the external drive even though there are no files over 4gb
,tonnyco,2011-02-19T05:10Z," thanks mrwho, you're the man. So guys just put a bd game and it will work. I using kmeaw."

,Ml2tal,2011-03-13T12:06Z,Is this an uncensored version where there is nudity too?
,chosen3000,2011-03-14T02:25Z,"@Me127, you are screwed for the update, the only thing you can do is return it immediately and get another one, you should have 90 days to do that. "
,LG23,2011-03-16T01:33Z,Copy to INTERNAL HD and it will work!!!
,Stormeah,2011-03-27T06:11Z,This game does NOT need MOVE. It is not even compatible. Where did you even get that idea?
,chosen3000,2011-03-28T22:44Z,I copied from external to internal. Works now. 
,Zastupnik,2011-04-08T10:51Z,"please people i'm getting old dl this it is taking too long i heard the game is great, set your upload speed to max, and those of you that did a hit n run come back and reseed please. i'm downloading this for a week now and only 47% frustration is the word"

,pdfermat,2011-04-29T00:37Z,"Guys, if you want to update the game it's ok, but YOU DON'T NEED IT IN INTERNAL HD, If you're locked at black screen with the origami you just quit the game and do this: everytime you choose it in multiman don't press X, instead press SELECT+X then play the game"
,jblinman,2011-07-07T01:57Z,"Is there a way to run this with Multiman without putting in a disc? My Bluray drive is busted and won't read anything, hence the reason for jailbreaking. If anyone has had any such luck, please tell me your steps."

,6oxtynin9,2011-12-28T04:09Z,"@Stormeah - There IS a MOVE Edition, however, this is not it. The MOVE Edition is only available in European version ""BCES00797"". I have both version so I should know. 

This games works on both 3.41 & 3.55 (Kmeaw) - INTERNAL only!!!! For External use on 3.55, you MUST first install the game data from the ORIGINAL disc, then you can boot from external. The game CANNOT be booted discless, meaning YOU HAVE TO HAVE a bluray disc in the drive both 3.42 & 3.55!!!!

@jblinman, in the case that your optical drive is busted, you're shit out of luck with this game."
,6oxtynin9,2011-12-28T04:12Z,"EDIT from above - on both ""3.41"" & 3.55 Kmeaw."

,sarthak7,2012-03-21T04:34Z,"This torrent is great. Will upload till 30GB

This is how I made it work -

-Copy it into the internal HDD of PS3.

-Run it on CFW.

It'll work


Important Notes

-Will not work on external 

-There are files which may look like split files but     they are not. Just copy to internal and it'll work."

,bobdylan8,2012-03-25T09:45Z,"HEY EVERYONE ITS POSSIBLE TO PLAY DISCLESS! DON'T LISTEN TO THE NOOBS
proof: http://psx-scene dot com/forums/f187/heavy-rain-discless-fix-74895/

(AFTER GETTING THIS TORRENT INSTALL INTERNAL THROUGH FTP)

FIRST download this pkg:
http://rapidshare dot com/files/44259661...1122223333.pkg

SECOND LOAD it to your Kmeaws 3.55 firmware XMB PS3

THIRD use multimanager to make a shadow copy of the game.

FOURTH load the game through multiman and when it sends you to XMB run the PKG and your all set to run discless on a new PS3

FIFTH DONT UPDATE TO V2.00 i haven't cuz it will probably f*ck it all up

ONCE YOU GET IT WORKING PLEASE THANK ME AND ADDRESS ME AS MR.AWESOME"
