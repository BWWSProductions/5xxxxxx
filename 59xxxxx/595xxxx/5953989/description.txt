HQ very rare "Disco" tv show promo music video. "Disco" was a pop music program that aired in Germany on the ZDF network from 1971 to 1982. It generally aired on the first Saturday of each month at 7:30PM, each show running 45 minutes. 133 shows were produced. The show was hosted by German actor and comedian Ilja Richter. 

The show focussed on chart hits current at the time of airing, giving about equal airtime to international pop music and German Schlager. Despite its name, it did not particularly focus on disco music although it featured many disco hits as long as they were chart relevant. (The name of the show was devised before disco as a musical style existed). 

"Video Killed the Radio Star" is a song by thesynthpop/New Wave group The Buggles, released as their debut single on the 7 September 1979, on Island Records. It celebrates the golden days of radio, describing a singer whose career is cut short by television. The song topped the music chart in several countries and has been covered by many recording artists. It was the first music video shown on MTV in the U.S. at 00:01 on 1 August 1981. The song was number 40 on VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80's.
