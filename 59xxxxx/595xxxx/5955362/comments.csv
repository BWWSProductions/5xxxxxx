[V],big_dad_e,2010-12-24T04:31Z,Complaints ALWAYS come from those that contribute nothing except their biased opinion.  Go buy it & STFU.
,AJNorth,2011-03-05T00:49Z,"Thanks for this marvelous post - one of the all-time greats!

An ensemble cast, clever and witty writing, exceptional production value and attention to detail, wonderful photography - and Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer, this seamless blend of murder, mayhem and screwball comedy only improves with repeated viewing.

As big_dad_e pointed out, this is indeed known as ""the best Hitchcock picture that Hitchcock didn't make;"" in fact, Peter Stone and Stanley Donen have their own cameos (one way or another) in their film.  As a small boy, my father took me to Universal Studios while the picture was in post-production, and I got to wonder about some of the sets.  This film has aged well; indeed, one might even call it 'timeless.'
