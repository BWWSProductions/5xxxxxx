****************************************

28-NOV-2011 UPDATE:

Before anything, DISCONNECT internet, turn of firewall and antivirus programs... 

Because these things can cause u trouble like: error while installing ""Insert AutoCAD 2011 disc 1"" message appears, and can't continue installation...

Continue installation following instructions in 1.CRACK_toxic_el folder. Thanks to cosworthxyz for solving this.



* If this problem appears, even when internet is disconnected, firewall and antivirus are off, then extract files from AutoCAD_2011_EFSB_Win_64bit.iso instead of mounting image. Then continue installation following instructions in 1.CRACK_toxic_el folder.

Sorry for any inconvenience. Please rate, leave comment, and SEED."

I know what your problem is. if you haven't figured it out yet, 
- you have to run the key gen program
- click mem patch, (then ok or whatever)
- close autocad and re-open
- you'll have the request code, enter it, click generate to get your activation code
- before entering the activation code, click mem patch again, then enter the activation code. it'll then accept the 14 box code.

I have followed your full instructions including disconnecting the internet cable and the install was flawless. I ran the program successfully for quite some time and then closed it. After I was done, I reconnected my internet cable and everything was fine.

A day later, I tried to run AutoCAD2011 and I got a very small window that said something along the lines of ""Validating Autodesk license"" along with a progress bar. Shortly after, I got the big license window that said that I had an invalid license and I could try and repair it. I get a request code, but if I use the keygen and get a new code, it won't work.

1.Install Autodesk Autocad
2.Use as Serial 666-69696969, 667-98989898, 400-45454545 .. or anything matching this template
3.Use as Product Key 001C1
4.Finish the installation & restart Autodesk Product...

here comes trouble...

(5.Before clicking on Activate.....)

So I reastart the Autodesk , but I don't see any license screen where I can chose to activate the product, it actually offers to me to install product, which i already did. If I try to install it again it gives me an error: ""pit.config is not found!""

please somebody help me out here...
Thank you in advance"

"" There is two button appear on the error message box . One of it is ""Try again"" and other is ""Cancel"" . What is the problem. I searched at google but results are not fix my problem. Maybe problem is related to windows update.?

,XerXesNG,2011-05-09T09:01Z,"So I'm in a country where the internet connection I can afford takes about 14 days for this to completely download. And thats if there's pwer supply all night.
Hopefully, this will work perfectly on my HP Pavillion 4gb ram.
Please I'll be coming back here incase I have any issues. 
Of course after I've tried all possible stipulated methods here on the comments and in the help files.
This is my first AutoCAD download.
Took a lot of screening to choose this one.
Goodluck to me."
,pornsignori,2011-05-10T20:27Z,"So I've overcome the CD1 problem, and installation runs without any problems, until it start with the Language packs. Error 1308 occurs several times, but installation continues, until it confirms installation complete. All appears to be successful until I start the program. Instead of starting up, it starts installing again? 
Has anyone had this problem, and gotten around it? W7 64"
,aguila78,2011-05-16T20:04Z,everything is running perfect just i cant complete the registration because i have the request and the activation number wich is 8 digit short but when i click mem patch it says: Make sure you can write to current directory.   I choose to run as an administrator... any ideas???  thanks!!
,flawzz,2011-05-19T14:57Z,"Ok so this is how i solved the ''make sure you can write to current directory"" message that appears when you try to do ""mem Patch""

Basically The folder where autocad is installed to usually C:\Program Files\Autodesk needs to have the correct permissions. Go to the folder C:\Program Files\Autodesk and right click and go to properties. Then go to security and make sure that user has full control ticked in the box. After this it worked perfectly for me. This is how i did it for windows 7

Hope this helps."
,merikiito,2011-06-08T12:34Z,"For those that are having problems with the serial being short I think you will find that you are inputing O (letter) instead of 0 (Zero) or vice versa!
This will solve your problem :)"
,merikiito,2011-06-08T12:35Z,Also the shorter serial works once you use the correct characters

,jenp89,2011-08-08T23:43Z,"Thanks for the upload, toxic_elvis!

I had a few problems before I could finally get the installation to work.

If you are having problems with the key gen, make sure that you run it by RIGHT CLICKING on the key gen and clicking RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR. If you don't do this, clicking on the 'Mem Patch' button might give you a message saying you do not have permission. And even though my activation code was 8 characters short, it still worked. :)

Hope that helps!

Thanks again, toxic_elvis!"

1. disable antivirus and internet
2. I did all the steps 1 to 7 according to the file ""Instructions-64bit"" in the crack folder (generated some errors when installing the language, which omitted)
2. active after restart the internet (the antivirus, to avoid disappointment)
3. Continue the remaining steps
4 enjoy
