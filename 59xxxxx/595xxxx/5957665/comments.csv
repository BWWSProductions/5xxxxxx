install winrar from there remember to choose the correct one for your OS 32bit or 64bit, once installed open the folder where you have this torrent (or any rar'd) files saved, right click the first rar then choose extract, choose where you want the .avi saved it will then unpack it and you will be able to play it on vlc"
