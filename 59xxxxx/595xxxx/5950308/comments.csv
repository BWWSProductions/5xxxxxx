Fuzzy!  CERTAINLY NOT a True ""DVD Rip""!  Sounds great but looks very much like a CAM!"
,nehoc,2011-01-03T10:47Z,"Thanks for the effort, but colours are washed out so maybe it really does look like a cam. So I went to cinema after I saw first ten minutes of this file - and had one of most enriching cinema experiences in my life. This is to be seen in the theatre."

,LarryInColumbus,2011-03-27T06:05Z,"This movie is a series of of the uglist situations that could occur in your life.  I kept watching hoping for somethng redeeming but it just kept getting worse.

It should have a negatitive value because after watching it, you will wish that you never put that shit in your head. "
,Tizer,2011-05-03T00:36Z,"For those of you who like writing negative comments after DL try BUYING the movie, watching it and the trying to return it based on your comments.  It's supposed to be like this, if you don't like it why do you DL and then be totally unappreciative about it? What a bunch of moaning arse wipes!"
,Robin5555,2011-05-26T13:47Z,"cut version 155 min, uncut 161 min.."
,camo12345,2011-07-19T06:22Z,"I heard good reviews about this but after watching it (and nearly falling asleep several times), I have to say it is not very good. Okay, it has substance and you keep watching just to see what happens to the girl, but the camera was awful, I wanted a different view, a different perspective, it got really boring with that one view all the way through! Plus you hardly get to see the guys face. I did however like how the movie got the story across clearly despite having very little dialect. 

Worst parts of the movie for me: Flying over rooftops for 10 minutes, watching someone have sex, then flying back to see one of his friends. It got irritating after the 3rd time of doing this.

Best parts of the movie for me: The sudden flashbacks to his childhood and the car scene (it was frightening because the movie forces you to see it from the childrens eyes, pretty disturbing but powerful).

Most awkwardly intense part of the movie for me: Looking at the fetus after the abortion... It actually made me feel a little sick, it did however strengthen my belief about the subject, and I don't know how any doctor can live with those images in their head in real life, you can clearly see it is a living being.

Strangest part of the movie for me: When it shows you the penis coming at you and cumming towards you (I'm glad it wasn't in 3D!!)"
