,Exzol,2010-11-12T23:27Z,"@ fernqvist

,eziogamer,2010-11-12T23:28Z,"hey.. can any one confirm this if it has ap 2.5 check or dashboard updates on the disc?
is it working for anyone?
 will i have any problem like geeting flagged or getting banned when i go online afterwords?
thanks in advance for reply.."
,hunter212yy,2010-11-12T23:37Z,"It is AP2.5, it has the dash update (just click no when it asks to update). Guys, playing those games is a lotto."
,Fernqvist,2010-11-12T23:51Z,"@Exzol

no im not, pls download the game and say sorry after, i know im right, im a 360 uploader myself and i get info about the release before i upload torrents, im not a uploader on piratebay tho (lol...) im a uploader on pirogames, "
,Fernqvist,2010-11-12T23:56Z,"@Exzol

please download the game so you see for yourself before calling someone a retard.
"
,Fernqvist,2010-11-13T00:56Z,"finally got some good news about this release:

It will work on Hitachi 47 drives!! but its the only confirmed so far, rest of the drives can read the ap25 ""layer"" so its useless for all other drives"
,profetonan,2010-11-13T01:33Z,"@Fernqvist

Then it will probably work on Hitachi 78 and 79 drives too, like Fable III did?"
,_onoffon_,2010-11-13T01:44Z,"Its ok, u can download the new dashboard from this game. As long as it isnÂ´t a SSV3 game its cool. And its only Fable III and some hasbro game that has SSV3."
,abernick00,2010-11-13T01:54Z,"This game along with Fable III are AP 2.5 (stands for Anti Piracy 2.5) for noobs....   every game from now on most likely will have this ""extra"" security on it. if you downloaded the new dashboard, this game will NOT play. if you still have the old one, it should play fine.   I played Fable III for days, then downloaded the new dash and it says ""disc unreadable"". Also, experts believe that Microsoft is recording these attempts at playing AP 2.5 games on the new dash, to get ready for a mass ban, so if you have the new dash, DONT TRY IT...   "
,_onoffon_,2010-11-13T02:38Z,"but if u dont accept on doing the new dash the game wont start. And if u uppdate ur dash u will recieve a ban. 
Just have to wait for the new flash that will come later then."
,filipego,2010-11-13T02:45Z,I was able to play Fable 3 without a problem but for ACB I was able to install the game on the hard drive but was not able to play it
,Fernqvist,2010-11-13T02:50Z,"not gonna answer any more idiot questions here, if you want to ask me something contact me on the site im a uploader on, think it says where on some post above....."
,Gordito15,2010-11-13T03:47Z,"Yep Is not goingto work on a benq drive just install
the new ap.25 and it does not work have to wait for new flash"
,Gordito15,2010-11-13T03:49Z,I would say not to download just yet i'm not saying it's a bad torrent but we cant use it just yet
,silent69,2010-11-13T05:35Z,"C4eva have told people to not update for kinect dashboard!Games that have AP2.5 will only work on the latest dashboard an not on kinect!Now most of the games will come with AP2.5 and people that have update will not be able to play it,and will have to wait at least 2 to 3 months before LT+ comes out !Has for the new dashboard that is also included in the disc of ACB i think since the game is wave 9,maybe paching to wave 4 to 6 or making use of the DISC BOOT will probable solve the problem for people yet on the latest dashboard!Have some one try already booting ACB on the latest dashboard ( not kinect!)??If someone was able please inform the rest of us!? thanks "
,Lobyone,2010-11-13T06:19Z,has anyone downloaded and actually tested it? you guys are starting to scare me with all the new dashboard/AP 2.5 talk.  my usb/networking outlets in the back are fauked... so yea.... i play offline anyways. as if i had a choice.
,bezzlebub666,2010-11-13T07:22Z,it dont work i have nhew dash board 
,-Kira-,2010-11-13T07:30Z,"I've tested it on 9199 dashboard(NXE) and it requires dashboard update to play, but if you do the update the new dash will block the game cause it has AP25 so either way the game wont start. The only think we can do now is wait till someone comes up with something that can help."

,eziogamer,2010-11-13T09:05Z,"what about if we can patch it to ssv2 using abgx 1.0.3 and we will also need the patch files i guess.
i've seen some ssv2 patch files biengposted here on piratebay for some old games..!!
can someone throw some light on this?"
,abernick00,2010-11-13T10:02Z,"Patching it to SSV2 would not make a differnence....  this is a whole ""extra level of security""... there is no way around it right now. It should work if you had the old dash, as I played Fable III for a week with no problem, until the new dash update, now ""disc is unreadable"" because the new dash is telling the drive to check for this ""Anti-Piracy 2.5 (AP25)"" that the flashed firmware knows nothing about. i hope they make a quick fix to the firmware for this or a TON of ppl are gonna get banned as it records every ""disc is unreadable"" via AP2.5 and when you plug into xbox live, all info is sent to MS. they are probably preparing for a new mass banning.    Hello PS3! here i come!   final fantasy 14 and DC universe should keep me busy for a few years......"
,profetonan,2010-11-13T13:52Z,"There are rumors on different boards that the game works with some Samsung and Hitachi DVD-drives, even with the new dash innstalled. Can somone confirm?"
,lookwhoshere_wow,2010-11-13T14:41Z,I have the old dashboard... I have not connected the xbox to the net for over a year now... Will this game work on the old dashboard?
,Lobyone,2010-11-13T15:46Z,same here. i dont give a damn about being banned... i cant go on XBL. but it sounds like it wont work

,N3rdUndead,2010-11-14T01:24Z,"Dudes i don't get it. If i press ""Yes, Update now."" I'm not gonna be able to play any games or only ACB? And how to find out if i have a Hitachi or Samsung or whatever?"
,Lobyone,2010-11-14T02:52Z,"http://llamma.com/xbox360/Xbox_360_DVD_Drive_Comparison.htm
to see what drive you have on your xbox. "
,LNC123,2010-11-14T04:43Z,there is a way to get past the whole disk unreadable deal. just install the game on your HD clear your cache go play game wait for black screen count to three and press the eject button twice really quickly so the drive doesnt actually open and it will ask you to update and play but everytime you want to play you have to clear the cache and do the quick eject trick but it works for my fable THANK GOODNESS!
,lookwhoshere_wow,2010-11-14T04:58Z,"@ sylar 12
buddy... Thank you for the reply... four hours left for the download... I shall try and let you know if it works for me... "
,Lobyone,2010-11-14T05:31Z,i updated the dashboard. it works perfectly. i have an old samsung drive
,Adarmbig,2010-11-14T10:40Z,"@LNC123 
Does it really work? Because i tried it and it dowsnt work for me...:( How should i do i exactly? 
1)Install on HDD
2)Play the game
3)Black screen comes up immediately
4)Press the eject button twice, quickly on the xbox itself
5)The game should play?
Thanks!"
,N3rdUndead,2010-11-14T13:11Z,"@Adarmbig

Clear the cache he said also. I don't know is this right but i googled it and this is what came up http://vgstrategies.about.com/od/xbox360faqs/a/ClearX360Cache.htm"
,karim_hesham22,2010-11-14T13:19Z,disc unreadable ????? i did what lnc123 said and also didnt work   i have the new dashboared    so must i do ???????????????????????????
,N3rdUndead,2010-11-14T13:23Z,Noone answered me. If i update i'm not gonna be able to play any pirated games at ALL?
,David891,2010-11-14T14:08Z,"@N3rdUndead
Old games will still work. Only wave 9 games won't. We'll have to wait for new iX version for it to work I think."
,lookwhoshere_wow,2010-11-14T15:48Z,"No dude, after i put the cd in , it's COMPULSORY to update before playin... So even on old dash no use... And after i updated its sayin disc unreadable.

GOOD NEWS is that LT plus will be out before dec 1st :) "
,N3rdUndead,2010-11-14T17:21Z,Ummm this is kind of a mindfuck because people say both Fable III and ACB won't work but Fable III works for me even WITH the new update.
,Adarmbig,2010-11-14T17:55Z,"@N3rdUndead
Well i guess you installed only the beta version of the dashboard, where theres no avatar, ami i right? If you installed the one on the ac disk. Because if you install the full package(through xboxlive or with a usb stick etc.) you wont be able to play fable 3 nor ac."
,TheCarpenter,2010-11-14T19:54Z,"@lookwhoshere_wow or anyone else:
Did you try to change the wave to Wave2 or 3 by replacing the files that contain the new dashboard? There are some utilities that do it. "
,874hack4,2010-11-14T20:19Z,"Here's how you do it..Must have Hitachi drive, have ixtreme1.51 which is the newest firmware you can put on the drive, burn the game throw it in, wants you to install new kinect dashboard do it, then wait til its finished and you have a working copy of acb. the hitachi doesn't check the ap2.5 because its so old so youre good to go im playin right now. WARNING: if you dont have the hitachi drive installing the kinect dashboard will cause acb to not work along with possibly other games so beware, i hear the samsung drive is also capable of this, everyone else sorry you gotta wait til they get lt+ out hopefully soon!"
,N3rdUndead,2010-11-14T22:25Z,"@ Adarmbig

No mate my Dashboard has everything including the avatar. My old one didn't so i was eager to update this one."
,N3rdUndead,2010-11-14T22:27Z,Yeah one thing. I mounted the .iso file after extracting it on PowerIso and opened it. It had a %SystemUpdate folder in it. Can't i just delete the AP25 file in there?
,nomanhyderarain,2010-11-15T03:55Z,"When I start game I get not readable. 2nd time I try its boot and go to main menu. 
And after that many times I try but I get same error. I have modded Xbox (hacked)
I update from Xbox live (not banned yet). Now I have kincet dashboard.

,avengerz43,2010-11-15T05:07Z,I have a Hitachi 79 with ixtreme 1.51. I keep this 360 offline ever since the COD MW2 ban wave last Christmas. I updated to newest dashboard update thru USB method. Fable 3 and this AC BH works fine on my 360 so I dunno if it's just Hitachi's or what also heard some Samsung's work as well. 
,Fan1,2010-11-15T08:05Z,"Hi! So, from what i understand from the comments, the game tells you to update to the new dashboard and once updated it wont read the disc anymore? Even if you have the Samsung drive? Did u guys also have problems with Fable 3 and COD BO?"
,Dez_Nutz,2010-11-16T10:19Z,thats why you never go on xbox live with back up copies come on ppl this is not new.

I have not touched it. Maybe it just needs a restart, idk."
