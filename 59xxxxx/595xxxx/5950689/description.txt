*This is a compilation that I assembled. 

Inner Circle is, of course, best known for "Bad Boys," a ubiquitous 
crossover hit thanks to its use as the theme song for the long-
running Fox TV reality series Cops. But the band had a lengthy 
history prior to its international breakthrough, dating all the way 
back to the late '60s. They hit the big time in Jamaica during the 
'70s as a danceable yet rootsy Rastafarian reggae outfit, fronted by 
the charismatic singer Jacob Miller. Miller's tragic death in a car 
accident in 1980 put the group on hiatus for several years, and when 
they finally regrouped in the mid-'80s, they began to temper their 
rootsiness with elements of pop, R&B, and dancehall.
