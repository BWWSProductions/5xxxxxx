Did you get to watch the Australia vs. Munster match.  Word has it that it was a hilariously painful loss."
[T],shemyaza,2010-11-19T00:48Z,"Yup, it's never good losing to a provincial side but keep in mind that it was an Aussie B team."
,consumus,2010-11-20T19:28Z,"@shemyaza
I'm still confident that Aus will find consistency by the time the world cup comes around.  They have to!

Btw.  Do you have any plans to upload the Samoa vs. England match?"
,wburt,2010-11-23T00:30Z,"Thanks very much for the upload.  Well worth watching, for the ridiculously biased commentary team if nothing else ."
