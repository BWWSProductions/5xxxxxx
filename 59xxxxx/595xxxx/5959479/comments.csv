,Sparkess,2010-11-20T10:54Z,Kinda skeptical to download this considering your other ones were 20gigs a pop almost but I will check it out. It better be 720p and not just ripped in 720p and then compressed to some shitty youtube quality.
,ytero,2010-11-24T21:06Z,sound quality seems to be totally trashed. like you can't make out the words most of the time =/
[V],Konashine,2010-11-25T13:45Z," all of the MKV FILES are IMMERSE or CTU release group's things.
i cant found sound error(s)
maybe you have your media player problem.

,Stunny99,2011-11-01T17:32Z,"The video quality is good. However, there is no sound, it only plays subtitles. Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong? I downloaded Divx player to play it and it says it can't play audio.

Please help."
