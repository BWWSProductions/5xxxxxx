but 831meg wont fit CD. Nero would not
burn to DVD because it is CD format."
,gboggs,2012-01-31T03:08Z,try mounting the iso on a virtual drive like daemon tools or virtual clone drive. it worked for me. mount the image then run min4win.exe and install. it installs in windows no need to make it into a partition
