,gs242656,2010-11-14T06:34Z,Thanks
,CodeZero23,2010-11-14T06:49Z,Are you going to do a ATV version?
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-14T16:45Z,Possibly.  Wanted to share them since I bothered to fetch them and thought a bundle torrent would be ok for now of the originals.
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-14T18:56Z,"Someone should watch these and tell me if they are good, preferably an english reader and tell me if the subs are good too."
,johnnyapplec,2010-11-14T22:21Z,thanks for sharing 1080p stuff!
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-14T23:10Z,"mmm, destroying the good old bandwidth this weekend."
,bozo1990,2010-11-25T11:55Z,could you please do the ipod version of this.. 
,foxz,2011-01-15T05:36Z,are the subs hardcoded?
,g0nadzintherain,2011-01-19T10:40Z,Thanks but are these the extended versions?
,siru,2011-01-24T20:30Z,"I saw one of 3 films and is excellent, even if some scenes are extremelly violent.
The book is more complex than the film."
,VicVega,2011-07-07T17:19Z,This is not the extended TV versions. Someone should rip it from Bluray. There are HDTVrips out there but they don't look that much better than the DVDrip. The best torrent for the extended version is this one: https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6084726/The_Millennium_Trilogy_SWEDISH_EXTENDED_CUT_x264_TheCaptain_#filelistContainer
,majalogan,2011-12-27T22:04Z,"Could some-one please do a proper release of these EXCELLENT Stieg Larsson Millennium Trilogy movies ?

Thank you very much to all the people that have put them out so far, but there is no high quality proper release out yet, believe me, I've trawled through them all. What we need is:

- extended versions (movies approx 3 hours rather than approx 2h30m)

- bluray 720p or, even better 1080p (not DVD rip!)

- original Swedish language, *with optional English subs*


The boxset has been out for months so I'm surprised no-one has released them yet from the US Blurays.

If anyone knows where to find these, please let me know! Thank you very much!

,fillinthisspace,2012-01-02T04:49Z,"majalogan, I see you found Amazon. Now you've just got to give the credit card some well needed exercise. I'll look forward to your uploaded encodes. :-)"

,evazap99,2012-01-17T11:01Z,"@HolyRoses yes, thanks, but those are not the extended versions either ... I just don't understand how it can be so difficult to find a proper release of such a high profile super quality film series...."
,eshimul,2012-01-31T02:28Z,"@majalogan, @evazap99 u guys can check this out. I think it's a real deal:)
