ITV Take That Look Back Don't Stare HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup 2010


To mark one of the most eagerly anticipated reunions in the history ofmusic, this programme follows the making of Take That's latest album. The band's first period of success in the 1990s was phenomenal but unsustainable. Now, 20 years after it all began, Gary Barlow, Howard Donald, Jason Orange, Mark Owen and Robbie Williams turn to face that past and share their truth collectively. With unrestricted and privileged access to the recording studio throughout the last 12 months, the programme is a raw, intimate meditation on the process of friendship and forgiveness.

The programme is filmed in black and white cinema style 2.35 aspect ratio format.
