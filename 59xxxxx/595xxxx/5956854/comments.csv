,klyd971,2010-11-15T11:42Z,"Hi, 
everything works fine.
Except that I see my airplane but it does not fellow it in GPS mode.
I get the old version and in that case, it was due to FSUIPC.
So Anything like that elsewhere.
Tks"

,janico,2010-11-16T21:45Z,not working with fs2004 :(
,janico,2010-11-17T04:58Z,"I've found the trick if your FC9 cannot work in FS2004.
Go to fsc.ini at your install directory, at the very bottom change :

[FS]
FSX=-1

to

[FS]
FSX=0"
