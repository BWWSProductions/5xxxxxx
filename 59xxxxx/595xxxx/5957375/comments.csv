,DDRobert,2010-11-17T22:01Z,"why is it so big, compared to the English PAL version which is only 13.57GB?"
,snelson0721,2010-11-19T12:18Z,"I have tried everything to play this game.  I put it a usb hd, I formatted the drive in FAT32, I created a GAMES folder, and it does the recognize the files.  PLease, can anyone tell me what I'm doping wrong?"
,dark-ways10,2010-11-20T04:05Z,"1 Create a folder in the root called (GAMEZ) not Games  

2  insert the files of the game in the Gamez folder

                                                   require ps3 jailbreak to work "
,Vivazhun,2010-11-21T08:29Z,Any idea to get PS3 Jailbrake for free by myself. So anyway to create my own?
,Diallo01,2010-11-22T02:51Z,"The game can be played in French ?
Because I see it a larger file, so then there are still different languages ?
How do you put the game in your PS3 HD if you've downloaded it on your PC or do I need a 
separate USb higher than the game,  is it possible to put the game in the ps3break and then transfer it into the HD of my ps3.Because I have the ps3 jailbreak and never used it right now"
,broagervej,2010-12-21T13:13Z,thank you for a great upload

,Boot4se,2011-01-22T17:55Z,"This is a 3.41 patch. I want a 3.5x retail. I just upgraded to Kmeaw CFW 3.55. With the 3.5x cfw, there's no need for patches. It's actually patched EBOOTS that give me the 800... error."
,sheri103,2011-01-22T18:33Z,^^ Exactly! That is not what I came searching here for... apparently they cant upload a fresh/unchanged rip of the game?? I need that file for Kmeaw's cfw...
,sheri103,2011-01-22T18:42Z,"Mate, if you are here, I got a brilliant idea.... Dunno if it'll work... Go to kickasstorrents and choose to download only the EBoot.Bin, T5.self and t5mp.self files in the game/USRDIR folder....the rest in there is italian... so get this or any other patched and overwrite it."
,sheri103,2011-01-23T08:39Z,"Sorry for the triple post, but, IT WORKED! I can now play Black ops on PSN with 3.55 Kmeaw CFW!"
,eddimurpi,2011-01-25T14:17Z,"can someone/uploader make a torrent of the eboot? original..(3.55) tht dude's theory above me, diden't work xd"
,eMKay414,2011-02-12T07:25Z,"For all those on custom firmware 3.55 (kmeaw), this *might* work.....
Download the torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6129814 its only 170MB, and overwrite the 3 files as described in the readme.

Busy downloading this 18GIG torrent......will post results once complete. If anyone else can confirm if the above patch works for 3.55, let us know....."

,KKIIAANN,2011-07-20T18:42Z,ooi will this work on 3.66 ???? ;)
,walkersdelight,2011-09-15T14:16Z,This didn't worked when i tried it first and got an 0008000 error reading. Thought it wasn't compatible with my jailbroken ps3 firmware 3.5 until I read  eMKay414's  suggestion to download this  torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6129814.  It contains 3 files which you will replace from the USRDIR folder. It worked with no hassle.  Thanks for the help and download.
