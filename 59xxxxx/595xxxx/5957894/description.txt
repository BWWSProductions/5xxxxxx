Iconic performer and vocal powerhouse P!nk's Greatest Hitsâ€¦ So Far!!!  is a collection of her hit songs along with two new tracks, including the lead single â€œRaise Your Glassâ€ produced by long-time collaborator Max Martin and co-written by P!nk.
Since her debut in 2000, P!nk (Alecia Moore) has successfully paved her way on her own terms as a talented singer/songwriter/performer. She raised the bar with her astonishing acrobatic Grammy 2010 performance of her sleeper hit â€œGlitter In The Airâ€ and over the past two years, P!nk has extensively performed sold-out performances throughout the UK, rest of Europe, Australia and the U.S, winning over critics and fans. Her previous album catalogue includes Canâ€™t Take Me Home (2000), M!ssundaztood (2001), Try This (2003), Iâ€™m Not Dead (2006) and Funhouse (2008).
