Storyline

Little coastal town is being terrorized by deadly Barracudas.

REVIEW:

Some hippies team up with a sympathetic sheriff and his bleeding heart daughter to investigate an evil (aren't they all in these movies?) chemical plant who's adversely affecting the native barracudas in this lame "Jaws" clone. The ferocious fish themselves take a surprising backseat plot-wise, the real focus of the movie is some claptrap about a government conspiracy. As that plot is pretty inane, the whole film suffers for it and becomes tediously boring because of it. Co-written and directed by Wayne Crawford, who'd have a later hit with "Valley Girl" and the equally ridiculous but more fun (in it's own campy way)"Snake Island". You would do better to give either of those two a rent and skip this one.

My Grade: C

Dark Sky DVD Extras: Vintage ads for various drive-in food; and Trailers for "Bonnie's Kids" (features nudity), "the Centerfold Girls", "Part-time Wife" (features nudity), "Psychic Killer", & "Eaten Alive". The DVD also comes with 1983's "Please don't eat the babies" (AKA: Island Fury)

(By the way - I, the uploader, diasgree with this review, I give the movie a 'B', I liked it!)
