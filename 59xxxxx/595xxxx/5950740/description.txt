[Spraff]

Following his top-selling debut DVD release in 2009 and 
sensational performances on Live At The Apollo, and Michael 
McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow, multi-award winning comedian 
Rhod Gilbert is back! 

Here, Rhod brings us his unique brand of observational 
comedy focussing on life's minor exasperations. Stung by 
accusations that he over-reacts, Rhod sets out on an emotional 
rollercoaster of a journey to discover the truth. Is he, as he 
believes, a visionary in a sea of closed minds, or has he, as 
everyone else believes, got anger-management problems?
