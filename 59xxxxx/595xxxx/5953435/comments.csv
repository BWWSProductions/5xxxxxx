,Smooshieus,2010-11-13T05:18Z,"Beautiful game and perfect torrent! Thanks!

The game itself does tend to crash occasionally, but that's also the case for the demo, so no fault of ALiAS'. If they patch it, I'll certainly support this with a purchase when it goes on sale on Steam."

Either kill this POS torrent or fix it please."

,moons_tra,2010-11-28T13:19Z,"Solution for crash during load screen found on steam support forum. It works for me! :

Actually, the setting that needs to be changed is in fact called ""Format"" under the Regional Settings icon of the control panel.

Try changing this setting to English (Canada) for example and see if that resolves your issue."
,r3d_1,2010-12-13T23:29Z,for those ppl who are having problems with crashing when it starts; just change your region to US or Canada! It still crashes ingame randomly sometimes... cool game tho
