I downloaded v4 and then three more updates were added in quick succession. I only have limited bandwidth so don't want to waste time downloading multiple copies."
,violin7,2010-11-16T14:47Z,"@guyverZX81
Final Fantasy VII is very unstable to modify and unexpected bugs, sometimes unrelated to a particular change, happen easily, so to be 100% sure that there are no problems a complete playthrough would be necessary after each change, which is too time consuming. Hopefully though, all bugs and imbalances have now been ironed out now and there wont be any need for another version."
,guyverZX81,2010-11-17T05:41Z,"That's excellent news violin7 (or possibly GalenMyra?), I am grateful for you're quick response. Please continue to update if it is necessary to ensure stablility and I'm sorry for the bitching about my bandwidth. This project deserves more support so I'll try and spread the word a little more around the nets. Thankyou for improving my gaming experience, I will download and seed this version for as long as possible."
,violin7,2010-11-17T10:43Z,"Thank you for your support, feedback is much appreciated, so if you find any problems with this version, please report."
,adamnmiller,2010-12-18T17:38Z,"Feedback:

Wutai shake boss is broken for yuffie's sidequest.
Godo appears in the temple of the ancients.

Seems like bosses or even general enemy encounters might have a bad offset somewhere. I'm not using savestates.

Email me if you need more info. Adamn_miller@hotmail.com"

Thanks for feedback, I've just noticed the problem myself and I'm looking into it..."

Hi. Thanks for the upload. 

I have a little question. Will I be able to use my saves with the next version?"
,givemeitems,2011-01-27T20:34Z,"Some bugs I've run into so far
1. Trying to fight the second boss (Shake) in Yuffie's Pagoda quest freezes the game.
2. Godo (last boss in Yuffie's quest) appears as a random encounter in the Temple of Ancients!
3. Demons Gate appeared in an area of the Temple Of Ancients with the Nail Bat.
4. In place of where the Demon's Gate and Red Dragon bosses should be were just regular enemies.
5. Jenova LIFE boss replaced by a random group of enemies.
6. Twinhead boss in Gaea's Cliff replaced by random enemies.

Basically the whole thing got screwy toward the end of disc 1.

Really a shame too because I was enjoying this mod so much =("
,PlayingCards,2011-03-19T19:34Z,"Also Jenova - Life appears as a random encounter in certain areas of the Great Glacier, instead of fighting Snow for the Alexander materia two wolves appear, Jenova - Death is replaced by a random encounter monster, not sure if this was intentional but the first four corel train fights have been replaced by serpents from the crashed gelinka and the fifth fight is Rude and Reno from the same area"
