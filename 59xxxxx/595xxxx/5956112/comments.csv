Do you know how I could save on disk the ''Digital Photoshop Retouching Beauty and Hair Retouching High end ''?
I have already made a test with ImgBurn and a dual layer disk without good results.
Its 4.59GB so unless I could  remove a few files I must use dual layer disks.
Thank you again."

,ioannisarc,2010-11-14T22:46Z,"Hi Malestrom. Willing to help as always.
I dont know if  I have understand the question.
You mean in ImgBurn? because in the specific torrent there are no files with iso, img ecc.
So if you ask regarding ImgBurn I click on menu ''Mode'' and then from undermenu I click on ''Build''. Then from menu ''File'' I click on ''Brouse for a source folder''.
I search for the torrents folder and press OK.
On the window of the ImgBurn everything is OK except for ''(((((W 23:31:56 Skipped System File: D:\PHOTOSHOP - PHOTOGRAPHY -FAI DA TE-  GUNS\Digital Photoshop Retouching B. & Hair Retouching High & Techniques\Videos\System\Thumbs.db))))).
I ha pressed ok for burning the dual DVD and it was seemed OK but during the test after the burning it presented the message that something was not ok and I must finish the work.
OK MALESTROM. I realize that I ask too much.
You provide me with many usefull books. You are not forced to help also with the rest.
However if you can advise me about another, better  burning program or you can understand the problem I thank you once more for your precious help."
