Three bootres.dll for changing windows 7 boot animation. just copy/paste the files bootres.dll and winload.dll to x:\windows\system32 where x: is your system drive letter (most probably C: )

I didnt make the animations. So credits goes to whoever made them. I just used the frames. Credits also to whoever made the win7bootupdater tool.
