Sorry, too many bad results: 30 /43 (69.8%)"
[V],Anacondaz,2010-11-14T02:43Z,they are false positives bcoz keygens are always shown as some virus
[V],MAFIAA.,2010-11-14T17:10Z,For trolls all above ^ patches / keygens / cracks are false/positive. Now GTFO!
,Idealas,2010-11-16T05:28Z,"it does it's work, symantec antivirusus didn't found anything. patched already expired free version though, which gives me ""Sandboxie is registered and licence is activated"", but that startup window with seconds is still there. so just make new installation.
Thanks uploader!"
,V12HCMF,2010-11-22T17:23Z,"Haha you guys are dumb as rocks if you run this w/o first... SANDBOXING the prog itself! No need to worry if it's BOXED in.

And to anyone claiming ""false positive, just run it,"" geesh you're just as stupid as rocks also. WTF should anyone trust you/anyone else on the net. Exactly how trojan's are spread, blind ""trust,"" aka stupidity. All of you GTFO for not thinking.

Sandbox prog + KG = [Sandboxed KG!]"
,hariklia,2010-11-23T23:30Z,"Clean and smooth, works perfect. Thank you Stun :-)"
,Int_Auto,2010-12-01T14:11Z,"The patch doesn't seem to be working for me, it says file-size mismatch. I'm running 7 x64"
,Erik_O,2010-12-01T22:03Z,patch don't work on x64 unfortunately.
,dsrs,2011-01-05T17:24Z,"never mind the false positive, the patch simply does not work
tried several times on windows 7 32 bit
always says patch OK, and app says registered and valid
BUT a day later a box comes up saying needs license file and expired in 1612!!!
looks like it is phoning home and getting deactivated
still works, but in free mode"
,eXoflow,2011-01-11T12:41Z,Patch doesn't work on 64-bit W7 :( No seed sorry
[V],matimike,2011-03-10T06:37Z,thanks Stun works perfectly
