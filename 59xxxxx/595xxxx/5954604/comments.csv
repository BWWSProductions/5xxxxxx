NO, DON'T use crappy, horrible, evil, stupid, fucked up, shitty MKV.

MKV sucks ass but not in a good way. 

MKV's are like the giftcards of the codec world; they take a video viewable by any player and make it usable by only a few. If you use MKV's you are stupid and dumb and not smart and an idiot. You're double plus retarded."
