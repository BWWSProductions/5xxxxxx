[T],IndianChristian,2010-11-12T19:13Z,"For anyone who wants a clear understanding of how Catholic theology differs from the Bible, this is a helpful tool. 

When the Second Vatican Council closed in 1965, Catholics were optimistic that the church had been renewed and blessing would follow. Little did anyone realize what lay ahead. The decades since Vatican II have been turbulent. Attendance at Mass has plummeted. Finances are critical. Vocations have steadily declined. Internal disputes and scandal are shaking the Church. What is the cause of the present crisis?
Catholicism: Crisis of Faith goes to the heart of the question by investigating the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church from a biblical perspective. Follow the journey of former Catholic clergy and laity who courageously faced a crisis of faith and emerged with a life changing experience of Jesus Christ.
