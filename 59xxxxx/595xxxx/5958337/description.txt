So inevitable was the return of Robbie Williams to Take That that the news, when it finally came, was something of an anticlimax. With his solo career stalling just as the boyband he'd left for dead a decade earlier reclaimed their place asbiggest pop act, it didn't take a cynic to predict where the reversal of fortunes would lead.

The issue was never would Robbie return, but what they would do with him when he did. Was there really room in the cosily reformed group for a dysfunctional egomaniac? Could he ever play nicely as part of a band again? It may be a reunion, but the story of Take That's third post-comeback album, their first as a five piece since 1995, is, inevitably, all about Robbie Williams.
