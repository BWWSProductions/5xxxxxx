But now, thanks to you, I can own the Criterion edition, which, as a disabled person, I could never afford.  I am absolutely knocked out by the quality of the film audio/visual, but the second disc extras are just the best I have experienced on any DVD.  Wow.  I am simply bowled over.  For any serious fan of this transcendent film, download here and burn the files onto two double-sided DVDs (that is, 8.5 GB discs, which cost â‚¬1,99 where I am).  My only complaint - and it is it a tiny one - is that there are no covers, inlays, booklets, etc.  But don't let that stop you: download now, and please reseed (as I did )!"
