Yes People, now AVG's New Update Blocks this from working and claims that its a virus.
But to all you people saying these files are infected or viruses, NO THERE NOT!
Its just avg making you have to pay for there shit.

If you don't have avg anti-virus then you don't have to worry. It should work!"
