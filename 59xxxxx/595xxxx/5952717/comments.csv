,kokobombon,2010-11-12T19:20Z,Hope someone can help me... I watch movies on a dvd player as .avi but lately it doesn´t recognize the subtitles that come with the torrent... should I save them in a different unicode? 
,_BlueDragon_,2010-11-12T20:29Z,"nº 1 team FXG!
ty very much guys :]"
,ahmedawy,2010-11-12T21:40Z,Thank Yoy FXG
,bragazar1710,2010-11-12T21:43Z,thanks.
,finski91,2010-11-12T22:23Z,what a coincidence. I was looking for this movie today. It seems first dvdrip was uploaded today.. pretty lucky i quess. I did not have to wait for this :P Anyway ill still have to wait for subtitles... so damn :D
,coolnessp,2010-11-12T23:30Z,"@koko..no, its something to do with fxg subs..even i go through the same problem..It works on the comp but not on the player. go to opensubtitles.com or subscene.com to find the subs. the working sub should be roughly under 100kb under same fxg title. those usually work. hope this helps."
,yelloo,2010-11-12T23:49Z,Thanks FXG_team.
,kokobombon,2010-11-13T00:26Z,"@coolnessp: thanks for the tip :)
btw thanks a lot FXG, my go-to guys for great quality movies!! any chance you could rip Love & Distrust...?"
,SantoshKumarM,2010-11-13T03:04Z,What is ur name in twitter..?
,coolnessp,2010-11-13T03:07Z,"@koko, if you dont find it under FXG name, just click into the info of the avi file which will show frame rate. In opensubtitles you can dl subs with the same frame rate (even though it may not be titled under FXG{Since a lot of uploaders rip @ the same frame rate} Dl tat & even those subs should work)"
,SantoshKumarM,2010-11-13T03:19Z,its ok..got it.. FXGTeam
,syedms25,2010-11-13T07:58Z,In order for the subtitles to be recognized I hope you know that the file name for the AVI and SRT files need to be the same.
,sparksv,2010-11-13T15:10Z,Thanks FXG team and thanks for Eng subtitles
,feralmum,2010-11-13T22:45Z,"Thanks so much FXG Team.  I have been waiting for this and it did not disappoint.  I loved it, and had a good laugh as well.  And an excellent rip. 10/10 from me, but I don't need subtitles.  So cannot comment for those needing them.  Keep up the good work, and I hope we can count on you for lots more prior to Christmas."
,giacaman,2010-11-14T02:10Z,seed guys
,muhu88,2010-11-14T13:37Z,"Thanks FXG

I've a request to piratebay.org
It should be returned to the previous(last) page after log in."
,ahmedawy,2010-11-14T17:19Z,Why don't you use H.264 instead of XviD
,RS2309,2010-11-14T22:15Z,"Very good family film better than I thought it would be A10/V10 Thanks FXG gr8 work as always. Hope the sequel will be as good.
(@ahmedawy 
""Why don't you use H.264 instead of XviD"")
I hope FXG never do that - I hope FXG continue with Xvid and avi as i can put it straight onto a memory stick and watch it on my TV. It doesn't read H264/MP4. "
,Dramat,2010-11-15T17:39Z,"Thanks 4 upload FXG (!) 
Legendary Team hits again ;D"
,chaosiv,2010-11-17T06:51Z,"for the subtitle to be recognized the video and subtitle should have the same name for example

video   =The Sorcerer's Apprentice[2010]DvDrip[Eng]-FXG 2.avi

subtitle = The Sorcerer's Apprentice[2010]DvDrip[Eng]-FXG.srt"
,chaosiv,2010-11-17T06:53Z,"theres no edit button so this is the right one

video   =The Sorcerer's Apprentice[2010]DvDrip[Eng]-FXG.avi

subtitle =The Sorcerer's Apprentice[2010]DvDrip[Eng]-FXG.srt"
,kokobombon,2010-11-18T00:03Z,@chaosiv: I know that the name has to be the same but the subtitle that comes with the torrent doesn´t work in my DVD player.
