PLOT:


Rusty Dennis is the mother of Rocky, a seriously deformed but extremely intelligent and emotionally warm child. Rusty is a no-nonsense mother whose wild lifestyle is often at odds with her tenderness and protectiveness towards Rocky. She is determined that Rocky be given the same chances and happiness that everyone else takes for granted.

Acclaimed filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich directed this heartwarming and inspirational film based on the real life story of Rocky Dennis (Eric Stoltz), a terribly disfigured but highly sensitive and intelligent teenager. Motivated by his loving mother, Rusty (Cher), and her boyfriend, Gar (Sam Elliott), Rocky ultimately overcomes pain, loneliness and prejudice to become a role model to his classmates and teachers alike. 

TAGLINE:


Sometimes the most unlikely people become heroes. They told 16-year-old Rocky Dennis he could never be like everyone else. So he was determined to be better.
