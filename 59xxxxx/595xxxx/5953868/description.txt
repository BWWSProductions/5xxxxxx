 Two friends embark on a quest for a lost buddy.
 On this journey they encounter a long forgotten
 bet, a wedding they must crash and a funeral   
 that goes impossibly out of control.           
 As they make their way through the perilous    
 landscape, another journey begins: their       
 inner journey through memory lane and the story
 of their friendâ€“the irrepressible free- thinker
 Rancho, who in his unique way, touches and     
 changes their lives.
