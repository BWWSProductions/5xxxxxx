[T],pastafari,2010-11-17T01:36Z,"You did nothing wrong except seeding this awesome masterpiece too much for a lot of fucking ungrateful leechers on this place ;) It seems deleting the tracker announce from the torrent is in fashion these days. That means statistics are not accurate anymore since seeders/leechers are not reported back to tracker. I've seen torrents with thousands of peers and 0/0 stats. No need to worry.

Btw, an amazing album, although I already had it ;)"
