,gabriel1475,2010-11-13T00:06Z,"I havent watched it yet, but on the VODO page with the info, there are spelling and typographical errors everywhere! WTF? They dont have one English-speaker to proofread the most important page created for their film? Says a lot. 

If the same attention to detail went into their film, I think it's going to be a difficult film to watch all the way through. But, I'll keep an open mind. Stay tuned for a review."

Ok, watching now!


First 15 seconds, not bad. The beginning of the opening titles look well executed  (a bit heavy with the added scratches and dust though, is that really needed? ""Digital"" people sure seem to bow down to film at every opportunity, yet all the while exclaiming how much better digital is. O rly?). But thatâ€™s a whole conversation. Lets focus on this film, and debate digital and film later. 

It looks interesting so far. Back in a few...

(I'll leave a comment every 15 min or so, for a play by play of how it looks. Support independent films people!!!)"
,flatusgass,2010-11-13T09:10Z,"4 minutes in. Already, dreadful acting is showing itself, and taking center stage. Sure didnt take long. And the visuals? What's with that? Every scene still looks like the title sequence, with layers of ""stuff"" on top of the action. Enough with the fake film scratches, you over-zealous digital-boys, itâ€™s really annoying, and itâ€™s fooling no one. Terms like misdirected over-stylization come to mind. Compensating, perhaps, for the bad acting, writing, really bad audio (sounds like on-camera mic in many scenes), digital-video, comically unbelievable green screen work, amateurish editing, and HORRIBLE camera work perhaps? At the 4 minute mark, it smells like a student film with way too much time spent tweaking things (badly) in After Effects. I see this a lot with micro-budget films. Itâ€™s as if they are all too well aware of how ""low-rent"" shooting video/digital appears, so they bend over backwards to try and disguise it. Sure, they wont use words like â€œdisguiseâ€ though, will they? Theyâ€™ll use terms like â€œtextureâ€, â€œambianceâ€, and â€œmoodâ€. Ok, lets watch a bit more,

Ah, after all of the dreadful technical aspects of this student film, itâ€™s good to see that a storyline is developing. Hopefully, it will be so damn strong that it makes us forget about how god-awful everything else is. Back to the filmâ€¦"
,flatusgass,2010-11-13T09:33Z,"20 minutes in. I donâ€™t know how I made it this far. I didnâ€™t think the acting could get any worse then the early scenes with the Governor, and to be fair, it didnâ€™t. It stays equally bad though. The man playing the salty-old-dog with the Indian woman as his wife is easily the best actor in this film. Not saying much, I know. But at least he is somewhat tolerable, unlike the entire remainder of the cast. Lets see how much more I can takeâ€¦

I must say again, what horribly insulting green-screen work. Were they purposely trying to make it look as ridiculous as possible? Hey children, hereâ€™s a word of advice, when you use 'special effects', the whole point it to make it believable, not to DRAW ATTENTION TO IT for being highly sub-par. Isnt it the wish of those who have a fetish for special FX to have their viewers adore it? In this case, even the most non-technical viewer will invariably be shaking their heads at being torn from the story and focusing on the first-year student grade FX. It really feels like high school students made this. Okâ€¦lets continue,"

Until they remove it, of course. No one wants to hear the truth."
,countkurt,2010-11-14T11:53Z,"If you liked Whedon's Firefly, you'll like this. Mind you, there's no Hollywood budget, but it's obviously a labour of love."
,richardpa,2010-11-14T14:22Z,"Great copy and a quick download... 
A/10 
V/10 
Another VODO P2P release, nice to see that some directorâ€˜s and producerâ€˜s still believe that file sharing (P2P) is still the way forward in film making, better than those greedy ba****ds in Hollywood. 
The film is a grindhouse spaghetti western ""Cowboys on Motorcycles"" The movie was completely shot using green screen ""backlot technique"" processing so it has the look of Rodriguez ""Sin City"" layered animation and CGI shot onto real time movie footage, the director Kilian Manning must be a big Tarantino and Rodriguez fan because the movie is a bit like Kill Bill and Sin City meets Easy Rider in the snow... 
Thereâ€˜s no middle ground with this film, youâ€˜ll either love it or hate it!!! 
Many Thanx to VODO for keeping up the cause to promote free-to-share content to a global P2P audience...:):) 
Thanx to all the seeders for a Fast download...:) "

,rctalon417,2010-11-25T11:19Z,Good movie for the concept and being an independent film but BOOOO  for censoring the nudity after rating it for mature audiences!!
