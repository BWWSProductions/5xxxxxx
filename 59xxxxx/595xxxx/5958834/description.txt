GoGoRiki, known in the Russian Federation as Smeshariki (Russian: Ð¡Ð¼ÐµÑˆÐ°ÌÑ€Ð¸ÐºÐ¸), is a Russian animated television series consisting of 208 episodes of 6 minutes and 30 seconds each, aimed at children of 3 to 25 years. The first episode premiered in Russia on July 7, 2004. English-language distribution rights to the series were acquired by 4Kids Entertainment from worldwide distributor Fun Game Media, Munich[1] and began airing as part of The CW4Kids block on The CW on September 27, 2008.[2] Fun Game Media is also producing a German version, named Kikoriki, which began airing on KI.KA on December 8, 2008.[3][4]

The Smeshariki (the name is derived from "smeshnye" meaning "funny", and "shariki" meaning "little balls") are stylized rounded animals. Each of the 9 characters has a unique personality and a range of interests with no negative characters among them. Plots are built not on the battle of opposing forces but on the unexpected situations the animated characters stumble upon in their interactions deemed similar to the ones that children may encounter in their everyday lives. Much attention was devoted to the humor in the series, some of which has attracted adults as well.
