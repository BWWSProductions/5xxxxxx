Downloaded this yesterday. Great quality on both Audio and Video.

I was amazed at the quality since it's only 450 MBs. Wow is *.mkv genius or what? 
Would love to get some info on how mkv can producehigh-res on such a small size. Anybody care to enlighten me?

Also, I've bookmarked you, YIFY. :)"

,mat459,2011-03-30T05:27Z,"I know this is an old torrent, but i just downloaded yesterday. It looks like there is some compression problems with this. The video looks almost pixel-ated. I don't want to say it's YIFY right off, cuz he does such great work. Does anyone else have this problem too? Could it be a problem with my system or VLC player? I haven't had any trouble like this before with any torrents especially YIFY's. Any ideas greatly appreciated. Cheers"

bty love your work yify"
,greenroommedia,2011-11-27T09:08Z,"Doesn't work.  Tried VLC + MPlayer. Picture a mess.  Also includes hard-coded subtitles.  Don't bother, don't seed."
