A black comedy, dark thriller, cautionary tale  
- all rolled into one, Urf Professor is a story,
or rather four slices of a portly, asthmatic    
hitmanâ€™s cake. The roller coaster ride through  
the underbelly of Mumbai also features an       
assortment of other desperate characters -      
thief, pornstar, conwoman, quack, undertaker,   
tramp, mechanic etc.                           Ãž
A perverse brew of greed, fear, deceit, love,   
sex and death; low budget, no-brow and from    Â°
-the-hip.                                      Â°
