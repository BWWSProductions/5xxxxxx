My Sky Your City started as an electronica side project in October 2008. With the addition of new members the band quickly became much more than just a side project. Still retaining the digital/electronic aspect of our previous endeavors we added guitars, bass and drums to create a more mind blowing sound. We set out for a heavier, synth-infused sound. Problems occurred between a few band members which greatly delayed our progress. MSYC aims to be a positive, drug-free band. Our lyrics are inspirational and by no means intended to offend anyone.
