Stephen K Amos is guaranteed to provide you with the Feel Good 
Factor in this laugh a minute stand-up performance filmed in 
front of a sell-out audience at the Hammersmith Apollo.

Star of Montreal, Melbourne and Edinburgh festivals, Amos is a 
hit with critics and audiences alike and has a swagger of awards 
in tow. In fact he's so flipping good he's only gone and got his 
very own BBC show called, you guessed it 'The Stephen K Amos Show'! 

Stephen's the biggest thing to hit comedy in 2010!
