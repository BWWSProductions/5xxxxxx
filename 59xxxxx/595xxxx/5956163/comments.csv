Just to give you all fair warning, I will seeding out nearly 6GB of new stuff by the end of this evening (2weekends of F1 & MotoGP) and I only have a 2Mb upload limit - this will take some time! :("
,psira,2010-11-14T11:50Z,"youÂ´re a hero man!

hope u had a nice time in scotland
:-D"
,vale_quarantasei,2010-11-14T16:58Z,"finally teedee is back..i've been followed you since last years..and there's no torrent motogp coverage as good as yours..yours is um..profound..the coverage in my country is absolutely rubbish..although the the comentator in bbc is not great either..compare to the eurosport duo..do bbc show motogp review this year??will you uploading it as well??(sorry if my english isn't so well coz i'm from the ""semakin di depan"" language country;D..)"
,zosher,2010-11-16T18:38Z,"tdmk, 
thank you!  i'd buy you a beer.

p.s. i find motogp by far most interesting than f1 as f1 is really hard to pass.  best action from f1 is when to pit.  is there forums for motogp on bbc the same way they have for f1?   especially this year, an emotional one due to vale and casey's departure from the factories which gave em such support and success.
Thank you again!"
,dpance,2010-11-17T19:52Z,"Thanks for another full year of the preferred BBC coverage of MotoGP.  I'm really spoiled by these downloads.  For what it's worth, I'll be seeding for years to come the 2009 and 2010 seasons.  My computer stays on 24 X 7...

Hope that you'll be uploading in 2011 as next year is really going to be outstanding with all the rider changes.  March 20th (Quatar) will be here before you know it!

Glad you had safe travels to & from Scotland.  Thanks to you and your wife for all the SUPERB MotoGP content.

My best!!!  :)"
