,xiIix,2010-11-16T10:24Z,"And those hardware requirements aren't a joke, you need a fast rig to play games at 100%. Opt for PAL versions of games whenever possible.

AZ, I still don't know where you're getting these version numbers. I think I commented about it on another torrent, but I can't find these versions of the EXE or the GSdx on the site, not even the betas. I have the very newest and when it boots it's giving me 

For the EXE: PCSX2 0.9.7.r3876 (modded) - compiled on Oct  5 2010

And r3693 is the newest GSdx I can find on the site as well."

,AZkiller7,2010-11-16T13:30Z,One thing i forgot to mention. You can always compile your own builds using TortoiseSVN and Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 (preferably the full edition). Here's an easy step-by-step tutorial of how to download and compile the trunk.

,rwatlin,2010-11-17T22:52Z,"How do I use bios if it says. ""PCSX2 requires a legal copy of the PS2 Bios in order to run games""
its not accepting the bios that has come with this program."

,AZkiller7,2010-11-17T23:11Z,"all the BIOS files i provided work just fine, probably you just need to set the BIOS directory within the configuration"
,oriug,2010-11-20T03:33Z,"AZk: how do i load savestates from previous releases on this? it doesn't work to just copypasta the sstates-folder over to the new release and then try to load from that. i just get ""no savestate found"" when i try to load a savestate... how do i make them work in the new release? i must use a new release because the old release does not work with windows 7 ultimate."
,420Friendly,2010-12-15T09:43Z,this PCSX2 download works great for me i have downloaded it from other peaple and it never worked but this 1 plays perfect thanks alot
,buddyk9,2010-12-21T03:44Z,"alright, i usually pride myself for know more about computers than most people i know, but trying to get this to work is making me feel retarded. going through the settings and its all foreign to me. im glad i at least got it to see the plugins, just went it comes up, the console says, ""(GameDB) Database Not Found!"" and ""HLE Warning: ELF does not have a path!!""
also, not quite sure but i think the fact that it says, ""GSnull:Setting the crc to '0' with 0x0 for options."" might be a problem too. I got all the files in this torrent, just dont know what im doing wrong"
,algieba78,2011-01-01T22:19Z,"Thanks azkiller7, your pcsx2 uploads are great, I have already used several of them. This build in particular is VERY fast, and I managed to get full or playable speeds on games that were unplayable before on my 2.4Ghz Q6600 (eg Dark Cloud, Dragon Quest VIII). I recommend it to everyone."
,420Friendly,2011-01-04T20:20Z,"i already played and beat a couple games with this  now i am trying too play Front mission 4 im stuck at the beginning part when they launch the wanzer out of the back of theďťż plane Runs really smooth up until that point, but then the screen justďťż goes black. do u know if their is a way too fix this??"
,Reviewer,2011-02-12T01:12Z,"Thanks for the upload, works great.........

However I get shitty FPS , and no it's now my hardware. I nearly double the recommended system requirements. Latest updates and all. FPS starts at 59.00 during load then drops to 9.00 during game play. One game in particular actually (Shadow of the Colossus) as I must admit I've only tried one game with this emulator. Any config settings I can use to raise the frame rates? Perhaps a different BIOS selection, or even PAL vs. NTSC ? 

Give it to me lightly fellows, I'm afraid my ego only allows a limited amount of abuse. "
,rj32202,2011-02-27T02:50Z,Everything works fine untill it asks me for the aspect ratio.  It will not accept any input.  Even though I mapped the keys.
,LaggerGuy,2011-08-12T15:20Z,"hi
pc noob here :3
