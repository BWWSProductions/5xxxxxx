While this tape did not suffer from the processing and alterations that noise reduction systems cause, it did add equalization and compression to the original recording and had an inexplicable flaw in the left channel during the first three minutes of Pursuance.   The tape was not physically flawed, so it must be assumed that the problem was caused in the 1971 transfer process.
This situation was a cause of great concern until it occured to us that A Love Supreme was originally issued in 1965 in territories other than the United States.  The hope was that we could find a contemporaneous copy of the original master that would not have this affliction.  A March 1965 master was found at EMIs London vaults and dispatched to New York.  Not only was the problem absent on that tape, but it had no added equalization or compression.  A relieved Rudy Van Gelder declared it to be as close to the real thing as one could get in the analog domain without having the original tape. This tape preserves the sonic details with vivid accuracy: Elvins cymbals, the deep intensity of the vocal chant, and the openness of the group sound.
There are other uploads of this album out there but I wanted to post this excerpt from the liner notes of this version.  Its an extremely important piece of work for me....... It is said that Coltrane was spoken to by God before he recorded this.  A Love Supreme is Coltranes recognition that his talent comes from God.  This is Coltranes gift to Him. "
