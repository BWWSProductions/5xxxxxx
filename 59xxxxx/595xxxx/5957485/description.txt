MacScan 2.7 Removes Spyware and Tracking Cookies.

Please read the instructions BEFORE you try it on your own and come here and say it doesn't work! (below is also included in a text file) I tested this on a Late 2009 Macbook w/ Snow Leopard 10.6.5 

After Installing from the package Drag MacScan to the MacScan 2 Folder (the one that automatically opens after the installer is finished) and it will ask you to replace. Replace it IF you have Little Snitch (which you should)

Found On Appledll.net and thought the bay would like.

Little Snitch settings:
Always DENY:  TCP connections:  store-esellerate-net.wip.digitalriver.com
ALWAYS ALLOW connections to  macscan.securemac.com 
(That way it can't call home but you will still get the latest updates)

If you don't have Little Snitch, use the trial version (BEFORE replacing) to upgrade your spyware definitions and your cookie blacklist THEN replace and then seriously consider Little Snitch.

This is NOT my torrent, I tested it out, put in better instructions, and repackaged, This was done for sharing not for glory, /Sarcasm [ON] OFF/ but please let the name Anonymous reign on high /Sarcasm ON [OFF]/
