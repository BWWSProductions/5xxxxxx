,hauntnut,2010-11-20T22:16Z,"Here are the tech specs for this download: 

VIDEO 
Codec: H.264/AVC
Size: 1280x536
Bitrate: 3047 kpbs
Frame Rate: 23.976/sec

AUDIO (specs same for both codecs)

Sample Rate: 48000 Hz

Video and audio quality are great! No difference between the DTS and AC3 tracks that I could discern, so either or is pretty much identical. Thanks to the uploader!"
