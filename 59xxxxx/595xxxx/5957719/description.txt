Release Info:

A trip to the swamps will demonstrate the breathtaking experience that
Two Worlds II has to offer. The result of Reality Pump's extensive technical
development, the game's environment has been painstakingly created to fully
immerse the player into the Antaloorian universe. For example, the marshy
ground sucks at the character's feet hindering his movement more so then
if he was on dry land
