,kdallas2010,2010-12-04T02:45Z,@.BONE.  I don't suppose you have a verified SS/DMI combo for the XEX ?  I've not seen anything up on abgx yet and was worried about stealth etc.
,apwhitelaw,2011-01-07T05:34Z,"Damn no NTSC? Anyways, is there any way to play before release without getting banned? I remember people were playing Halo Reach all the time before it came out. They were streaming it on Justin.TV. I don't get how they didn't get banned."
,Dimka2010,2011-02-21T14:01Z,Seems abit strange the game going up in november 2010 when the game comes out in feb a whole 3 months early?
,Spollero,2011-04-14T20:49Z,The game came earlier in Europe you self-centered morons.
