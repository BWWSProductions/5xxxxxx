absolutely blown away by this album, amazing isnt the word, its spectacular!
the flood is a masterstroke and a great lead single, but songs like kidz, happy now, sos affirmation and eight letters are magic moments, ive been a fan for a while and i was very sceptical about the reunion but i have to say the album is the best ive heard in the last few years! Back for good? lets hope so!

Progress is Take That's sixth studio album, and the first to feature the full line up of Gary Barlow, Mark Owen, Howard Donald, Jason Orange and Robbie Williams since 1995's Somebody Else. The album features the single "The Flood"
