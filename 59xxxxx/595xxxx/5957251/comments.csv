,bakaonna,2010-11-17T18:46Z,"Best Starcraft clone, IMO, and a very good RTS. I already have it, so I can't say anything about the torrent's quality."
,draykon,2011-01-04T10:46Z,"i'm downloading it,great speed and hope it'll work and NO viruses. Thanx i was rlly looking for this game,brb and tell if it works!"
,phobias,2011-01-24T20:00Z,"didn't work on my win 7 32bit pc...
gave an error like ""couldn't read file""...
i think this game needs to be installed properly, instead of directory copying..
will give http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4477067/Armies.Of.Exigo-HOODLUM a shot..."
,JCIce,2011-05-22T06:28Z,"I am on Windows 7 64 bit and this game works perfectly.

Simply run Exigo.exe from folder its in.

Thank you for this upload."

,hamsterush,2012-03-25T13:01Z,"pls help i have windows 7 and video card of 1,5 gb and it says that my video card doesn't meet the minimum requiements"
,Kamianbu,2012-04-19T00:54Z,Then it probably doesn't. Just because the card's size is large doesn't mean it has the necessary drivers and other things that game may use.
