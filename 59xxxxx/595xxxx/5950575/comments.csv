,bandroidx,2010-11-12T11:42Z,"Thank you thankyou thank you!!! I just watched 14 that you uploaded and was dying to see the next one.  

I proudly pirated this show (by downloading this torrent) fuck syfy for canceling a great show after they ruined it.  It is just starting to get good and finally starting to tie in to BSG and things are making sense and BSG fans must be feeling the same way???

Thankyou for uploading man!! please grab next weeks (how many did they make before they canceled? anyone know?"
