,madbit,2010-11-21T01:48Z,Anyone else having A/V sync issues with this one? (Zoom Player + CoreAVC)
,SteelArmz,2010-11-22T10:58Z,"No A/V problems, just one peeve. The guy in the front row blocking Hatsune Miku with his giant leek the entire time needs to die."
,madbit,2010-11-22T17:22Z,"What player/codec/version/etc did you use?
So far I've been able to play any 1080p video in .mkv format with no problems, but this one is making me crazy."
,madbit,2010-11-23T13:44Z,"Nevermind, apparently it was a bug in Haali Media Splitter when handling MP4 files. Updated version to 21/11/2010 and now works like a charm. :)"
