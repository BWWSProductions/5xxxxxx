Please excuse my "recently not-posting at all syndrome", but life has been quite hectic lately. Now I hope this upload makes up for my absence! Here's a big thank you to Frankie teardrop (system of romance blog) for finding a copy and ripping Industrie's record! All credits go to him. I decided to post it as it's a true obscure gem that needs to be introduced to a wider audience. Alright, enjoy the music and keep seeding!
