,nelwyn,2011-07-27T06:56Z,"This was my last torrent. I don't know what happened, but my account lost all traces of my torrents like it was deleted so I had to make another one. Weird I can search for them, but nothing shows under my name anymore. Unfortunately, I won't be uploading any more Kate episodes though. "

Ty for all the good times Nelwyn you were an awesome uploader :D
