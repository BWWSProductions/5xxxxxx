Evelyn Salt is a CIA agent and highly respected by all, including her boss, 
Ted Winter. Out of the blue, a Russian spy walks into their offices and offers 
a vital piece of information: the President of Russia will be assassinated during 
his forthcoming visit to New York City to attend the funeral of the recently 
deceased U.S. Vice President. The name of the assassin: Evelyn Salt. Concerned 
about the safety of her husband, who she cannot contact, she goes on the run.

begin to raise doubts. Just who is Evelyn Salt and what is she planning?
