"Trouble" is a song by Lindsey Buckingham. It was the biggest hit off the album Law and Order, which was released in 1981. It was also Buckingham's first hit as a solo artist.

"Trouble" was the only song on the album that Buckingham didn't play bass or drums on; his Fleetwood Mac bandmate Mick Fleetwood was brought in to do the drums. Things didn't work out very well in the recording session, and a taped loop of the drum track, about four-seconds long, was used over and over for the song.[1] The song is sung in a light falsetto.

The single would become a #9 hit in the US in early 1982. It topped the charts in Australia for 3 weeks.

In the UK, it was released on the Mercury Records label. It entered the UK singles charts on 16 January 1983, rising to a high of number 31, and it remained in the chart for 7 weeks.[2]

The distinctive music video for "Trouble" features a multi-instrumental "big-band" featuring a plethora of male musicians, including Mick Fleetwood.

The song appears in the film Just One of the Guys during the blind date.
