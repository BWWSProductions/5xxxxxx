
There have been already a few, though minor, bugs in Football 2011 - including international bans for French players or an incorrect yellow card suspension rule in Spain.
 
Sports Interactive has made available the Football Manager 2010 Patch 11.1.1, which solves, except of the two mentioned above, a bug with players registration for promoted or demoted teams. The full list of changes has been placed at Sports Interactive forums.

In addition, an issue occurring in the official editor, related to incorrect play-off matches, has also been corrected.

Run The Update.exe and let it install and update your game!!

Play the game!!

I have included the Crack.exe if you need it, I originally downloaded the Russian version(P2P) of FM2011 and used the RELOADED Crack and I didnâ€™t need to use this Crack!!

Enjoy!!
