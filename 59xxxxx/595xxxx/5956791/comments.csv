[V],AlbaGuBrath,2010-11-16T18:39Z,"@ Dimmis80 ""We always recommend running the latest version of the game. However you do not need to start a new game to be able to use the patch, you can continue your save games from both the demo and the original version of Football Manager 2011. However if you want the latest database you will need to start a new game."" Source - http://community.sigames.com/showthread.php/233554

I've updated the game and done the patch.. i've even got the patch from fm11 site.. i've also updated with the patch in this file...  i've copied the crack over and such..


my question is... when i start new game it asks with patch 11.1.0  ... is it suppose to say that or is it suppose to say 11.1.1   ? cuz i mean i've downloaded official patchs n stuff. copied cracks and yeah, i guess i just need some confirmation. is it suppose to say 11.1.0
