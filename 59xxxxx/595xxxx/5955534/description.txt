This download contains every PalmOS game made by Kurt Dekker, who once ran PLBM Games, an independent development company that made made DOS and PalmOS games. In 2007, he released his games as freeware. Being as old and obscure as it is, who knows when the site (www.plbm.com) could go down. Thus, to preserve these great games, I have taken the liberty of uploading them for all of you to see.  Kurt no longer supports these games, so technical difficulties are your problem. Below is the list of games.
