,JackTheForest,2011-02-12T19:56Z,Wow its really rare to find real 1080p uplaods above 20GB in MKV Format! Please Seed webchella!
,euphoria4949,2011-07-23T20:22Z,"Well it's 22GB so as you would expect it's amazing quality.

English & Spanish audio as well as subs for both.
1 click to turn them on or off.

Ok it only has 1 seed, well 2 as I'm seeding now as
well, so the DL speed was poor. Averaged under 100KB/s so it took me 5 days to complete. 

So if you impatient and want it yesterday go download a massively compressed version somewhere else.
BUT if you can wait the quality is really worth it.

Brilliant thanks webchella :) 
I'll seed for long as possible to keep it alive"
