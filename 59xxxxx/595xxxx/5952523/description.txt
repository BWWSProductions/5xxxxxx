The third album by the group many listeners feel is John Abercrombieâ€™s best-ever
band. The American guitarist has always been, by his own account, both a
â€œtraditionalist and a free playerâ€. The same can be claimed of is colleagues
here who share a strong sense for form also while improvising
together. Abercrombie: â€œThe free improvs sound more like chamber music rather
than free jazz nowâ€: not only a reflection on the emphasis on strings â€“ guitar,
violin, bass â€“ but also of the advanced harmonic awareness of Mark Feldman, Marc
Johnson and the leader.
