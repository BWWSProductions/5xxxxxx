,iggy56,2010-11-14T11:54Z,why put something up on piratebay and not seed
,DenP,2010-11-14T11:58Z,"Language: Polish, canal Polsat Sport & Sport Extra"
,l3wis2000,2010-11-14T12:25Z,There are no seeds!!!!!
,bootzky,2010-11-14T12:25Z,there is nothing here! come on man. seed!
,l3wis2000,2010-11-14T12:26Z,"This is a waste of time, anyone have another tracker, im scared to look, dont want to know the result."
,carlorocci,2010-11-14T12:28Z,"Are you knocked-out, that's why you don't seed?"
,bootzky,2010-11-14T13:41Z,still no seed? maybe the whole thing was a fake. damn.
,goffyoflegend,2010-11-14T13:45Z,for some reason lately all new torrents show 0 seeds 0 leechs for a while. this torrent seems to be downloading just fine as far as i can see.
,novus310,2010-11-14T13:49Z,seeds guys
,ppctx,2010-11-14T15:38Z,"20min or so till it completes DL but despite seeing 0SE/0LE, this is downloading FAST.  Thanks!"
,bootzky,2010-11-14T16:48Z,Downloading at .2kbs with a red indicator arrow. None of the peers have 100%. Are we downloading the right stuff?? this is strange & a bit.... suspicious.
,mvfreeman,2010-11-14T16:58Z,Until some one starts seeding this thing the most you can expect to get is around 49% of the file.
,OneTwoWilliams,2010-11-14T17:24Z,"Can anyone even verify this file? the guy has no uploads then suddenly gets the Haye and pacquiao fights before anyone else, bit suspicious, plus doesn't even stick around to see, noob, glad I'm getting in from demonoid 500+ seeds"
,OneTwoWilliams,2010-11-14T17:29Z,"Until anyone can veryify this file I wouldn't even bother trying, the guys got no other uploads then suddenly gets the Haye & Pacquiao fights before anyone else, and then is that noob he doesn't even stick around to seed, pfff whatever"
,Googleplex777,2010-11-14T17:48Z,"THANKS!!!
I will seed this like crazy!!"
,alfdog3,2010-11-14T19:35Z,"I guess Polish is better than nothing, maybe we can get an English upload soon"
,Rafy0003,2010-11-14T19:58Z,Polish?!? So that what [PL] stands for...FUCK!!
,paitan,2010-11-14T20:29Z,"yups just got thru leeching and im seeding now!!

this is the main event but the fight narration/commentator is speaking in PL or POLISH!!

if don't mind it, its still the full main event bout!!

Good luck!!

Im looking for the HBO PPV version!!
"
,Rafy0003,2010-11-14T20:59Z,"This is the real thing, Thanks DenP, Quality is about a 7. But it is in Polish...Only thing I understand is Manny Packio and Malgarito...lol Good upload, Will be seeding till I finish downloading the other 1."
,konzdorig,2010-11-14T21:04Z,its great... just choose the magnet link
,ppctx,2010-11-14T21:07Z,this is not in engrish
,carlorocci,2010-11-14T22:56Z,"This is a great fight. Download people and seed 1:10. ^_^.

Thanks DenP."
,lulubell420,2010-11-15T00:45Z,Is it safe to downlaod if there  isnt a little skull saying its apprived by pirate bay?
,lulubell420,2010-11-15T00:46Z,Is it safe to download this if there is no little skull thing saying its trusted by pirate bay?
,lulubell420,2010-11-15T00:47Z,is it safe to dl something that doesnt have a little skull saying its trusted?
,OneTwoWilliams,2010-11-15T17:05Z,"NO!! if you download something with no skull your PC will EXPLODE!!!

actually the skull just means that the uploaded is trusted, but thats not to say that people without skulls are not to be trusted, there are many great uploaders without skulls, in the case that an uploader doesnt have a skull, just be a bit more carefull, a good start is to just read the comments and see what other people say, fakes/virus's are usually recognised and deleted from the site pretty fast"
,GOLDENSEED27,2010-11-16T07:50Z,Blazing speed... Thx
,the_orbs,2010-11-17T12:58Z,Great speed  thanks
,Kurt23407,2010-11-26T03:40Z,"Lol im honestly not disapointed about the polish commentary, becuz Jim and the other HBO host we're extremely biased and all for Pacquiao. Margarito had a great round 5 and 6. Otherwise all Pacuqiao!!!! "
