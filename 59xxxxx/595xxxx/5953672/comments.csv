,tronsolo,2010-11-13T16:36Z,"@xeusoi16 I agree, I took the time to download the 2 that everybody else has downloaded, and neither one has worked for me at all, Ive read all the comments on how to get them working and NOTHING."

,karliboy,2010-11-17T17:49Z,"dunt work for me, wont even read the disc. is it because my wii is pal by any chance?"
,mojobaby27,2010-11-17T19:49Z,"Anyone else have a prob converting this one from iso to wbfs? Ive never had this prob before, and i ran sfv and all files ok, but wii backup manager,won""t put this file in list to check, it just says added in far right, but can't tick file to transfer to wbfs?? any ideas?? thanks"
,mojobaby27,2010-11-17T21:36Z,No matter what program I use to convert from iso to wbfs it says invalid wii disc.  Never had that problem before with any other iso. May be bad disc.
,mojobaby27,2010-11-17T21:40Z,"to answer karliboy, i would definitley get a pal format for a pal machine. the last COD. would not work for me going pal to NTSC, but got the NTSC on my NTSC machine and it worked great.
Now if I could only get this version to convert, starting to think bad version."
,rohitchangappa,2010-11-17T22:11Z,mojobaby27 having the same prob exratcted the file and used wfsb to get it on my hard drive. gives me a message saying that its completed adding it on to the hard drive but i see nothing. donno where to go from here. also downloaded the ntsc copy from .bone gets stuck on loading. guess just wait till there are more download options
,stretch25,2010-11-18T00:58Z,"pm-codbo.iso is a normal iso file i can open it winrar in this iso we have screenshots , video and wallpaper folder with content in each one.. and a file named cod_bo_wii with no extension and i tried iso ciso and wbfs and nothing works for that file... and the nfo doesnt say anything so i wouldnt even waste your time with this"
,r0cket,2010-11-18T15:18Z,"This is a fake!

It will not work, which brings into question the first few comments from xoahii54, and wuaboi183.

And yes, Wii Backup Manager will not even recognize it as a valid Wii ISO."
,siddthesquid,2010-11-18T23:59Z,"theres a bunch of crap in this download, dont waste ur time with this one"
,seeloa81,2010-11-19T01:33Z,Wii Backup Manager looks ok to me? what version are you using????
,goffyoflegend,2010-11-22T12:15Z,"got it working last night. just went on youtube and found a tutorial.couldn't get multiplayer online to work though, but i believe there is a fix for that. r0cket you should try doing that first before shouting FAKE, you bellend."
,vidguy497,2010-11-29T00:36Z,"I'm calling BS on this one.
If I'm not mistaken the uploader made a fake iso 4.37GB (just like a legit iso) and filled it with a lot of crap, i.e. videos, wallpapers, screenshots, and then added a file without an extension called cod_bo_wii.  I've tried giving this file all sorts of extensions and I've tried opening it with many different programs and it doesn't work.  I'm inclined to think the whole thing is a box of confetti.

As for the people who said it worked, tell me how 'cause it looks like a fake to me.

And @goffyoflegend, dont call ppl dicks unless you have proof they are."
,jhrea,2010-11-29T05:21Z,"THIS is a FAKE!!!
The iso not real.  cod_bo_wii file is an emtpy file
I used a hex editor and it filled with Zeros,   Please remove this torrent.  its a Fake."
,TiTOp64izGonnaKillu,2010-12-14T19:35Z,"I'm gonna have to agree with the other guys that this torrent is fake and gay. I already unscramble the file into a real iso, but absolutely no progress has been gained. WBFS don't recognize it well which causes it to not be able to calculate an size estimation and just instantly transfers it to the drive which obviously it's not. IDK what you get out of uploading a fake file whether it's just a cruel joke or something but it seriously sucks."
,Mike_98h_98h,2011-02-06T17:20Z,"This download doe's not work and will get you flagged for copyright infringement, I know it happened to me for downloading this and it didn't even work, this isn't even a correct size Wii iso anyway!!!!!!!!!
