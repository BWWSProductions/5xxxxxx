Also keep seeding dont just hit and run , seed as fast as your isp lets u upload ,the faster your upload speed the faster your download speed is for recieving data thats how bittorent works !im not a hypocrite sometimes when i go 2 post info tpb says database error failed to write..i dont have time 2  go back 2 the files i couldnt help out on , A good place to get help is http://forum.suprbay.org/index.php report fake files or drm files there.
 ,ps if you look at porn remember to respect women theyre gods greatest creation. torrentday your not doing yourselves any good by releasing torrents you fail to seed why would we bother going to your site if we think you fail to seed so many of your releases ?

A/10 
V/10
couldn't get the subs to work so I got the English subtitles from opensubtitles and here's the link:  http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3951705/bal-en
Really good Turkish movie and well worth the download...
Many Thanx to TvTeam and Ltu for an Excellent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)
the original title for the movie is Bal (honey), hence the subtitles are listed under bal-en...not Honey."
