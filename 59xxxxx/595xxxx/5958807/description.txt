Plot.............: The young boy Yusuf's best friend is his father,
who supports his family's modest life with the honey he collects
from tall trees in the forests of the remote Turkish countryside.
Yusuf is a quiet boy, and his mother is concerned for his future.
Perhaps he will follow in his father's footsteps, or perhaps school
will offer him other opportunities. But the honey crop is failing,
and Yusuf has trouble learning how to read. The greatest fear strikes
when Yusuf's father doesn't return home from the forest.
