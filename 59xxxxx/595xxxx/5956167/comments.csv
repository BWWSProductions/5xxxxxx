Just to give you all fair warning, I will seeding out nearly 6GB of new stuff by the end of this evening (2weekends of F1 & MotoGP) and I only have a 2Mb upload limit - this will take some time! :("
,Bulldog_swe,2010-11-14T12:28Z,"Thank you mate, nice to see you that you are back."
,funji,2010-11-14T12:42Z,That's great!  I will help seed the f1 qualifying and race. Got 10mb up. Although right now i'm downloading in 20kbs so will take some time. Thanks for this torrent. Will you upload the race today as well?
,duplo77,2010-11-14T14:49Z,Good to have you back:) Been missing your F1-torrents.. Thank you for this season of F1. Hope you're back for 2011 season too..:)

tdmk1: Thanks for you great caps. I really appreciate. Wish the seeding went faster... but that's life."
,pooloop,2010-11-14T18:49Z,"yes i do cos its great,f1 on here is fucked now,and you all know who to thank"
,mutineer,2010-11-14T22:17Z,"Thanks TDMK, great to see you back, what a fantastic season, and you have been there all along, very much appreciated by many, many people. Cheers Bud.

Now..
as for that knobgobbler pooloop, he ups a lot of footie torrents and I have already posted results for at least one of his matches in the torrent comments. I encourage all you F1 fans here to do the same, payback can be a bitch and that particular bitch needs to learn a lesson, maybe turnabout really IS fair play.
What a goof."
,mobban99,2010-11-14T22:20Z,pooloop i hope its was whorth it your purple name will be gone now so thank you now we will se you as Anonymous
,MDBR,2010-11-14T22:21Z,"pooloop: That wasn't cool man. I don't know how old you are but that was a very immature thing to do. I just wanted you to know that you have ruined my day now, and I hope that one day, you'll realise that all your actions have consequences (in this day, you've ruined the race for many of us who didn't watch the race).
   I wish you good luck in life - you'll probably to young to understand how much damage and anger you've caused today... and I hope that you and other trolls reading this think twice before spoiling races (read: being douche-bags online).

TDMK1: Thanks for all your ULs this year, hope to see you again next year! 

TPB users:Try to seed as much as you can, sharing is caring :P "

,iLTB,2010-11-15T02:30Z,"pooloop: Here I've been dodging every kinda news source there is all fucking day, and here you come with your ugly piece-of-shit-name and ruin everything. Thank you, you Dickhead."
,pooloop,2010-11-15T03:24Z,"welcome ,cant wait for next season so i can say the results,its great here as people do what they like"
