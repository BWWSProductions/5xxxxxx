Inner Earth, Egypt & Consciousness

Date: 10-25-10
Host: George Noory
Guests: Brooks Agnew, Laura Lee Mistycah, Ronnie Rennae Foster

Electrical Engineer and Doctor of Physics Brooks Agnew discussed ancient Egypt, new physics, cosmology, consciousness, and time travel. He also shared an update on his planned North Pole Inner Earth Expedition, which could now take place in the summer of 2012 along the Arctic Circle, pending the availability of an icebreaker ship. The expedition also faces funding issues, which has delayed it in the past. Interestingly, he noted there is research that shows there could be a large ocean that lies underneath the crust of the Atlantic ocean.

Finding the Inner Earth could prove to be especially beneficial if the planet faces a global catastrophe, he said. According to a manuscript found in Abydos, Egypt, the ancient Egyptians might have fled to the Inner Earth to escape a cataclysm, possibly at a desert town called Damenhur. As part of Agnew's upcoming Egyptian Tour, they will stop at Damenhur to investigate this location.

Citing how time slows down at the speed of light, Agnew said he is able to experience a kind of time travel while practicing a 17th breath meditation, in which he goes to a world that has a different sky than Earth's. He also talked about physics research that indicates certain particles are coming into our universe from another dimension. There is a missing construct in physics which may involve human consciousness in the formation of matter, he added.

Ghost Rescuers
Intuitive counselor Ronnie Rennae Foster and Wiccan practitioner Laura Lee Mistycah, known as the 'Ghost Buster Gals,' appeared in the first hour. The two are not traditional ghost busters but could be thought of as "ghost rescuers for souls that are lost or stuck or caught in between worlds," Foster explained. Mistycah talked about how she uses a "stone of truth" to access information at haunted sites and reverse curses.
