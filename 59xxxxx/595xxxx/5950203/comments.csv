[T],insinuendo,2010-11-12T00:10Z,It's gonna take alot more than 16mins to make this a better movie :)
,hello40204,2010-11-12T14:22Z,"not here to critisize the movie . figure hollywood had made really bad movies lately , like all those cheap crappy comedies at 2 dollars .

however i enjoy avatar, but could somebody upload the extended full bdrip .
i myself had different encoding and can tell you that the full version was way better than any encoding compressed of this movie i saw .
thanks"
,TheSpenner,2010-11-12T16:57Z,"The subs are not hardcoded.
Soft subs for english - na'vi parts only, or english whole movie."
,ramujamu,2010-11-13T02:17Z,i'm not sure abt this one.. extebted ver. is releasing on the 16 of nov.. 4 days from now...
,TheSpenner,2010-11-13T07:13Z,"What aren't you sure about? Blurays usually show up on torrent sites a couple of weeks before ""release"". I guess they get them from initial factory pressings or something. At any rate, I've already d/l'd this and it's legit... well, it's what it says it is, maybe not ""legit"" since it's on TBP ;-)"
,hello40204,2010-11-14T14:34Z,"anybody for the full disc of avatar extended. this other guy just upload 1400 files of a mess of this movie . the main file is 10 gb and others are 2 gb in average and small ones  . what the heck is he doing  . anyway, if somebody can do the main movie just without re-encoding it. would be great to upload . thanks "
,darklink9,2010-11-17T01:15Z,Thanks. Would be great if you could upload disc 2-3 aswell with all the extra material. In atleast 720p. I'm really interested in how they made the movie.

Although I was sad because I didn't get a chance to see it when it was out for the second time with the extra scenes... Being able to see this movie in 1080p with the extra scenes was amazing!!! Took 7 days to download but totally worth the wait!!!

,rastan7,2011-02-01T03:37Z,How do you convert the DTS audio to ac3 so that you can watch it on tv?
,Hazzy420eyes,2011-02-10T17:17Z,"FYI: (Especially to the noobies) A lot of people are getting busted for piracy downloading Avatar, Inception, basically any big name in cinema off of Pirate Bay. Get an IP protector like Peer Guardian OR THEY WILL SUE YOU AND CRASH YOUR COMPUTER< NO JOKE DON'T TAKE THIS LIGHTLY. TO HELP, COPY N PAST THIS MESSAGE ON WHATEVER YOU DOWNLOAD"
,TheAre1973,2011-02-11T05:41Z,"MKV comes out so grainy on my Macs. People, MP4 is much better to encode with. Windows people use MKV and they suck as much as flash sucks."

Why not convert this release to MP4 yourself?  It's not hard."
,astrea1406,2011-03-09T23:27Z,"I don't know about you all, but this file shocked me - I did not know my monitor can have this clear and unbelievable picture. No grains at all! And the look of it on 42"" lcd tv is :O I love it. This is the best torrent I've ever downloaded! "
,Mathlol,2011-03-10T21:11Z,"To everyone complaining and having problems, get his 720p instead.My explanation is below.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5947605/Avatar.2009.EXTENDED.720p.BluRay.x264-BestHD

Here's some free info that could solve some question.  You will only notice the difference if your screen size is > 40 inches and you sit closer than 7 feet to the screen.  If you don't have the entertainment center to handle, view to these specs, get the 720p."
,nikkimau5,2011-04-29T03:14Z,"Okay, so I'm new to the whole BluRay thing, I just bought a laptop that plays BluRay movies... So I figured I'd download one :P Anyways, no idea how to play the movies? I tried playing it on divx player plus and i have all the codecs installed and what not, but it won't play on there... so i downloaded arcsoft totalmedia theatre 5 and i figured it'd play it. Nope... still can't seem to figure out what program to play it on, or if I'm supposed to convert it or what?"
,wumi031,2011-04-29T13:49Z,the whole movie is out of sync. is it just 4me or....?

,Mutegrill,2011-05-23T12:59Z,"And remember, Imagebeam did automatically convert the used .png:s into .jpg:s, wich means they got compressed, wich means lower quality of the pics you see. Thus, in real life the experience om the picture quality will be enhanced, from experts eyes point of view!"
,Mutegrill,2011-05-23T14:41Z,"To rid all confusions on file formats:

A file is a file is a file! For instance: A text file containing the numeric combination 123 is very hard to view in other ways than the stated, namely 123. All files on computors are (simplified) built up by numerics, based on zeros (voltage off) and ones (voltage on).

Solely based on the stored file information: One specific mkv-file does NOT show up better/worse or with more/less grainy quality on different brands of computors, mac or pc! The experience of a specific movie is ALWAYS depended on a few things:

1. The factual quality stored in the file.

2. The speed and workload capability of your computers hardware and software, also knows as THE BOTTLENECK EFFECT.

3. Lastly, and very important, but often forgotten: The way your installed movie viewing software HANDLES the information on the movie file! Vlc treats and views an mkv-file differently than Media Player Classic, based on for instance codecs and compability with the movie file.

There is one GREAT guide online, which I cannot link to due to piratebay rules, but do this exact search on google (quotaion marks included):

""Digital Video File Formats Explained""

There (videoproductiontips) Lorraine Grula explains in an easy way how it all works with compression and different movie files.

So people, please try and not put blame based om what you donĂÂ´t know nothing about. Make shure to educate yourself instead, before you bark your self to Hades! And STOP all that name calling, it really is nasty and not very polite, just hope you don't treat your kids or loved ones that way..."

,Mutegrill,2012-01-24T15:30Z,"PVF14: There is no problem.

You RARELY see any faults in contributions the skull awarded uploaders do. When dealing with stuttering, freezing and so on: Go back to the download page! If the comments point to the fact that many can play the file without problems, the laws of LOGIC tells you there is something wrong or lacking about YOUR computer. Any other options are out of the question, unless - of course - you are just plain stubborn, stupid or those who commented they are satisfied are lying.

It's like with games for pc or them Xboxes etc: The newer the game, the higher performance a pc/box demanded (ram, mhz, video graphics card etc).

Either you convert the file to a playable state, or you wait until you can afford a better pc. That's what I did two weeks ago: Before I could NOT play this file without conversion, but now, WOW!!! I bought an Acer Aspire Laptop, 320Gb Hd, 3Gb Ram with better video graphics. It has opened up a whole new world for me!!! Even Firefox behave like a charm, without stealing memory!!!"
