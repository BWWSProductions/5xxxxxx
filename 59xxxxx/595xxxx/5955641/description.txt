Hey im back again with command and conquer generals with working crack AND the expansion Zero hour WITH a working crack =D
u will need daemon tools lite and winrar to get everything fully working extract all the files into another folder use daemon tools lite to mount disc one of command and conquer generals after it says insert disc 2 mount disc 2 then continue when installation is finished u can either replace the original exe file from program files/ea games/command and conquer and put the exe file from the crack folder and drag it into the the folder command and conquer generals when it ask if you want to replace say yes OR you can go ahead and install the EXPANSION zero hour the same way you did the first game and there is a file generals.exe take that after u install the expansion and put it in program files/ea games/command and conquer generals zero hour yes to replace NOW everything should work if u have any problems just leave a comment with your question and i will get back to you ASAP =)enjoy the game
