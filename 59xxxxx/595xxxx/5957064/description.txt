SOURCES:

VIDEO:Russian cam.......Thanks
AUDIO:OWN

NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.......... Easy A

Right first the sources .....the russian video was ok for a cam,but nothing to write home about.It was dull
had a far bit of noise,colours were way off.
Now the audio ...in our opinion was and is really nice line
Work done,well first we synced this up to our line audio.....wasn't too bad,but there was a few parts so there might be some
slight oos and i mean like 100 either way ....and only for a short time.
Then we moved onto the video.....now first we made a .srt file for the begining as the subs were in russian.Then we filtered the video.
We made a script to remove the video noise,made it brighter,changed the colouring and also lowered the chroma aswell as a few other
things.

Anyway not a bad TS .....seen worse and at least we have decent audio for the R5
