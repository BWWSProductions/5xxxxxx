A live recording of Kraftwerk on the 1981 Computer World tour that I made at the Bristol Locarno on June 30th 1981. The recording is in mono and clear, if a little "thin" and there is a minimum of audience noise as I recorded it from the balcony abvoe the stage.
The tracks are fully tagged and it comes with my original artwork.
