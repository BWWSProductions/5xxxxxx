     Based on Andy McNab's memoir, Bravo Two Zero is the story of the eight-man
     SAS team who, during the Gulf War, were dropped behind enemy lines with
     orders to destroy Saddam's 'scud alley'. Unfortunately, within 24 hours,
     the team's radios were dead and they found themselves pursued by the Iraqi
     Army. Sergeant McNab, who commanded the top-secret mission, was one of the
     five who made it back from behind Iraqi lines, and his story is one of
     the most heartbreaking and thrilling of the Gulf War.
