,Erik_O,2010-11-14T19:30Z,Why do you upload an exe in the pictures category? It really makes me suspicious.
,magnetiseur72,2010-11-14T20:12Z,"Sorry for the exe but it's a screensaver. 
Where to put it ???"
,monkeyman114,2010-11-15T00:30Z,Nobody is stupid enough to actually install a screensaver they downloaded from TPB
,dobiebarns,2010-11-16T09:01Z,Works OK.  Nice up!
