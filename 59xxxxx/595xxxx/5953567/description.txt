Also known as "Itoshi no Kana".

From Solaris-SVU:

Though his name may mean good luck, Daikichi is far from lucky. Losing his home and his job, he narrowly avoids being homeless when he finds an old abandoned apartment building. But the apartment isn't nearly as abandoned as it first appeared, as it's being occupied by the ghost of a girl who committed suicide there many years prior. 

3 Volumes, .cbr format.

Unlike REC, this one is COMPLETE.

I highly recommend it, one of my favorites.

Guys SEED FOR A WHILE WHEN DOWNLOAD IS FINISHED, IT'S REALLY ANNOYING.

Also, please leave a comment, I'd really appreciate to know if it's working or if you have any complaints I could resolve regarding the torrent.
