I love the quality but VLC player is pausing while playing it on Win7 x64. "
,kithylin,2010-12-15T01:48Z,"@slick2011: Media Player Classic Home Cinema, make sure you get the 64-bit version.  No installing, extract, run exe, open file, enjoy.

significantly reduced cpu load on 64-bit operating system with 64-bit cpu.  1080p content is fairly heavy-hitting though, make sure you have at least a 2.6ghz dual core or 2ghz quad core or more."
