These are the first 8 books of the Guardians of Ga'Hoole Series (containing 15 books) from Kathryn Lasky in the form of audio books narrated by Pamela Garelick (these are all available ga'hoole audio books to date, the next are sceduled to release in march and april of 2011).

Ripped with ExactAudioCopy into MP3 format:
Mp3 ~112kbit/s variable bitrate, co-stereo, 44khz.

The content is seperated into chapters (one file per chapter),
and all files have ID3 metadata included, plus the original cover images in high quality.

I think this is the most complete collection
in the best quality available currently.

Please write comments if there are any errors (audio jitters, missing audio sections... The original audio was seperated into tracks of about 3 minutes each, and I found their number to be just too large so I combined the tracks into chapters)

Have fun,
Hironimo
