Food Party - Poopisode

(Season 2 Episode 8)

Thu is trying to turn her house into a gingerbread house by slathering it in raw gingerbread. Unfortunately a giant rat eats all the gingerbread in the middle of the night and leaves behind gingerbread turds on the kitchen floor. Inspired to cook, Thu makes delicious turd Âinspired food. The rat admits to eating the gingerbread and is sorry but denies leaving the turds so Thu and Satan set up a surveillance camera to catch the pooping culprit.
