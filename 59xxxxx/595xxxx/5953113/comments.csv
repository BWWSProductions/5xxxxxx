After ur return, u r still releasing movies like expendables and many crap. We want some good movies that u missed out during ur absent like Avatar , Inception.

People are still waiting for ur avatar and inception copy.

Sorry but this is truth. so avoid uploading new crap movies. Go 4 ur missing era. "

,yashsagar,2010-12-09T10:21Z,secretmyth plz upload the new AVATAR (special edition) in blu ray (1080p)
,bhobson333,2010-12-12T05:01Z,"The soundtrack drops out in minute 1:39 so you can't hear what's being said for the last few minutes of the movie.  

Grrrrrrr....."
,ok_dr,2010-12-15T22:25Z,"djmit at least make a simple search before showing your ingratitude, you'd see secretmyth has uploaded avatar months ago."
,otdrne,2010-12-19T14:57Z,Ok after watching the movie I have to say that the sound goes off for the last 5 min. Till then it's perfect quality.
,fernychild,2010-12-30T19:59Z,"warning: i got a copyright infringement notice from my ISP (Comcast) for this torrent, even with peerblock updated & running. "
,donaldinoduck,2011-01-22T09:41Z,"Would just like to confirm that the sound indeed completely goes ""off"" in the last 5 minutes or the ending of the movie as highlighted by bhobson333 and fernychild in the comments above :(

Too bad..as this was otherwise an excellent rip but because of the missing sound in the end I will have to delete this Release from Secretmyth and look for another one !!!"
,mega.gr,2011-02-05T19:32Z,"What I'm witnessing is that the sound track is a few seconds off the video throughout the entire movie. In the last five minutes, audio and video are totally messed up.  I am using ""BS Player""."
