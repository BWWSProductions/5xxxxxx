"Close Encounters of the Murderous Kind"

After a prominent astrophysicist's body is 
found in her car -- the victim of explosive 
decompression - Castle jokingly theorizes 
that perhaps she was killed in the vacuum 
of outer space. Yet as they delve deeper 
into the victim's life, they're confronted 
with evidence that keeps pointing them back 
to the impossible -- alien abduction. Lance 
Henrickson ("Millennium") stars as Benny 
Stryker, a well known alien abduction 
expert, and Lyle Lovett ("The Player") 
plays a mysterious government agent intent 
on shutting down the investigation.

Hard to fathom that some douches are still
preing nothing but subme6 hex crap
from shit sources. 

Enjoy :)
