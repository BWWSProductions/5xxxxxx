,kingau,2010-11-15T15:33Z,Seriously. Usually Russian cams are quite good at least a 7 in V quality. This one is really a 1-2 judging from the pics. I think I better wait for a better one instead of wasting my bandwidth

,D0gmeat,2010-11-16T04:37Z,"This movie is really bad, and that's not a reference to the quality of this rip. The movie tries to do too much and ends up doing nothing. Pointless character development, pointless subplots, pointless scenes, movie was just pointless. Looks like there should have been a videogame tie-in but the deal must have fallen through so they decided to turn it into a character piece.

Did I mention the movie was pointless?"
,pimpmobile,2010-11-16T05:27Z,holy crap the picture is horrible why would you upload this!
,some-young-guy,2010-11-16T15:37Z,"@DOg, dude you just ruined my expectations.  I thought this was gonna be like a War of the Wrolds, but you robbed my thunder. =("
