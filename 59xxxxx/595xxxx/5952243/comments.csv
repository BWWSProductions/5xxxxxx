C'mon, people, the man has put it here for you, and he deserves a few seconds to write ""Thank you!"" The more so as... you seem to appreciate the torrent, since you download and seed it - 79 seeds 44 peers at the moment of my downloading -!) Otherwise: good audio quality; good download speed - an average of 8.5 Mb/s for me! Keep up the good work, karl2802"
