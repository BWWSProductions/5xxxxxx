,enonumus,2012-03-19T10:57Z,"If you need 400MB movies because you're using a 300 Baud modem to connect to the internet, then stick with H.264 STANDARD-DEF movies.  Those will look BETTER than 720P movies ultra-compressed to 400-500MB which look like CRAP, unless it's an 80 minute movie with no action or camera pans.  

800MB is still too low and compromises a LOT of detail,  especially for a movie well over 2 hours like this one, but at least it's still enjoyable to watch.  Stick with 800MB-1GB movies if you're trying to produce extremely small 720P files with at least HALFWAY decent quality."
