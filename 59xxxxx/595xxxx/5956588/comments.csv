[V],globeplus,2010-11-15T08:19Z,"VERY IMPORTANT TO THE USERS OF THE EMULATOR :

IT LOOKS THAT WITH NO DOUBT THE 32 BIT VERSION IT IS BETTER TO PLAY THIS GAME , I REALLY DONÂ´T RECOMMEND THE 64 BITS EMULATOR VERSION , MY DEFINITIVE RECOMENDATION WITH ABSOLUTE NORMALITY IN EVERYTHING AND A FEW LEVELS ALREADY PLAYED :

USE THE rev6420-32 bits JUST LIKE IT IS , THE ONLY THING IS DEFINE THE KEYS OR THE GAMEPAD DEPENDING IN HOW YOU WANT TO PLAY , USE THE HTML PAGE INCLUDED ON THE FILE TO DOWNLOAD THIS ONE LATEST VERSION , ABSLOTLY WORKING PERFECTLY FOR THIS GAME !!!

THE 64 BITS HAVE MORE GLITCHES AND HEVE A BUG ON THE 3RD LEVEL , LOOKS LIKE THAT ."
[V],globeplus,2010-11-15T11:14Z,"Ok the new rev6421-64 bits it is ok too , in fact any of them are ok , just donÂ´t change configurations , the problems i get in 64 bits was my mistake but i am enough human to admit that , so my friendly users , for this game :

PERFECT USE OF THE EMULATOR 32 AND 64 BITS LATEST EMULATOR VERSIONS ; I HAVE A FEELING THAT THIS EMULATOR WILL BE GREAT TOO WHEN THE Wii 2 COMES OUT , HE ALREADY EMULATE THE WII TOYS AND IS IMPROVING ALL THE TIME , THE ADAPTATION FOR A POSSIBLE Wii 2 PROBABLY CANÂ´T BE THAT DIFFERENT FROM THE EMULATION FROM THE Wii 1 ... WELL WE HAVE TO WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPEN BUT THIS EMULATOR CERTAINLY HAVE A GREAT FUTURE NO DOUBT !!!"

[V],globeplus,2010-11-17T12:00Z,"STORY OF THIS FILE PART 1 :
===================

Hi everyone ... i , as a uploader i am getting my work stories and because my files are not only forme getting free more hard disk soacew but for the general users to , i think it is fair enough to share my work story about this file with the users .

I started the work absolutly happy with a new Sonic game with 3D action , in this case for the Wii , no PC version but working perfectly on the emulator and that said everything to me , i must work this game !!! Then i started carefully analising the possibilitys and of course the videos is the most important point for the work beside other smaller things that can have little touches , so i started the work on the videos : obgne by one very carefully and before upload the file , i can guarantee that this is true , i was many hours surrounding the audio of the videos after the work until i find in that period that the in-game videos of this Sonic game had 2 audio languages , not only one (english and japanese) ...
 (TO BE CONTINUED) "
[V],globeplus,2010-11-17T12:09Z,"STORY OF THIS FILE PART 2:
===================

and with the old nice tools that i had to work this type of videos , the best i can get was the japanese audio extracted but without working inside the game while the videos playing and after many tentatives on the matter to get , not only the japanese but the english audio too out of the videos  , i needed to quit : my avaukablke tools at that moment didnÂ´t gived me a shot to extract the english audio no matter what and then i udid the necessary work and i uploaded with nice picture , well synchronized english subtitles but unfornatly with the resignation about the the videos audio situation , just life of an uploader ...

After the upload , i get some free time then i tought to myself : GLOBE , donÂ´t quit !!! keep going insisting in finding a way out for the double audio languages videos of this type for the Wii games and with that getting more experience for future files with absolute perfect rips keeping inclusive amazingly the videos audio getting nice picture and sound and smaller sizes for really nice Wii games putting the general users of my files absolutly happy with my work in all the ways ...
(TO BE CONTINUED)"
[V],globeplus,2010-11-17T12:20Z,"STORY OF THIS FILE PART 3 :
=====================

So , i strated seraching everything possible and impossible (way of expression of course) on the net to get more tools that can possibly help me on the extraction of the english audio and : after 4 or 5 hours i get my first fantastic surprise : like for miracle i getted atool that wasnÂ´t for this tools console that did the work on the extraction and how ? wiith the english audio available in a disguised audio file that getted out like beeing undercovered , it was like this : i get the main audio in japanese anyway and with this surprising tool i getted too a smaller audio file in a not common normal audio format with i founded later the english audio in it !!! FANTASTIC !!! now finally after many search the english audio was extracted and in fron of me but then i get another real big problem : beside the inclusion of the audio on the video file the audio doesnÂ´t work and inside the game the videos still with only the video and subtitles and no audio !!! and this time i got afraid that i simply didnÂ´t get a way out because this type of videos files are worked with a codec getted by evaluation for companys making games or something like that and impossible to get on the net anywhere , so i needed to work a video file for this wii videos with the old nice tools finded here and there and used smartly as possible to get the work done !...
and my research restart and after many fails and many tentatives to get the audio working fine on the videos i finally got the miracle key to the sucess :
(TO BE CONTINUED)"
[V],globeplus,2010-11-17T12:30Z,"STORY OF THIS FILE PART 4 AND FINAL PART :
==============================

and what was this miracle key : was start thinking in work the audio of videos in the perspective of videos with double language , i explain better , after many failed tentatives in single audio with work inclusive that somehow maked sense , i stargt got the feeling that no matter what , with only 1 audio on the videos i simply didnÂ´t get anywhere no matter what , so i thinked now on the videos with double language and i used my old nice tools to create videos with double language for this type of video then i maked the 1st experience on the game and ... SUCESS !!! but strangely getting the japanese audio running on the video beside the fact that i gived the indication that the priority language was rthe english one , so i get surprised but happy because finally was audio running with the video , then i get a fantastic idea very creative and appropriate : swapping the english and japanese audio positions on the tool , putting the english audio in the position of the japanese , and ... COMPLETE SUCESS !!! because somehow the japanese indication on the videos was the priority beside i gived the orientation or not , so putting the english audio acting like the japanese kills the bull !!! Ok , my friendly i hope no one trying to kill me now because i spent 4 comments sharing this story with the users , i have to go now and future wii fiules with this type of videos i can do even vetter work , bye and HAPPY GAMING !!!"
[V],globeplus,2010-11-17T12:35Z,"To Jainmehul : use the included html page on the file and get the latest version for 32 or 64 bits , don´t change any configuration , just choose the keys or gamepad and that´s all then restart your computer just to get all the ram free to go to the game with nothing borring somehow , finally put the iso in a folder , browse that folder on the emulator , double click on the game and that´s it , you get the game running perfectly on the emulator , i can guarantee with works 100% with the best quality like in a real wii , you simply can believe me , so do my suggestions and good luck to you and happy gaming !!!"

[T],Distrance,2010-11-27T09:34Z,"What on earth are you going on about globeplus ? What work ? If you ripped this off from a Wii game you purchased, there's no '' work '' to be done to run it on an emulator.

Why the hell do you even use something lame as emulator, atleast buy the damn console if not the games ..."
[T],Distrance,2010-11-27T09:37Z,"And if I understood you correctly, you extracted ... japanese audio out of the game ? Why on earth would you do that ?

And additionally to someone who posted on the first page : Do not use RegionFrii or stuff like that. This isn't 2007, all current backup launchers have '' Force NTSC / PAL '' option when running off the Wii."
,Corwii,2011-09-10T04:56Z,It's nice to have people that's willing to share the wealth. Downloading at highest 1.5 Mbps. I have a core i3 so I will comment on how it runs. My Wii isn't modded.

,Elliander,2011-09-20T07:50Z,"This is a strange ISO. The correct size of a Wii ISO is 4,589,824 KB no matter what game it is (with the exception of scrubbed ISO files or .wbfs files which may be smaller). This file, however, is 2,277,799 KB. In the included instructions file it says he intentionally removed all the sound from the videos so even if it worked this would not be a good torrent. Not surprisingly, WBFS managers do not recognize this as a valid Wii file so you should probably skip this file completely if you plan to play on your Wii. While I have not tested it with an emulator to determine if it is fake or not I'm pretty sure there is no point in using an ISO that's missing content anyway. People need to stop seeding this torrent and let it die. "

,justincredible81,2012-04-08T18:13Z,"I downloaded this to play on Wii because other comments said you could. It does unrar to an iso but when I try to add it to imgburn it says ""invalid image format"" How do I burn this to play on Wii? "
,justincredible81,2012-04-08T19:17Z,"Ok I figured out how you play this on Wii. Even if you have no intention of playing the emulator you have to download the emulator. It sounds strange but you have to then load the iso then within Dolphin you choose ""decompress iso"" This will turn it into a burnable iso file using imgburn. 

It saved me 1.5 or 2 gbs downloading vs the other ones so it was worth it. "
