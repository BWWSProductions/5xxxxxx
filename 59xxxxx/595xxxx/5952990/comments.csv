[T],jwhitt62,2010-11-20T06:03Z,...and apparently so does the rest of the world...
,zdDog,2010-11-22T11:46Z,"@ jimreaper273...mmm freedom of speech...as long as the rest of the world agrees with you, ey? No wonder u like Bush...the rest of the world does not"
,burningrabbit,2010-11-23T02:41Z,"fuck Bush, that little pea-brained suckass..."
,Nortel77,2010-11-23T04:20Z,Burningrabbit: Go fuck yourself you fukin turd!
,sublimize,2010-11-30T01:43Z,"Ah yes, arguing politics on the internet, such a good use of one's time.  Anyone read/heard the book yet?  How was it?"
,the_lee,2010-12-17T21:26Z,"The book it's self is a great read.. Obiously if you don;t like Bush, then odds are you won't like the book cause you already have your mind made up. If your more openminded, then you will like it. All you bitching about Bush,, your boy Obama ain't doing so hot either..."
,eldiab13,2010-12-17T22:08Z,does this audiobook come with the companion coloring workbook ?
,CapitalistDog,2011-02-14T18:47Z,"In fact, it does not. This is only a small inconvenience, though. Simply contact the FBI, when you have completed the DL, and tell them you need a copy of the work book because your pirated copy didn't come with one. They'll get you set up.

Good Luck."
,antireligion,2011-06-03T17:33Z,"Bush isn't my favorite but the book was really good!

Thanks for the upload!"
