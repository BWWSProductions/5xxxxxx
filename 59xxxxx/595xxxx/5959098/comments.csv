Does anyone know?"

,PhilLesh12,2010-11-18T11:07Z,"Anyone who likes Weeds might like the BBC series, ""Ideal"" about a bunch of mancurians. (Manchester residents).  It makes fun of weed dealers, petty thieves, street urchins, people on the dole, etc blahdy etc.

I just discovered this and have watched 4 out of 6 seasons over the weekend, and every night this week.

Just do search on TPB for ""ideal""."
