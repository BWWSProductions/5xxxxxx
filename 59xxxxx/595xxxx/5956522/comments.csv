,Tatletz,2010-11-16T02:01Z,"Hi DeGun, thanks for the upload. I am having the same problem as already described. Can't find the password for this rar file, the text under the notepad PASSWORD=degun.txt dont work-well not for me. Rar files are generaly used for keygens as AV's often recognise them as trojans. It would be much appreciated if you could provide a single notepad with the password and instructions on it-plain and simple. Instead we are facing one rar file after another rar which on top of this is password protected! Are you trying to hide the secret to immortality mate!  "
,Tatletz,2010-11-16T08:58Z,"@redhat263=>Thanks mate, much appreciated-now it works!

@DeGun=>Thanks again for the upload, and please try to use plain info text in notepad instead of passworded rar's"
