Then Open The r11.reg File With Notepad

There U Will See The Installation DIrectory Will Be ""E:\\Two Worlds"" , Now U Have To Replace This With The Installtion Path Where U Have Extracted

For Example

D:\\Games\Two Worlds Rip , - It Cud Be Anything

what exactly do you mean?

half the sounds and video sounds are gone or are they half the quality?

please answer :)"

,cousland,2010-11-17T15:34Z,"hey.I installed the game.
edited the r11.reg file
tried playing the game
""game is not installed""

so I applied the ""game is not installed fix"" from your other torrent
tried the game and as soon as I see the ""two worlds II"" screen it says ""program has encountered an error""


I have an atlhon 5600+ and a radeon 4850 512mb and 2GB RAM.

my specs aren't good enough for this game? I think it can handle it so what's the problem?"
,JoeKKer,2010-11-17T16:44Z,"U Said U Edited The r11.reg And Then Applied The Patch ...DID U REMOVED THE CHANGES DONE BY ""r11.reg"" Before Applying The Patch ? If No Please Do  It So"
,cousland,2010-11-17T18:05Z,"hmm...it seems I cannot apply the patch.

when I run the game_not_installed_fix.bat file it says in the dos window:

""regedit is not recognized as an internal or external command,operable program or batch file""

using windows 7 32 bit ultimate.
tried running as admin and through the locked hidden admin account with same results.

tried renaming it to .reg (lol) but the registry editor can't import the values to the registry

and what do you mean with ""did you remove the changes done by r11.reg""? how can you delete registry entries?going into regedit and just deleting them?"
,JoeKKer,2010-11-17T21:00Z,"Yes ! Find The Name ""Two Worlds"" And Delete Its Value , Then Apply The Patch"
,cousland,2010-11-17T21:58Z,"nope,deleted the registry keys.
tried the patch again and the same error message came up when starting the game.

my guess is that the patch isn't applied correctly...
any ideas?"

I have tried everything to get it to work, and everytime the instalation stops at either 40% or 58%. 

I even downloaded it twice just to be sure. If ya got any idea of what might be causing this let me know. Best regards Saph"
,Saphyroth,2011-02-13T01:07Z,"I just managed to get the installation done to the very end without any problems.

I am now getting the ""Error: Game ins't installed properly"" msg as expected. I changed the .reg file to the correct path, ex. from the E:\\Two Worlds II ; to C:\Program Files (x86)\Two Worlds II. I checked the regedit to see if the values where applied correctly and they where.. But the I still get the same error msg. The batch file you created to fix the .reg file problem doesn't want to run.. Even when I followed the steps you mentioned to cousland. Any hints would be apreciated Joekkerr"

,kangler,2011-02-28T07:56Z,I was very pissed with this game originally for awhile... i tried this version and the reloaded version and both of their fixes and kept getting the game isnt installed properly.. but somehow i worked around by deleting registry entries by searching for the terms worlds and reality pump and deleted everyone of them i saw and it worked... my only thing now is that there are no voices... anyway to fix this?? it not too important but i am one that likes to hear the voices instead of read... im a lazy stoner... thx in advance if anyone can help
,kangler,2011-03-01T04:11Z,"also... if anyone knows why my videos in game are running at about 50% the speed then they should be plz help me... its not my comp (as in it being too weak of a system)... i can run the game in high settings and play it with average fps. The talking sequences are normal speed and fine (other than no voice as i stated in a previous post).  Thx Joekkerr for the rip and if anyone can help with either problems, it would be appreciated."
