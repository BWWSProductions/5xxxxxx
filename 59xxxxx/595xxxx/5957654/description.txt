"This is Triple Play 2001.  This has beentested on the following operating 
systems: Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP SP3.

File Size After Extraction: 576 MB


When it asks for the code that's on the back of the CD case, type the
following (without the quotation marks): "14103 BUZZ WEIR VISA STAR"

Use ImgBurn, Infrarecorder, etc to write this to a blank CD. An alternatve to 
doing that would be to use Daemon to create a virtual CD drive.

Note: When using XP, you were able to play the game, but not save the game,
even if compatibility mode was enabled. This led me to assume that the game
won't even work in Vista or 7.

Note: You need a 3D video card to play this. I was unable to test if fullly on
Windows 2000 because of my video card limitations."
