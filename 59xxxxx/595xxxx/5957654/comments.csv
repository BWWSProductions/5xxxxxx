It says it needs the correct CD and shuts down.  Makes it unusable and I get to toss a CD.  Verdict: Epic Fail.  If there's a way around this issue, I'd like to know :)"

Here is a link for the No-cd patch

Also, you will need to go into your Program Files and there is a folder called 3DSetup. Change the setting to ""Software.""

Run in compatibility mode if necessary and this should run just fine on Xp, though it crashes on Alt-Tab, so you kind of need to want to run only the software :(

Great Job! Will seed.
