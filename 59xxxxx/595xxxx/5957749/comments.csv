,pspcow,2010-11-16T03:53Z,"Yo, everyone chill the F$#@ down. C4EVA promised the new LT+ will be released before Christmas.  
The new LT+ will have real time checks for AP25, protecting you from it on Xbox Live, while effectively reading the game.  No ETA as of this time, but expect a release before Christmas.
All disc read errors will be fixed and you will be safe on Live.  Y'all should go grab Call of Duty Black Ops as it is non AP25 and should read on current ixtreme LT 1.0 and 1.1!!!
Peace out bitches!!"
