,grezgorz,2010-11-25T20:07Z,Well I was able to generate valid keys by running the keygen in an isolated VM. Hopefully someone with more knowledge than me can get a clean version of the keygen from this and post it. Not really any need to include the installer as that can be downloaded from the developer's site.

,ultamanl,2010-12-07T16:58Z,"Am i confused or.. this its Business Edition... and not Extreme Edition..

Anyway, i tried it on Extreme Edition which i downloaded from official site, the keygen doesnt work, any ideas?"

A+"
