Just to give you all fair warning, I will seeding out nearly 6GB of new stuff by the end of this evening (2weekends of F1 & MotoGP) and I only have a 2Mb upload limit - this will take some time! :("
,funji,2010-11-15T00:17Z,thanks
,anchit02,2010-11-15T01:49Z,Thank you so much! Hope you will be doing the same for the 2011 F1 season. I really appreciate you uploading all the races. Thanks again!
,secana77,2010-11-15T03:36Z,come on folks!! No seeders whatsoever now!! Your supposed to share! that's what this is all about! everyone should be seeding for at least 12 hours after download. I always do that with stuff like this
,mrjlr93,2010-11-15T04:01Z,Thanks TDMK1 Bring On 2011. In HD
,HCity,2010-11-15T04:04Z,"tdmk1 where are you??

I am so desperate to watch this race.  This has been the most exciting F1 championship season ever and I'm dying to see it finished through. 

The availability for it is currently only .068, so either something's gone wrong with your connection and no one received a full copy, or anyone with a full copy stopped seeding!

 I know it must be 3am in the morning there, but we are in need!

P.S., Thank you SO much for uploading quali, races, and forums so quickly.  I live in the US and have no other way to see it but through your torrents.  I could watch it on the speed channel with the most boring commentary ever and no pre-or-post talk, but I HATE their coverage and refuse to watch it.

Without Jake, DC, EJ, and Martin, F1 just isn't F1."
,io23,2010-11-15T05:23Z,"Well, I bet you're glad you made it back home THIS weekend!:D What a fantastic season! Thanx for EVERY SINGLE upload! Hope to see you next year!
