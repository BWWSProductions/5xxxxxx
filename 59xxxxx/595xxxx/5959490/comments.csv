Meaning that we can update how much we want and still be able to reset."
,some-young-guy,2010-11-16T18:52Z,"I make a product.  I sell a product for $X,XXX.00

I then discover that someone else made a product that tricks my product into thinking that you paid the $X,XXX.00 that I sell my product for.  I then come to find that this other product is being freely shared by peers on TPB et al.

The least I could do to keep my sales margin from being drastically deflated is adding the codes that this other product generates into the threat libraries and try to have other libraries also recognize this threat thus bringing back up my sales margin.

I'm not saying to be cautious, but recognize that you are desiring to cross the waters on a vessel.  If you you are thinking about complaining of the less then commendable service, then WALK THE FUCKIN PLANK!!!!!"

I usually trust your torrents but not this one.
Virustotal gives 12 positives on 43.

Instead of silly free online av scanners try a descent av scanner, use Sandboxie, learn abiout false positives, and report suspicious torrents at the right place.
"
[T],Spikkie,2010-11-18T11:07Z,"Hi Robbinghood,
Didn't wanna hurt you piratemate!
I know about false positives,
I do have sandboxie
I report real bad torrents and fake uploaders on suprbay.
but
I always tought virustotal was a reliable reference. I always control unknown small sized apps there and sometimes it finds malware that wasn't detected by mine (KIS). From my own experience I know that Kaspersky somtimes recognizes it only after running it an than starts to remove the malware. (while some unknown av already recognized it)
All by all bro, we both know that we're loyal members of this community and we don't have any profit by blaming eachother.
Best regards
and keep up the good work.

,venomhed,2010-12-21T18:35Z,"No longer works.

Windows 7, x64 Pro.

Runs fine after disabling self d and virus scanner. Trial options show, but still says 4 days left."
,kostadarjania,2011-01-03T13:47Z,"unsub_dk
because u have already installed kaspersky without crack you must uninstal if first, after restart run crack, you will see that there will appear new button called ""purge"", click it then close crack, start installing kaspersky, at the end of installation where you must activate trial license stop there, open crack, click ""extract"" and close crack, then in kaspersky window select trial and continiue as normal. after 30 days and everytime when you will need to reset trial you just disable self defence, exit kaspersky and reset with crack."
,dinodig,2011-02-08T03:18Z,Fantastic!!! From when did BOX take up Kaspersky? And I hope he has not dropped Norton...
[V],RobbingHood,2011-02-08T04:26Z,"@dinodig 

Since 2008 till now BOX is making trial resetters for almost all security software and some other software."

Do u know of anywhere i can get a webroot internet security essentials or complete torrent with a trial reset from box or a cracked 1???

,3plx,2011-02-14T02:55Z,"it doesn't allow me to extract, after i uninstalled/purged it"
,TheEmpathicEar,2011-02-23T04:28Z,"@RobbingHood

I am a little confused about usage of this. I have KAV 2011 installed v11.0.2.556.

When I execute the ""Trial Reset"", I see only ""Read Me"" and ""Exit"" buttons? How do I proceed?

@kostadarjania mentions something seems to indicate that you need to ""uninstall"" KAV, run the ""Trial Reset"", and then ""reinstall"" KAV??"
[V],RobbingHood,2011-02-26T06:47Z,"@TheEmpathicEar

Try first what ""kostadarjania"" wrote. "
,TheEmpathicEar,2011-03-02T01:33Z,"@kostadarjania
@RobbingHood

The reseter has a ""ReadMe"" that explains what to do also.

I followed all the instructions:

"">> When using the Kaspersky Trial Reset 2011 v3.3.1 the first time:
1. If installed, uninstall Kaspersky and restart the computer.
2. Run the KTR2011-v3.3.1, click [PURGE], and exit.
3. Install Kaspersky 2011.0.2.556 or PURE 9.1.0.124, but DO NOT activate yet!
4. Run the KTR2011-v3.3.1, click [EXTRACT], and exit. 
   >> Note: Step-4 [EXTRACT] is only required the first time! 
5. Now activate and use Kaspersky (as 30-days trial).""

[I disabled ""Self-Defense""]

I get the [PURGE] button, but NOT the [EXTRACT] button. So, I never see the [RESET] button either.

However, doing the uninstall/reinstall seems to get me a ""fresh"" 30 days trial. But, of course, this would be a ""bore"" to do every 30 days!

Any ideas? I disabled ""Self-Defense"" when I did not see the [EXTRACT] button, but it did make any difference..."
,TheEmpathicEar,2011-03-02T01:35Z,I'm doing all this on a WINXPPRO SP3 32-bit machine.
,TheEmpathicEar,2011-03-03T02:14Z,"UPDATE:
1. I did the ""Uninstall"" process again,  BUT did not select ""Complete Uninstall"" [or whatever] it said. I allowed Kaspersky to retain ""Application"" settings and nothing else.

2. I used the resetter and got the [EXTRACT] button this time around! [yeh!]

I have Comodo Firewall/Defense+ installed also. During this above process, I cancelled Comodo until I was finished with Kaspersky. Could this have anything to do with anything?"
,Killer Death,2011-03-04T16:15Z,"I also don't have the option to extract nor reset, but i tried the trial resetter v. 3.2.0 and that one gives me the reset option."
