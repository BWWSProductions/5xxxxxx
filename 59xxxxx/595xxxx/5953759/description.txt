Upon first listen, "Paramour" had an Emmylou Harris, "Wrecking Ball" feel to it---then I was to find out it was produced by Mark Howard, a Lanois prodigy. Ah-ha, so there you go.... 

Wistful, weeping guitar, deep rhythms, and rich vocals infuse the tracks on "Paramour." This is stirring, bucolic music that seeps inside and possesses you. While the mood remains a constant through-line, the feel varies: "Blue River" is bluesy and soulful; "The Ballad of Padre Miguel" has a Latin flavor; and "Rosa Marie" is deep and penetrating in its sensual, pleading story. 

"Paramour" pulls from various traditions, sounds, and influences (you'll hear a little bit of U2, a touch of Neil Young, some Dylan here and there, a bit of Emmylou, Chris Isaak and Old West and an occasional hue of P.J. Harvey) but DEADMAN has a sound and feel that is very much its own: at the same time ghostly and romantic; creating a dynamic, and complex feel, likening to an old western flick filmed in the middle of autumn, and taking a old horse down a lost highway.
