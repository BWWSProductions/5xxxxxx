Most copies of these bootlegs are done poorly. Many contain surface noise or the sound is blurry/dull due to the effects of noise removal.

Two years ago I created a torrent of my own personal ripps from these rare albums never before released on cd. Well I decided to go out and buy copies that were sealed and near mint, so that this second rip would be even better. I realized I didn't need to use any noise removal software because just the pure sound from the RIP was good enough.
