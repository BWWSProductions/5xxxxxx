The second album by Black Sabbath, released in 1970, has long attained classic
status. Paranoid not only changed the face of rock music, but also defined the sound
and style of heavy metal more than any other record in rock history. The result of a
magic chemistry which had been discovered between four English musicians, it put
Black Sabbath firmly on the road to world domination.

This programme tells the story behind the writing, recording and success of the album.
Despite vilification from the Christian and moral right and all the harsh criticism that
the music press could hurl at them, Paranoid catapulted Sabbath into the rock
stratosphere.

Using exclusive interviews, musical demonstration, archive footage and a return to the
multi-tracks with engineer Tom Allom, the film reveals how Ozzy Osbourne, Tony
Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward created their frighteningly dark, heavy and earshatteringly
loud sound.

Additional comments from Phil Alexander [MOJO & Kerrang! editor], Geoff Barton
[Classic Rock editor], Henry Rollins [writer/musician] and Jim Simpson [original
manager] add insight to the creation of this all-time classic.
