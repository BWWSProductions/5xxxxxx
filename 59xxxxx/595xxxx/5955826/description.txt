 The album is full of clever lyrics, interesting guitar licks, and fascinating vocals by Miller, who sounds a lot like Hank Williams Sr at times, is backed up by the soothing vocals of his wife, Tracee, and all backed by beautiful instrumentation. Pedal steel player Feeny and banjo artist Patch Boyle add a distinctly "country" vibe, while bass player Tracee and drummer Lisa Jannon keep the rhythm in check. 

All in all this is a wonderful album for anyone who is interested in the diversity that can be obtained when not limiting yourself to a label of rock and roll or country.
