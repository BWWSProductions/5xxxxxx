Recording information: 2005. Ensemble: The Kick Horns. Eric Clapton's first album of mostly original material since 2001, BACK HOME, as the title implies, finds the reveredguitarist/vocalist in a comfortable, confident setting. Here Clapton's signature blues-rock sound is the order of the day, as exemplified by the easy-going "Revolution," which riffs on the lyrics of the Beatles song of the same name, and conjures up the reggae-tinged vibe of EC's famous rendition of Bob Marley's "I Shot the Sheriff." Clapton's Beatles connection also pops up on a gentle cover of "Love Comes to Everyone" by his friend George Harrison. 

In addition to his longtime bandmates Doyle Bramhall II and Andy Fairweather Low   
(guitar), Nathan East (bass), and Steve Gadd (drums), who have an almost telepathic
connection with Clapton, BACK HOME features contributions by John Mayer, Billy     
Preston, Steve Winwood, Vince Gill, and Robert Randolph. However, these artists never distract from Clapton, who is clearly playing to the strengths of his more 
pop-oriented side
