,rosenpower,2010-11-13T04:14Z,Does this work? When do we get an online crack ? or is it to hard to get with all these protectiong stuff ? I whould like to play online rather then play singleplayer. 
,EvilOnee,2010-11-13T04:53Z,Idk if it works i dont use torrents from people who arn`t vip or trusted i just wait till theres more comments and the online i think is pretty hard to do but cant wait 
,Jangles90,2010-11-13T06:53Z,Works but game is still hella laggy even with the best systems.  Need a NEW CrackFIX PLZ that doesn't make game extremely laggy!
,Raa11,2010-11-13T06:55Z,The reloaded fix doesn't work. Wait for another one!
,Dimmis80,2010-11-13T08:40Z,So this crack don't make the diference with the games problems..!?Like laging and freezing.!??For me the problem is that the game is randomly freezing.Anyways i will give it a try and post later.
,Dimmis80,2010-11-13T08:53Z,Oh yeah very nice fix.!!!With this crackfix i got Black screen and the game don't load at all.!!At least before i could play the game.My opinion don't download this does dont work.!!:(

,noddsta,2010-11-13T16:51Z,works but still crashes when u try exit the game
,Andy-Camel,2010-11-13T16:57Z,"@OnlySolus, did it fix the stuttering and lag in SP?
Folks on the steam forums said that a temp patch has been released and it improves the lag. 
Is this the one?"
,iffens,2010-11-13T17:53Z,"not working,just black screen and thats it."
