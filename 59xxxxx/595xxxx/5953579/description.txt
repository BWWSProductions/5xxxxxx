
Release Notes

We decided to release this crackfix, because instead of removing the checks
that the protected executable does, Skidrow left all checks that steam
does in place. Since steam did a very poor job of protecting this game,
there are some serious performance issues on less powerful computers. On
one of our systems the difference in FPS was approximately 50%. Because
the game has a frame limiter in place, it is best noticeable on less
powerful PCs.

As a bonus we made it possible to play in zombie mode with our crack.
SKIDROW also released an enabler for this, but their crack crashes when
going back to menu.
