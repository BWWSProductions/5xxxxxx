Various Artists
[DVSP-0060] 2010
MP3 LAME V2 (~192)
Ambient, House, Trance

Published by Diverse System, one of my favorite JCore labels. They tend to produce the more complex, original, sophistimicated albums. This is another example of that. This album leans more towards blending light trance, ambient, and house. Pretty chill, the whole album is nice, enjoy.
