Hardline Entertainment band MUSKET released a special Holidays single entitled "Christmas Blow" on November 30th, 2009 -- in advance of their full-length sophomore album due out this Fall 2010.  The alternative rock format song mixes comedic lyrics with acoustic melodies and joyful harmonies to deliver an intoxicating jingle sure to put everyone in the Holiday spirit.  Recorded at Hardline Studios in Hermosa Beach, CA, and mixed by Mike Sutherland (Slightly Stoopid), the radio-friendly â€œChristmas Blowâ€ contains mild sexual innuendos and an addictive chorus guaranteed to be stuck in your head for days.
