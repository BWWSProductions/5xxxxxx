[V],twentyforty,2010-11-12T18:36Z,"@htctouch: By same logic this torrent would have half of the files - but it wasn't so.
As I said: Keep your shows ""in life"" by voting and sayin' Thanks. At the end of the day - that would shape my opinions and intentions.

Any asking/bitching ""where-is-that-or-this"" would be treated negatively.

I stated that loud and clear:

""Do NOT request inclusion of TV shows in my schedule; that's my call. The removal of some show depends on many factors...""."
