,cslowe,2010-12-20T11:46Z,"Thanks, nice to have the original audio :)"
,S111or,2010-12-22T15:55Z,"Amazing quality, on first hand, since no other good quality and original audio has been avaliable on the usual good torrent's spot.
Just a pity the file couldn't get smaller. But the DTS audio alone is way heavy itself.

Merci bien."
