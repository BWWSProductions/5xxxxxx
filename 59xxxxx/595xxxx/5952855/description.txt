Publisher's Summary
Over 20 years ago Diane Francis, in her revelatory best seller Controlling Interest, revealed the startling fact that one-third of Canada's wealth was controlled by just 32 families and five conglomerates. Has the concentration of power increased in the ensuing decades?

Media coverage would lead us to believe so, but Francis disagrees. Today, the balance has shifted: only half the families cited 20 years ago and only one of the five conglomerates remain major players. The old boys' network of risk-averse investors has been replaced by daring Canadian innovators, many of them self-made.

Who Owns Canada Now demonstrates that Canada is currently led by business moguls who offer innovative policies and a new vision for the country. Through incisive analysis and exclusive interviews, Francis reveals our country's most powerful players in the most important business topic of the year.
