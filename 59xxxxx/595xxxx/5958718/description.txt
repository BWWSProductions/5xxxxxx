    A con man inherits a gold mine. Knowing that his family are even         
    bigger con artists than he is, he assumes the mine is worthless, and     
    teams up with a partner in a scheme to unload it on some unsuspecting    
    chumps. However, the other members of his family discover that the       
    gold mine is actually worth a lot of money, and they set out to take     
    it from him before he realizes what he has.
