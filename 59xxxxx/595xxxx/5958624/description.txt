Pilot :
He was a writer. It seemed to him that he wrote about the future, but it really was about the past. In his novel, a mysterious train was leaving from time to time by the year 2046. All those who chose to do it there for one reason ... wanted to regain lost memories. No one was sure if this is true, because no one else there did not come back - no one except one person. He was there. He decided to return. He wanted to change.
