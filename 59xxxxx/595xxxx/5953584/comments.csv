This is too pixilezed. The video image is completely unwatchable.
Regarding the audio the same thing. The sound itâ€™s too high and many times imperceptible.
Nice try, but I donÂ´t recommend the download. Wait for a real good rip.
Video: 5, Audio: 6, Movie: ? (I couldnâ€™t watch it in this quality)."
,evenspol,2010-11-19T18:06Z,Come on i just watched the sample. It is pretty watchable. not any great quality but better then an average TS.

,0skippy0,2010-12-04T02:22Z,"quality is good not to pixalated and the audio is good, can't expect blue ray quality from a 700mb DVD rip, quality of this torrent is still good though!

Please comment if you have downloaded so above comments from other people can be ignored."
,libely,2010-12-04T09:22Z,What's up with you guys?Quality is great!At least on my computer!

,spain00,2010-12-25T14:58Z,dont even worry about the quality of the movie.  I watched a good version but it cant save the horrible train wreck this movie is...   it was so so so so boring.. nothing much happens and you dont care at all about the characters or what happens to them
,xXShadow117Xx,2010-12-28T01:18Z,lol i see some saying it was ok some that it was horrible. actual fact is that it blows all the noobs that rock limewire pro that just found out about the bay are the ones saying its good the veterans know what were talking about V=shit A=crap
,camo12345,2011-01-15T22:34Z,"Limewire is the worst, stopped using that years ago! Too many viruses coming through.

Anyway, on the subject of quality... it's ok, not the best, certainly not DVD quality, but not Cam quality either. 

As for the movie... if you have the time then watch it, i've seen worse movies."
