Well... it looks wrong to me anyway.

It seems the BluRay had a 2.35 aspect ratio while this MP4 is 2.22, or 1280x576. It's an easy fix to run it through MKVToolnix if you don't mind remuxing it as an MKV, just change the display aspect ratio to 2.35 and it's done. Or you can set the display dimensions as 1354x576, or 1280x544, depending which way you want to resize it.... it's all different ways to achieve the same thing and the picture won't look stretched any more.
If you don't like MKVs, YAMB will probably do the same thing while remuxing the audio and video into a new MP4."
