It is amazing REAL 1080 in only 1GB!!
How the fuck did you do that mate?
PLEASE tell me what encoder you are using to do that!
I will be downloading all of your movies lol"
[V],Zen_Bud,2010-12-13T09:02Z,"@spindeln----Hahahahah

THIS is a real Matroska container AND a true x264 codex!!

I think you don´t understand this ""!

If you want another format fix it then instead of stupid complain. "

,Thundernail,2011-01-18T23:42Z,"I can't even describe it. I mean, first of the download speed. This is the first time I have ever read MB on the Down Speed. I almost cried because the max I have got on any other torrents is 700 mb. 

Then the video, FUCK. Why the hell download 4GB 720p movies when you can get this?
V: 10

x264 is the future, today!"

,TuNNix,2011-04-21T11:59Z,"Downloading to see what all the fuss is about. 
If the quality is truly there, I'll bookmark your page Zen_Bud, I'm tired of waiting a week for a 10gb 1080p file to download! :P"
,TuNNix,2011-04-21T16:41Z,"It's NOT perfect quality when compared to larger files, but at the same time it's 100% worth it. The quality is better than 720p, and it took 15 minutes max to download.
Make sure to seed!"
