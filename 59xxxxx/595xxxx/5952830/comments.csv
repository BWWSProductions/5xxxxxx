,skillet92,2010-11-13T07:26Z,"Thanks alot for this one!!!
Waiting For Last Airbender too!! :) ( No Hurries But,take your time )"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-13T08:08Z,"@ALL: Thanks.

@noxiebhoy: As many of my ""regulars"" know, for years I have declined any type of live shows/events - on some repeated requests I even encoded just once to prove what I knew for decade:
""Low bitrate encoding is proven disaster for any type of live shows"".
Even encoding of singing competitions has ratio of success 4:1 ( do 5 - wipe my ass with 4 after the encoding). I cannot do that, I am sorry.

@punk67: Sanctuary - yes, as always... but without entering the schedule. Schedule is a statement: ""I'll do that no matter what"" or announcement that I have obtained the sources. It isn't so easy for all shows, hence my schedule."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-13T08:31Z,"@skillet92: Last Airbender was encoded on same day, upped on server same night and now is sitting there waiting to be released. Currently, one my  two servers is down, and TV packs have priority. So - as soon as possible."
,punk67,2010-11-13T08:53Z,Cheers twentyforty reguarding sanctuary info!also what is wrong with you people that keep asking for requests when it clearly says requests frozen?twentyforty always honours reputests according to his rules in my experience when there not frozen so give the guy a break please!theres plenty of other fine twentforty uploads to enjoy whilst your waiting for requests to be unfrozen!please have a bit of consideration and respect!thanks for everything twentyforty!
,skillet92,2010-11-13T09:48Z,"i am in no hurry!
i have sorcerers apprentice to seed yet!
and TV pack Nov.11 is done seeding Abt 1:5 ratio!
will seed after movie download is oveR!
Take your time!"
,shaaani,2010-11-13T11:08Z,"@20-40- will u be doing Avatar Extended version ???? 

sorry for repeating just need ur comment"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-13T13:00Z,"@shaaani: It's 2h58 (extended by 16 minutes) version and therefore - unsuitable for small-size encode - even in frame-format above the last one I already have encoded. FYI, I've encoded Avatar in FIVE versions so far and BluRay one was the last one from me.

Also (in my opinion) Avatar is over-hyped mediocre movie (I seen at least dozen better movies in 2009 alone) which separates from most of the baddies only by MadMen like propaganda and -

biggest amount of money  producers or director have spent in tracking down, ""hunt&kill"" Internet and P2P.

I am mad at myself for even touching the product of sick minds who drove this fucking world in present mess - just because of endless greed and unstoppable hunger for money.

My whole country needs 25 years to get same revenue Avatar generated in one.

Is it unfair?  I  don't think so - because HollyBolly gets money from the same stupid bunch we call - the people."
