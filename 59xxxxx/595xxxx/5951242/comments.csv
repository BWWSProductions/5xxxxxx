[V],Maherz,2010-11-23T06:24Z,"You can't do that with this ISO.
You need an original Windows XP SP3 ISO without any modifications."

[V],Maherz,2010-12-09T17:01Z,"@tejay4ever
You don't need a CD key. It's already included."
,AnTrAx92,2010-12-11T23:26Z,Tested and working 100%. No CD Key or Activation required. Microsoft genuine validation passed. Auto updates working. All updates 'till November installed. Only Windows messenger and MSN Explorer removed. Nothing else removed or added. For me the best Windows XP I could find. Thank you very much dude. You rock. ;)
[V],Maherz,2010-12-19T17:42Z,"@AnTrAx92
Anytime ;)"
,shahuk,2011-01-10T10:31Z,"it require key, not going further without key."
,shahuk,2011-01-10T10:32Z,it needs cd key. not working further without key.
[V],Maherz,2011-01-13T08:08Z,"@shahuk
It does not require a key.
It's asking you for one because you're installing on mac parallels or vmware, anyway, use this key:
MR49R-DRJXX-M6PX2-V96BF-8CKBJ
Good luck."
