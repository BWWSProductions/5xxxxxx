                    The New Me.                              
                    Miranda isn't your average girly girl. At 6 ft  
                    1, Miranda gets called 'sir' once too often,  
                    much to the amusement of her childhood friend  
                    Stevie, who manages Miranda's joke shop. In a  
                    hilarious attempt to get over Gary, Miranda  
                    tries to reinvent herself.
