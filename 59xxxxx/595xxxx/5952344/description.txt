Episode begins with Michael Westen in what may appear as a coma or some unconciousness state, but heÂ´s the one narrating in off. Fiona and Sam are alongside him in the bedside. Cut to a scene of Fiona watching Michael unconcious and saying: â€œItÂ´s been three days alreadyâ€, and in a very Fionalike way she kicks him, and Michael regains conciousness. Jesse comes to visit Michael in the hospital where heÂ´s in a wheelchair. Jesse and Michael speaking to each other and back together to the scheming and planning, but they still need to regain the trust in each other. Especially Jesse, who does not trust Michael after what happened. MichaelÂ´s mom visits him at the hospital and she wants him to move in with her so she â€œcan take care of his boyâ€. A sudden rush and a building exploding can be seen in a TV in the back and Sam tells him what happened, apparently a gas leak. Alicia Renson meets Michael and Sam, and tells them the story about her and her brother, turning her into â€œThe Clientâ€.
