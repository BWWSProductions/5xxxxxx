2. Launched 'AC2 Launcher'.
3. Got asked if Python should accept incoming traffic (or something like that).
4. Answered yes.
5. Got to a screen saying 'Please Log In'
6. Tried 'Register now'
7. Signed up with username, real email and real birth date.
8. Got a cryptic message that 'an Internet connection is needed to play AC'. 
9. Gave up."
[T],Apokarteron,2010-11-14T21:00Z,When the log in screen appears (presuming that you've run the cracked launcher first) just log in with any username and password you want.  Type keys at random - as long as the password is over six characters long.
,gogubbe213,2010-11-14T22:34Z,Thanks! That worked great.

,lalala220,2010-11-22T14:11Z,"Where can I find my saved game? I'm tired of the lagging so I'm gonna buy the original (really cheap, only 15 bucks) so it won't lag too much. I think. ANYWAY. Is there a way to move your save file? If so where can I find it? Or will I have to play again? I don't mind playing again though, really. I've always wanted to try finishing the game with just the leather greaves and some UBER powerful weapons."

,lolWestCoastlol,2011-10-14T21:29Z,"It actually works.

Here's what you do:
1. Download game http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5880449/ 
2. Download the crack
3. Install the game
4. Place your crack anywhere on your drive
5. Run the crack
6. When log in page appears insert a username that you like and insert a password 6 characters long and atleast 1 letter and 1 number.
7. Game starts etc etc.
8. Make sure you use same log in data that you've used the first time to retrieve your last game saves.
9. Make sure you do only like one mission, profie gets saved and then quit the application. Restart your mac and start the game again with the same log in data. Just so if you did something wrong you don't get angry for losing a long gameplay :P
10. Enjoy the game."

Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 3000 384MB vram OR AMD Radeon HD 6770m 1gb vram (I have 2 graphics card I can choose which one I want to use, preferably the AMD because it's far superior, but if it's not compatible and I have to use the Intel 3000 card thats fine, I'm not to hung up on graphics settings so long as it doesn't lag)

Thanks"
