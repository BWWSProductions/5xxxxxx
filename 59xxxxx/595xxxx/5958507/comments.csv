,pickled_egg,2010-11-16T02:40Z,"The game has been shipped to suppliers & many stores so anyone working in those places can get it earlier than release.
Plus it is on sale now in stores across America

I got my Pal Version this morning from local video shop (Mate works there & they got em today) but I don't have a drive in PC to be able to copy original disc's..... Sorry :("

,pspcow,2010-11-16T03:55Z,"Yo, I got news for y'all. C4EVA promised the new LT+ will be released before Christmas.
The new LT+ will have real time checks for AP25, protecting you from it on Xbox Live, while effectively reading the game. No ETA as of this time, but expect a release before Christmas.
All disc read errors will be fixed and you will be safe on Live. Y'all should go grab Call of Duty Black Ops as it is non AP25 and should read on current ixtreme LT 1.0 and 1.1!!!
Peace out bitches!! "

,Mondoman22,2010-11-26T18:11Z,"Hey All,
   Downloaded this game... You have got to make
sure you patch this with the latest abgx 360
and make sure you download all of the stealth
iso's and put them in your abgx stealth file folders as this is an AP.25 game... Which if you do not patch it properly it will not work and will send a flag to the good people ""Microfucks"" and they will ban your xbox from live.... The game
works excellent my appreciation to the uploader
Aitb has been here since i came here years ago
and love his uploads... Thank you bro... You are
one of the best... The game works flawless... I have a Benq drive in my old 2006 xbox and the
game performs as promised... The upload is a 
10 the game, Well i rate it a 5 it is the same old
same old... and a police force with a bugatti Veyron?!?!??!?!?! Come on Sheesh thats a 
stretch..... Anyways Great game and make sure
you all patch this thing properly....

    Have a good one!

,DETgamer313,2011-01-28T21:46Z,"This game downloaded just fine but out of all the games I downloaded & burnt so far this is this only one where it asks for a ""console update"" in order for it to be playable. Will this do any harm to my xbox 360 b/c it has been modded!? I recently had my xbox modded so it's the latest firmware. Is this safe to play. I don't have xbox Live either so I'm not worried about getting banned or anything like that. Please respond whenever you get a second. THANKS!"
