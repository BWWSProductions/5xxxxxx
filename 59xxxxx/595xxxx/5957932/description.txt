'Obsession' is the third album from 2005 X-Factor winner Shayne Ward and comes some three years after the album 'Breathless'. Working with some of the pop world's biggest producers including Darkchild (Lady Gaga, Pussycat Dolls) and Savan Kotecha (Usher,Spears) the album sees Ward opt for a classic mix of slick R&B and pop. The lead single 'Gotta Be Somebody' is also included.
