                    young woman with learning difficulties, lives  
                    in sheltered housing. She thinks that if she is  
                    good, she will be able to move back in with her  
                    mum Treena. Treena, however, is starting a new  
                    life with boyfriend Bob and his daughter,  
                    Stacey. When Darleen goes to see her friend
