Desc: The MPC Editor allows you to create program 
files on your PC. You can adjust various settings, 
such as mute groups, mixer settings, tuning, resonance,
filter and most of the settings that are available. It 
allows you to assign samples to particular pads by 
dragging and dropping the sample files from the sample 
list to the pads. When you are done creating your 
application, you can either save your program or export
to drive of your choice. This application creates and 
saves everything as files in which you save to disk and
then load from disk on the MPC2000, MPC2000XL, MPC3000 
or MPC60 with OS3.1
