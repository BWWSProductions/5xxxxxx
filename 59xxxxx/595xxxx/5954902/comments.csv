,Princesses,2010-11-18T03:01Z,"Good Movie, Loved It! Quality is 9 of 10! Oh & This Is The Entire Movie!"
,biggblack86,2010-12-01T04:38Z,"DAMN SURE isnt a 9/10.

more like a high five. but i guess its watchable. "
,TheZexter,2010-12-07T19:14Z,Does this copy have the flickering through out the entire film?
,TheZexter,2010-12-07T20:31Z,"Just got done with the DL. This is the best cam I've seen of this movie so far. It doesn't have that annoying flickering through out the entire film either!

A/8.5
V/7

The video is as good as old school vhs. Not too bad at all man. Well done!"
,suz2000,2010-12-07T21:37Z,@Princesses- Quality is a 9/10.....wow is that a joke!!!??? This torrent is definately NOT WATCHABLE! The movie is not centered and the auto plays in the background. To make matters worse you see people talking in front of the screen. I must say this torrent is a waste of 1.72 gb! From an honest critic..dont download this torrent wait for something better to be posted. Its soo horrible to see how many people lie on this site in regard to quality of the torrents being downloaded! Not ethical!

Have you seen the other uploads? Because I sure as hell have. This is the best I've seen thus far. While it's a little annoying at times. I think you are over exaggerating a bit. However, I do agree thats it's not a 9/10!"
,Princesses,2010-12-09T17:15Z,@suz2000 Yes 9 Out Of 10! Not A Joke And Definitely The Best Of Any Other Versions!!!
