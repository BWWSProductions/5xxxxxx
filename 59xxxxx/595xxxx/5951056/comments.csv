,MrMouthy,2010-11-17T00:21Z,"So tempted to download, shame its probably a trans-code of 128kbps like all your other shit though..."

Peace & SEED!!!"
,trini_bwoi,2010-11-19T07:03Z,"This shit is so fake, you just converted the songs from the DOH release to a higher bitrate which made it sound worse, and added the leaked version of See Me Now from months ago because Big Sean isn't even on it."
,Jahorse,2010-11-20T00:50Z,quality ain't great... transcoded up to look like higher bitrate like lots of other nofs releases
,suss2it,2010-11-20T09:04Z,"You guys didn't rip this. You took another group's leak and transcoded it to higher bitrate, which incidentally lowers the quality. Like that one dude said you don't even have the right ""See Me Now"" on here."
[V],jainmehul,2010-11-22T06:50Z,"rightly said everyone...
transcode from DOH release"
,MrMouthy,2010-11-22T20:09Z,"Lol, I just don't get you nos, you have a lot of trust respect on TBP and instead of using it to promote quality torrents you upload trans-coded shit.

It's just worse for EVERYONE. I used to download all your stuff until I realised it was shit, recently went through my music collection deleting your stuff (identifiable by your annoying copyrights) and replacing it with QUALITY shizzle."
[V],nos1977,2010-11-23T02:19Z,"Well... Well... free music has lots of comments... 
IF YOU DO NOT LIKE... DONT DOWNLOAD ...
Some will like some will not... 

Peace..."
,NotEnoughTime,2010-11-23T02:49Z,"I appreciate the torrent and all but protip for next time: Fix the ID tags.
