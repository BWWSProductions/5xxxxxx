,silent69,2010-11-13T05:46Z,"But i really doubt that this game is wave 8 or 9 !This game went gold long before the final kinect dashboard was finalize and  released so with will probably still be wave 6 and will not have the kinect dashboard on disc!Can anyone confirm the wave,and if the kinect dashboard is included?If it is can it be removed using wave patcher or booted using DISC BOOT??"
,danny_w,2010-11-13T05:51Z,"all i did to get the new kinect dashboard , with out getting banned ,  is download a kinect game ie fighters uncaged , unplug your wifi adapter or ethernet cable and update ,its microsoft that bans ,not the other game designers im still on lite touch ,only down side you can play live for a while . i hope that helps guys ."

I HAVE THE SAME QUESTION"
,manowx28,2010-11-13T08:09Z,"Well it seems old sammy drives and hitachi wil run ap2.5 games, samsung wont do ap25, it will be skipped.

but if you spoof a liteon to sammy they will detect drive change..

Damn hope LT+ comes out soon"
,legendsof420,2010-11-13T08:12Z,"No this game wont boot with activation disc. When you put it in it asks if you want to update, if no then you cant play. If yes you can download it to xbox hd but sadly you cant play it, its says that the disc is unreadable. So right now i dont think we can play this game. "
,manowx28,2010-11-13T09:56Z,"@sylar12

the thing is  007:bloodstone don't have ap2.5 (anti piracy) protection ac2 does, in combination with the new dasboard.

the dvd will give error like unable to read disk 

i think from now most games will come with this protection.

better run all new games trough abgx 1.03  to check if you spot ap2.5

,sadspam,2010-11-13T10:18Z,Doesn't work. Same problem as those who posted before me. I have a feeling I just wasted a DVD. Others should take heed and save their DVD's because I don't think this is gonna work unless they mod the contents of the disk/release one that doesn't give the unreadable disk error.

because the update goes straight inside the nand of the xbox.

btw I have a hitachi drive. So. that means it didn't work with hitachi drive but just samsung or either that I messed it up when I update the dashboard with the BETA version which I pretty much think its not the issue as I can still play Fable 3 and Blackops. 

And b4 I update it the disc still reads the AC:B to update it to kinect."
,kddin85,2010-11-13T14:48Z,I got Hitachi drive. Fable 3/Blackops works fine after I update dashboard to kinect BETA but AC:B won't be recognise when I try playing it. But it detects it as AC:B
,Chemognoza,2010-11-13T15:24Z,"@silent69
1. ABGX 1.0.3. says it's WAVE 8/9
2. Latest dashboard but not Kinect dashboard?! Kinect is the latest. Anyways, I tried it out on two dashboards (Kinect and previous one) aaaaaaaaaand...FUCK-O! Dashboard doesn't have to do with anything because AP25 (Anti Piracy 2.5) is ON THE DISC ITSELF. So, there are two ways to play this game: 
#1 Buy retail (original copy)
#2 Flash your drive with LT+ firmware (some say it will come out next month, others say it'll be released in Jan/Feb 2011) 
I dunno about this method that manowx28 (his comment is on the bottom of this page) mentioned but changing drives to some 2006 samsung with LiteOn keygen and so on is too much for me...to most of us probably. Conclusion: Watch how you sit Mates cuz' it looks like MS just fucked us in our asses."

no no,not a keygen  i just  used the drive key from my liteon and injected in sammy drive..but  it's quite a bitch to do soo lol

anyway..i just see this as a temporary solution  because  the drive is dusty as hell..and have to clean teh lens all the time..

finger crossed ppl  that LT+ comes out  soooon,cause

C4eva  mentiond that  they can detect drive swapping...i would care less cause i'm not soo into online gaming:P"
,silent69,2010-11-13T17:09Z,"@Chemognoza

The AP2.5 is not on the disc!Its only on the kinect dashboard!The only reason you cant play ACB on the old dashboard is because the ACB  disc haves the kinect dashboard on it, that wave 9!An ACB dont run on the new kinect dashboard because of AP2.5 ( you can still install it on the HDD but can't played)!So there two diferent reasons,one for not boot on the 9155 dashbord ( The wave 9-kinect dashboard ) and another reason for not boot on kinect dashboard (the AP2.5 ).!"
,silent69,2010-11-13T17:17Z,"@Chemognoza

AP2.5 is  on the disc itself but the checks are made from the kinect dashboard!The only reason you cant play ACB on the 9155 dashbord is due to the Wave 9 thats related to the kinect dashboard thats on the disc!Since you cant extract kinect dashboard files from the disc,the game wont boot on 9155 dashbord!"
,manowx28,2010-11-13T18:04Z,"@silent69

true,ass creed brotherhood,fable 3  will work on older dashboard

and the check is on the disk and the kinect dasboard triggers it

older sammy/hitachi drives didn't support AP2.5
that's why  you can boot the ap2.5 with those drives...however no one is safe playing any game online with the new dash  LT or not.

everyone who have the new dash should not go online because MS have some tricks up their sleeves

,cryogen,2010-11-20T20:26Z,"Ok for all who are complaining about this game not working.

Currently the game only works with the ixtreme LT firmware furthermore the game only works on the old Samsung drives, the reason for this is because the Samsung drive cannot actually use the AP2.5 patch that comes with the kinect which comes with all new games. 

I know this for a fact because well I did alot of research and I have a samsung drive and as of right now I am 9.67% into syncronization in the game. for other drives you are just gonna have to wait it out till the people who make the xtreme firmwares update the new firmware to LT+ which will bypass the AP2.5 restriction.

 Also if you install the Kinect dashboard and get the no disc error and you log into xbox live you pretty much just plagged your console/profile as using a burned disc and all your gamerscore is gone.

I will check back regularly to help with questions. I just registered a account to make this post.

 I guess if this form uses PM's if you have any problems or would like some questions directly anwsered I will take PM's on this issue as well."
,cryogen,2010-11-20T20:28Z,Ohh Also it has been said the new LT+ firmware for drives should be delivered on this end before christmas so hopefully they hold true to that.
,Haluwasa,2010-11-20T21:36Z,"i dont know much about this stuff but ive did my usual download patch to wave 2 then play and this is the first game that gave me the Unreadable disk error.... soo i would go for it guys. plus the 360 wave patcher said ""unknown wave do you still want to patch to wave 2?"" so that worried me and it didnt work..."
,berloga,2010-11-21T00:18Z,"Oh my big SH*&$ is done!

There is a way to play the game even with firmware revision 78/79, just follow these instructions and it works! I'm playing the game right now without any problems. Note: You need IXtreme 1.51 or it won't work (I assume most people have it already though).

Download new dash (SystemUpdate12611) unzip to usb flash drive ,put it in your 360 & power on.
It would seem the one on the ACBdisk is not full,once youve installed the one from memory stick skip the tutorial & try your assassins creed disk again.
It does now work

( On my Lite On flashed with LT+ 1.1 )

*I downloaded and installed agbx360 1.0.5 (YOU WILL NEED 1.0.5, no earlier version)
*Select the iso you have unpacked 
*Under the ""AutoFix"", set threshold to Level 3.
*Let agbx360 do it's thing (thank Seacrest)
*Burn with Imgburn 2.5.4 at 2x, using Verbatim DVD+R DL disc.

The game will probably ask you to do a required update, I did the update and it worked for me ( older games work too ) but do this at your own risk. If you are on a Arcade or Core Xbox use any USB drive as storage device.

This is the first time i have downloaded a 360 game so i went on you tube done a little research. I have a modded xbox 360 Hitatchi drive plays coppied games no problems. I downloaded the file extracted it applied the new patch with ppf-o-matic3 to get away from the ap25. I then ran it in abgx360 level 3 showing no faults atall. I then burned the iso in ImgBurn at 2.4x on layer 1913760 using Verbatim dual layer dvd's. When i put the game into the 360 i get a play game with no picture of acb when i click play it says the disc is unreadable. I have updated the xbox 360 to the new version via flash drive but still no joy. Any ideas ? Much appreciated!"

Check for anydvd style data corruption...Then go to the auto fix tab and tick level 3 autofix...Then launch game in cli window once game is verified and all good go to img burn now here is the easy part only 2 settings needs to be changed... Layer break settings...1913760 and burn speed..4x. Dont and i stress dont change you book type leave it as is.

,spannerman,2011-01-29T13:54Z,"Hi,
For those having troubles with this game.. Firsly it is genuine. I have downloaded and burnt it ok.

How to guide.

Software needed
a. abgx360.exe (v1.05)
b. imgburn (i have) 2.5.5.0
c. Install the software and visit here

http://www.ixtreme.net/360-backups/abgx-tutorial-t5056.html 
Set your abgx software to the guides settings 
(thanks to original poster)

1) Download the torrent file and unrar it. 
2) You should have one file called ""acb360.iso""
3) Open abgx360.exe and load the acb360.iso
4) Click launch (at the bottom of the program)
5) make sure it completes without errors. I had to run it through twice before I got no errors.
6) You will now notice that you have an additional icon called acb360.dvd. Dble click and Imgburn will open.
7) Use good quility media and burn no faster than x4.

This guide worked for me... Here's hoping for you guys that are having problems."
