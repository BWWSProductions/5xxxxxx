I took the individual files for each page, posted by the other generous donor here on PirateBay, and combined them into a pdf, and made it text searchable.  This is the 1910 version but still very handy to use today, and sure beats paying $200 for a new one.  This is an interesting book to read and has all the legal words I would have been hung up on being a pro se family court litigant.  Thank you to whoever took the many hours needed to scan this whole thing.  That was not me. I did the easy thing using a handy program I also found on PirateBay.
