,maxicastro,2010-11-14T07:27Z,Thank you for this material. Could you please tell me which program you used to convert the original upload to pdf?
,jsweet777,2010-11-15T15:52Z,"Adobe Acrobat Pro Extended - is used to create the pdf. it has the feature ""recognize text using OCR"" short for optical character recognition, which can turn a photograph of text into text that can be highlighted for copy/paste or for finding words using search.  Before running the OCR program, I first selected all the individual files that made up the pages and used Acrobat to combine them into a single pdf.  The other post of this had a pretty nice index, but did not include all the words, and then could not copy paste from it."

,stealthc,2011-01-27T08:21Z,it is sad that the seeding is low.  This is now permanently seeded so that my fellow human beings do not remain in ignorance of the law.  I suggest that you do the same.  This is important and it is your civic duty.  it's worth every bit of space and bandwidth that you spare.
