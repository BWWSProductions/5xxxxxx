,1Itachi,2010-11-12T09:35Z,Finally people started seeding! I was at 1-3% health forever. I was going really good then my download speed dropped! Finally able to finish
,1Itachi,2010-11-12T10:09Z,Why the hell aren't people continuing to seed. People started than stopped again! Instead of my normal 15-30 minute download I'm looking at 2+ hours!
