Firstly, thanks for doing what you do. It's a pretty selfless service that those like you provide, in giving your time, energy, knowledge, etc......to the needy or/and ignorant masses like myself. It's greatly appreciated!

Secondly,  My apologies for posting this query in this particular torrent comment section......but given that the correct torrent was posted 2 months ago (I have posted this query there, by the way) it seems reasonable to me that you might no longer be following that section too closely!

So.....

I have a genuine COA for Windows 7 Home Premium. Can I use it to authenticate/legitimize the Windows 7 Home Premium Service Pack 2 torrent you upped (by the means that the makers intended)?

I ask as it would be a total waste to have it but to then never use it (and, by doing so, perhaps have to deal with some combative anti-piracy, etc, issuing from Microsoft at some X point down the line)?

If it is possible what (if anything) would need to changed/done to the installed download?

Thanks! "

DO NOT Extract Anything With WinRAR!! All That Needs To Be Done Is The .ISO File Needs To Be Burned With The Right Program.

1st of.. thx for the torrent!
(speed was kinda slow, took me like 24 hours for 2.63 Gb's..)but it's WINDOWS 7! Worth it now they've been downloaded! ;)
However, I was about to burn the .iso file... but then I realised there are 2 of them! 1 of them is thrown out in the main folder (and it's 2.607.372 KB), while the other 1 is located in the Windows 7 Ultimate (32 Bit) folder (and it's 2.598.620 KB)..! Which 1 should I burn? They're both called Windows 7 Ultimate (32 Bit).iso

Cheers! :)"
,AlexVance,2010-11-24T10:58Z,"sorry, I just noticed that there are also 2: Windows 7 Activation.exe's, Keys.ini, and the Instruction.txt!
It propably means that you accidentaly copied the files from the folder Windows 7 Ultimate (32 Bit), and pasted them on the main directory.. so the entire size of the torrent is almost double now..!
You might want to look into it if you'd like..!

Either way.. my previous question remains..! Which Windows 7 Ultimate (32 Bit).iso should I use? the 1 in the main folder or the 1 in the Windows 7 Ultimate (32 Bit) folder? (I'm asking because they both have a slight different size..!)"

Seeing as this is Windows 7 Ultimate, I should be getting all 4GB's of my RAM. But as a matter of fact, I am only able to use 2.94GB's of it.. Why is that?..

-------------------

Also, sorry for my double post."

No None Of My Operating Systems Are Pre-Activated, I Don't Like Pre-Activated Operating Systems, Too Many Problems.

But After Windows Installation Is Complete & You're At The Desktop, Run 1 Of The Included Activation Programs & Windows Will Be Genuine :) :)

""ExternalBleeding""

Sometimes There Is Problems When The Data Is Being Burned Too The DVD.... :)

That Is Acurate Data From Microsoft, I Don't Know Why But Any Windows 7 32 Bit Operating System Will Not Detect All 4 GB Of R.A.M.

32 Bit Will Only Detect 3.4 GB Max Of R.A.M.

If You Have More Than 3 GB Of R.A.M. I Reccomend Using 64 Bit Windows 7 :)

Pleaseee help me =)

How would i go about installing this on my mac laptop? Will this 32 Bit version work with my intel i7 2.66 GHZ processor and 4GB ram? I'm not very good with computers and im hoping when i finish downloading this torrent all i have to do is partition my hard drive with Boot Camp burn this to a disk then just install. I have a feeling it won't be that easy tho,

Instruction for mac users would be extremely appreciated thanks =) btw i'm getting 60kb/s average "

No You Do Not Want Too Extract The .ISO File In Any Form, Way Or Fashion.

I Only Use Nero Burning ROM.

But Just ONLY Burn The .ISO File :)

There Is No WinRAR Files, You Shouldn't Be Using WinRAR For The .ISO File.

You Need Too Use Either MagicISO Or PowerISO.

Everything activated fine, and works like a charm when it boots.  About half the time, PC gets hung up on reboot.  Gets to the windows screen, and never loads.  I force a shutdown, and it brings up up the window telling me it wants to repair the computer.  I got your instruction on the command prompt, but i'm not seeing that option to enter anything. If i let it do it's thing, it's says it could  not repair, but when i reboot it usually works.   Seems to be a hit and miss thing, and soemtimes reboots with no issues.

Have you seen anything like this before?  Any thoughts on what the issue could be?

I installed widows 7 successfully...tried to activate using the 'recommended' loader...after that, windows doesnt boot on restart!

The instructions on the txt file for the loader says to run the installation disk and to choose the 'repair' option if this happens. But I don't get the 'repair' option anywhere on booting from the windows disc.. and ended up installing windows 7 again..I'm using a usb drive to install..

Any suggestions on what I need to do to activate successfully??

Your Default Drive Should Be Drive ""C"" ?

Yes If You Have Two Hard Drives, ""D"" Can Be A Back Up, ""C"" Should Be What Windows Is Installed On. :P

So You're Wanting To Upgrade From Windows XP?

That Is NOT Going Too Be A Easy Task, Because You're Not Supposed To Be Able To Upgrade From XP To 7, Supposed To Go From XP To Vista To 7.

i had to give u detailed report about what happened to me:) to decrease comments and find solution faster :D

I have a problem I need help to solve from someone (or two) more expert than me in these things.

I downloaded this torrent, burned it (just the iso) and booted from the DVD.

The problem is the following:
Inside the ""Windows Installation Instructions"" folder there are some pictures

1st one goes well, 2nd one too... for the third picture though, in my computer shows only the light blue background (with the bird on the right and stuff) and does nothing at all!.. and I wait... and nothing!

Note: I have xp

Any suggestions???


Thanks in advance"

2. Then start pressing the delete button slowly, several time, until you end up in a blue (most of the time) screen you probably haven't seen before. That's Bios

3. Once there use the arrows to go to ""Boot"".

4. Then choose priority

5. Then have first the CD-DVD option (for booting from there)

6. Save and Exit.

7. At some point while starting, your PC will tell you ""press any button to boot from CD-DVD"" (you must of course have the cd-dvd inside). Do it!

8. from then on you'll just follow an almost usual instalation... I belive you've done many of those

9. once finished... you have the windows 7"

I'm going say at the outset that this work great, I had no problems with installation and I recommend windows 7 to everyone!!!

*Why I am here is related to several questions that I want to ask:

1) I'm not a big fan of Windows updates, but this white flag on taskbar annoys me, So I just not sure whether to turn on Windows updates, and that nothing bad will happen?!? (Believe me, I have very bad experience with the updates on Windows  xp) 

2) Do you follow the Windows update with activated windows 7 on this way? (I registered the Windows on recommended way, and everything was ok)

3) Did Windows updates think that this is the legal registration, or just that writing in 'my computer' after 'activate' ?

4) I also want to know if this registration was passed Windows Genuine Advantage test, and if it comes with the Windows updates, did I'm going to pass it?

5) What do you recommend I do?

Sorry if I'm been bored, and sorry for bad English...

No matter what happens, I probably will not turn on the update, but would still like to know the answers to these questions!!!

Waiting for your response and your opinion on all this!!!

greetings and thanks  :)"

It says ""wrong volume in drive D"" and it wont finish installing. Some help please?

I have XP 32-bit SP3."

1. After downloading your torrent, if I want to burn windows 7 on a DVD for the default method, do I just insert a DVD in the DVD-rom and drag the windows files on it or do I have to use a specific method like Magic Iso?

2. If I succesfully burned it on a DVD, will it be considered like a Windows 7 installation CD? If it is, will I be able to use this DVD to install windows on a Mac?"

Make sure all files required for installation are available and restart installation.""

I had some problems with installation but I red like 5 pages and I found out what to do, I had problems with installing it, didn't knew I had to burn the iso file to a DvD but after I red your comments and than I didn't had problems anymore. Thank you again dude and I saw some people said they found viruses on this torrent, that is COMPLETELY FALSE, there is NO virus on this torrent.

If you can even get a hold of a windows disk, it'll work for at least a little while, and while you're using that windows from that disk, you can download and burn this torrent, and use it on your computer.

www.wintoflash.com  It makes it possible to boot from your USB ( 4gb usb minimum )

1. Download windows 7/vista from ex. piratebay
2. extract the folder or use daemon tools and copy the content into another folder
3. start wintoflash and choose the usb drive and the location of win7/vista
4. Check up your boot key (ex. DEL, F2, F8 etc)
5. change the main boot to USB slot instead of harddrive, then restart computer
6. The computer will now boot from your USB so just follow the installation, and when the computer restarts for configuration, REMOVE THE USB otherwise it will boot from it again and you will have to reinstall
7. Installation is completed and your good2go!

It's really simple, before I had to lend my friends cd's but now I just go home to them for 10 min, insert the usb and 5 min later it's done!

Way to go technology!"

I have one doubt, mate. I did hide the KB 971033 update during one of my first windows updates. I had Windows update set to automatic. But I started having doubts about installing SP1, since there were mixed opinions about whether 971033 was included in it. Then I learnt that it was. But I went ahead and installed SP1. 

Now, I have SP1 installed. And when I check my hidden updated, 971033 is still in there. Does this mean it was not installed even though it was a part of SP1? (Windows activation status is still activated). And, is it safe for me to keep Automatic Updates on? (Sorry that I'm repeating the question asked so many times. But I'm asking if the 971033 would be avoided even if it is released as a part of something else a la SP1).

Thanks again Computer-User.

P.S. For everyone wondering if this thing is safe, I can only give you my word for it, as little as it might be worth. You just cannot find a product like this with such beautiful instructions. Go ahead!"

The computer originally had vista on it but I used a boot up disk with DBAN on it to destroy all info on the HD. I am now downloading this with uTorrent and once the download is complete I will burn the image to a black DVD using ISORecorder. I will then boot up the pc from this disk and hopefully install Windows 7.

From what I understand this should work right?
Also is it normal that this will take 8 hours to download according to uTorrent?

,asdf672001,2011-11-14T20:37Z,"I shall start at the beginning - inherited a PC from my late brother with a 5oogb hdd, 2gb of RAM an A-live motherboard, and Creative sound sound card - Unfortuntely it had vista on it and after putting up with it for a year decided it had to go  Downloaded 3 days ago, burnt image onto dvd+rw using my Roxio burner and installed without any problem - a very clean install and torrent, many thanks Computer-User. Added a 2nd hard disk and installed W7 on Hdd 1 with XP Pro Sp3 (from goldfish, another very clean and activated torrent) on Hdd 2 which was my first pirate bay download - I encrypted the system partition on both drives using truecrypt which I love - even though W7 ultimate comes with Bitlocker encryption built in, its guide says that entering the bios triggers a lockout which i found 
too restrictive. So far so good - Even though I am not that computer literate I decided to try make genuine W7 using the recommended validation tool in the package - the PC restarted and then a blank screen with a cursor in top left hand corner - went into the bios and booted to the XP drive which thankfully booted -and then i remembered i had forgot to decrypt the system partitions and that true crypt replaces the windows loader with its own (as i said i am not that computer literate so i may be using the wrong technical terms) summary = locked out of W7 on hdd 1 but can access XP on hdd 2 - then i used the truecrypt rescue disk to decrypt W7 and replace the existing loader/header? with the original - after countless re-boots and tinkering with options on rescue disk i finally got W7 back back, and with, to my big suprise the added bonus of a validated and genuine copy of W7 - but then i realised i was locked out of XP pro - dont ask me how I managed that but i did - no problem about reinstalling Xp - wont be tinkering about with headers and volumes in the future unless i really have to unless I do some research - hit home the importance of having 2 drives. I hope this helps someone somewhere.  "
[T],FaeGiN,2011-11-19T23:01Z,"I just had to reply to the comment from FarHouse:   'is it virus? or just many com files that trigger my AVG-anti virus?

The answer is: NO.
You are asking if the CRACK file is a virus called Crack.co.dropper...do you realise what I am saying?
IT IS A CRACK but it is NOT A VIRUS.
To an antivirus company, a CRACK is a VIRUS.
It is not a legit or useful software, it is illegal to use, usually, and cracks often patch system files or patch other files or write to the windows registry...all of these things are also common things for a virus to do. this is why so many people think their crack is a virus.
Hehe that didn't sound right.
Hope you get it now. And this one is DEFINITELY not a virus as I just used it and everything is fine... :)
TIP: If you download Sandboxie - freeware from http://sandboxie.com - then you can run ANY file, even the worst virus you want to try, and not harm your PC at all...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. "
,asdf672001,2011-11-21T22:03Z,"Re: my post of 14/11/11 - The reason I had the problem was because I had left my external flash drive connected after installing the loader  - and that produced a blank screen with a cursor top left hand corner which led me up a false path - Everything about this torrent and added tools and guidance is first class and deserves much praise.

,R780G,2011-11-23T01:46Z,"""Every Windows Update Is Integrated All The Way Up Too November 2010.""

That's not true. I just installed it and after 30' min it got 60 updates to be installed. When I checked their dates, they were all they way back from January/February. So what's up with it? Or I'm a missing/misunderstanding something?

Also, too much stuff in the torrent. With the Loader will be enough, try to put the new version on your next release(v2.0.9) this is kind of old.

However, it is running and working well so far. So thank you for your effort anyways."
