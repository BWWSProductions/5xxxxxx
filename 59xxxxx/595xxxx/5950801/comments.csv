,m4yd4y,2010-11-19T00:28Z,"hey guys, sorry i've on the move recently and haven't had a solid internet connection to seed this on. the point of porting games is that you dont need windows to run the games. these applications create what are called ""wrappers."" these wrappers use X11 to simulate a windows environment, allowing you to run the windows game AFTER YOU INSTALL IT INTO THE WRAPPER.

When you download this, you are downloading three different applications that make three different types of wrappers. They all do the same thing, but some work better for different games than others. The best way to find out which one works best is to experiment.

In order to start you need the following installed on your Mac:
- X11 or XQuartz (preferably both)
- CXZ Game Engines, which can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5291982/CXZ_Game_Engines_[MAC]
- Wineskin wrapper engine versions, which can be found by clicking the ""Manually download and install engines"" button under the ""Engines"" tab when running the Wineskin application
- A copy of the Windows game you wish to port (Cracked versions of the game are better because there are sometimes issues with installing/running the game from the legitimate game CD)
NOTE: MANY RECENT GAMES ARE VERY GRAPHICS INTENSIVE, SO THEY MAY NOT WORK. OLDER GAMES HAVE A HIGHER SUCCESS RATE FOR THIS REASON.

After you have all this, you can start porting games.
Here's some instructions:
1. Choose the type of wrapper you want, Wineskin, CiderX, or CXZ, and make a wrapper by launching the application (Generally, Wineskin works the best)
2. After you have created the wrapper, navigate to it in Finder, right click it, and click Open Package Contents
3. You will see a lot of files, but one should have the word ""Installer"" or ""Install"" in its title. For Wineskin, run ""WineskinSettings"" Double click it to run it.
4. For Wineskin, click install windows software. Otherwise, just navigate to the installer file to begin installing.
5. After you complete the installation, it will prompt you to pick an .exe file. Pick the one that will run the game.
6. If all went well, the game should run. If not, check out the link in the description for advice/help. The form that is associated with the Porting Team is very helpful, so I suggest you join it if you want to really get into this.

DISCLAIMER: PORTING IS A COMPLICATED PROCESS. IT MAY NOT WORK. SEEK HELP AT THE LINK PROVIDED IN THE DESCRIPTION."
