For my FBN show tonight, I held an \"affirmative action bake sale.\" That made some people angry. But I was just doing what Bucknell University students like Kirby Thomas did to start a discussion on affirmative action policies, but the school shut them down.  Hayden Barnes was expelled from his school for criticizing the administration for not being green.  The American university used to be the bastion of free expression, but is it now a haven for ridiculous speech rules?
