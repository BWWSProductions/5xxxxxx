,Mumsemums,2010-11-16T23:30Z,"ALLA spel har funkat för mig utom detta. (ap 2.5 vet jag inte om vad eller vem det är, bara massa folk som säger ap 2.5. Hmm, okej...........)"
,Linwuggz,2010-11-17T00:41Z,"Fungerar inte för mig heller :-/ har också bränt två skivor med alla inställningar som alltid fungerar annars, men det står ""Disc is unreadable"" precis när det ska starta.. Hoppas någon kan förklara hur man ska gå till väga??"

so what is different with this need 4 speed game?

thanks"
,esc_cos,2010-11-17T15:22Z,"okey

but i have looked some on the web and some say that a type of patch will do the job.

AP25 to AP20 Patch. is called this.

found meny tipics about this.

one on youtube: type this: Need 4 Speed Hot Pursuit XBOX360 (AP25 to AP20 Patch) 

and people write there that it works. 

and this is the way to make it work.



Install Notes:
1. Open ap25patch-xbox360.exe and select the path for Need 4 Speed Hot Pursuit.
2. Hit the patch button and wait until it finishes.
3. Burn the new image to DVD and play :) no other updates required.

Apply the patch, then burn it to the dvd it will not work otherwise.


so isent eny of this true?"
,KjmX,2010-11-18T07:28Z,SEED PLZ!!!!!!
,esc_cos,2010-11-18T10:39Z,"okey.

Try craigslist we found a guy in our area who did the flash 4 $15 is was worth it 2 me."

,FucHollywood,2010-11-26T21:33Z,"@filofatty62 if u have a benq or a lite-on u will need new LT Plus flash then patch ur game iso with new ABGX360V1.0.4 it will patch ap25 games. If u have a hitachi here is what worked for another user.EVERYONE WHO HAS A HITACHI DRIVE PLEASE READ THIS!!!!

There is a way to play the game even with firmware revision 78/79, just follow these instructions and it works! I'm playing the game right now without any problems. Note: You need IXtreme 1.51 or it won't work (I assume most people have it already though).

Download new dash (SystemUpdate12611) unzip to usb flash drive ,put it in your 360 & power on.
It would seem the one on the ACBdisk is not full,once youve installed the one from memory stick skip the tutorial & try your assassins creed disk again.
It does now work

I have both a 78 & 79 hitachi model both on ixtreme 1.51 & it works fine on both now.""

Just do exactly as that states and you'll be able to play the game. 

anyone with samsung drives playin these games please post what u r doin as I & others r curious?"

If you want to play this game and ac, heres what you have to do:
1. Update dashboard to kinect version
2. Get LT+ firmware
or if you have 1.51 firmware on hitachi, you should be able to run even this game."
