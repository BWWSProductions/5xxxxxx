CodeWeavers CrossOver Linux 9 Pro

=========================================================

Allows you to run many popular office productivity 
software applications on Linux, such as Microsoft 
Office, Lotus Notes, Microsoft Project and Visio, 
graphics applications like Macromedia Dreamweaver MX, 
Flash MX, and Adobe Photoshop, and many more. 
Not only that, but CrossOver Linux also allows you 
to use many Windows Web browser plugins, such 
as QuickTime and Shockwave, directly on your Linux
 browser. Runs on many popular Linux distributions,
 such as Ubuntu, Red Hat, Novell, SUSE, Xandros, 
Mandriva and others. No Windows Operating System 
license required; CrossOver is a complete replacement 
for your Windows OS as far as your applications are
 concerned. Your Windows Linux compatibility solution!
