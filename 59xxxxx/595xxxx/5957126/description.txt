Plot:
Luke welcomes his friend Matt and his girlfriend Suzie that come 
from London and Matt's sister and Luke's former girlfriend Kate 
that comes from Sydney to sail with him and the sailor Warren 
in a sailboat. However, the vessel hits an underwater rock and 
capsizes with an opening on her bottom. Luke advises that they 
should swim in the north direction to reach the Turtle Island, 
in Queensland, Australia, while they have strength since there 
is a current moving the boat in the opposite direction of land 
but Warren prefers to stay on the hull waiting for help since 
there are sharks in the water. The quartet swims, but they are hunted by a great white shark.
