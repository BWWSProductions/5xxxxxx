De Mornay's character is a mischief-causing temptress who will do anything to escape the confines of prison. Spano is her boy-toy accomplice who struggles to support his dysfunctional, poor family. His "responsible" and serious demeanor is a sharp contrast to De Mornay's "happy-go-lucky" nature, and their sexual tension is the crux around which the movie revolves.

..........A beautiful free spirit whose only want is to play Rock 'n' Roll finds her spontaneous style always gets her in trouble. With a smitten politician in one hand and a husband in the other, she creates her own rules - then breaks them.
