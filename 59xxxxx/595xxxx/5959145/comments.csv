You're welcome, it's good to here some appreciation for the hard work. I really appreciate the politeness of your request, but unfortunately, that's too big of a project, just size wise (1.5 Gb Approx.) I can do things up to about 700mb, but that's about it. I would totally do it, but it's impossible with an upload speed of 15 kb/s."
