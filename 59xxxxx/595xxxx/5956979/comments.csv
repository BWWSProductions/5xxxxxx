,LoonyJ,2011-06-01T04:57Z,"Installed and it worked fine for me. Are you opening it as admin? If so, then try going into the properties and running it under Win XP compatibility."

,volusiacountycomputers,2012-03-04T23:06Z,"This torrent is great. Only thing I notice is for some reason, after running this program more than 15 minutes, the programs processes always goes up, causing the computer to go really slow, and having to manually end the process for FBP. Not quite sure if its just me, but thought I would share my experience. Thanks again for the upload my friend."
