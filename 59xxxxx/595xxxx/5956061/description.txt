Release Notes:

The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks
We're a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark
under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root
of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and
nothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do
this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene
started in the mid eighties
If you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back
on contacting us as soon as possible
twice the fun \/ double the trouble

Additional Notes:

Our Call of Duty: Black Ops release works perfectly(alot have
already completed the game with our crack), sadly our Zombies
Solo mode enabler release gave RELOADED the oppertunity to try
and fool the scene with another stupid proper. Shall we even
mention the Just Cause 2 "proper" from them?
Actually they were in such haste to find a reason to proper
our initial game release, that they did release a "crackfix"
that ruins more than it fixes
Nice try RELOADED, but apparently you didn't had the time to
dig deeper into the understanding of Steamworks CEG protection
and the reason why your "crackfix" does not work at all. You
even left quite a few checks untouched
