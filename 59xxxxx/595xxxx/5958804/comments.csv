,jarman007,2010-11-16T04:36Z,"thanks prashant
great quality as always

i just wanted to say....
i am watching this great mini series 'band of brothers'.....about world war 2.......just loving it

but problem is there is no good source  having small size and good quality

i am currently watching it from a 13 gb torrent
its taking too much time....and i want to keep it  for repeated viewings......but size is very much......i have 250 gb hard disk and too many movies to keep...so will have to delete it after watching

riddlerA has uploaded it but its 480p and quality is not that great........

just check it out http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185906/"
,jarman007,2010-11-16T04:38Z,"in my opinion
