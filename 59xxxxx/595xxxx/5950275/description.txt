Notch slipped an update past without mentioning it in his blog.

He only changed 4 files inside the main minecraft.jar. I checked 2 of them with winmerge and the only differences were some sha1 digests. It seemed kinda important so I decided to upload it.

unzip and replace minecraft.jar in .minecraft\bin
you can put the new version file in there too.
