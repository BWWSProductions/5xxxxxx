,Guuru5,2010-11-12T23:32Z,"Thx TPTB team for putting in your hard work. Appreciate it as always

Sadly this game does`nt start at all for me. Your releases never failed me before.
Running Win 7 x 86, with all uptodate.
Anybody have an idea ?"
[V],Subzero!,2010-11-12T23:57Z,"tested again on several machines, works, you may de-activate your viral tool, to avoid deleting the cracked .dll file inside the archive!... rldata.dll that is, its a false positive now worries..."

,miko1989,2010-11-27T15:10Z,"Best uploaders on TPB THX!!!!


yet this game in particular doesn't work i tried rurning off my antivirus software>rextracting yet still gives me error messages of an unhandled win32 exception occured in cars.exe [2548] just-in-time debbuger 

I use Win XP sp2 official with all updates & yes my device has very high specs & it operates every single game out there + more games to come for like 5 to 6 years of advancement"
,miko1989,2010-12-02T23:25Z,why r u not responding???????
,miko1989,2010-12-07T18:28Z,Please no one download this until the issue is addressed
,mordor21,2010-12-10T18:03Z,"I understand that you may have tested this on multiple systems, but so have I... The problem is while your multiple tessed passed, every single one of mine failed.  And no, it's not the rldata.dll as I still have that in my folder after extracting the archive and running the loader.  I'm sad to say there is something badly wrong with this torrent.  Have you ever thought about dropping all the useless ""Look we hacked this"" junk and just upload .iso like the rest of us?  It would make everything you do run 100% smoother across multiple PC configurations... Just a tip..."
,bassome1,2011-02-23T08:35Z,"Excuse me dude but it asks me for a disc
says: 
No disc inserted.
Please insert the original ""Cars Toon"" DVD.
:( ...?
NOTE: while extracting, my avira anti-virus detected a trojan :P
so i denied it accessing,u think i should let it corrupt my computer so i can play the game xD ??
is it really a Trojan?"
,bassome1,2011-02-23T08:41Z,"Oh My  GOd NOOes xO
D:
it says -the antiVirus-:
(file name): rldata.dll is the TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen Trojan D:
Oh Noes Dx
i need a trojan to play da game wtf :X :P any help ? :) :) :P"
[V],Subzero!,2011-03-02T21:26Z,"its a false positive alert, iam not uploading virus/trojans at all, xpack=xpacker, in other words, the dll file is packed with a tool called xpacker (google) , and your viral tool doesnt knows the packing routine, and thinks its a virus.

disable antivirus (or put the extract folder to an exclusion list in your virus tool)
extract the game again, and play the fukka..."
,crystalisclear,2011-06-18T22:30Z,"I extracted with 7zip , used ""extract here"" option. You have to wait a little for it to unpack. From here you open the added folder and run the "" Loader.bat file "" . Box opens with a message says press any key to continue.....
Then all that plays is a video thanking all the people for there help and a PBAY banner going back and forth with music. I never get the game to come up. Whats the next step? "
,shytan,2011-06-27T19:15Z,Problem:- asks for a cd/dvd. what to do? I didnt get any rld.dll error. plz help
