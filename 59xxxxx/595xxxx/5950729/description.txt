## about ##
A follow up last yearâ€™s successful PC release, Toy Story Mania video game franchise, 
featuring fast-paced, multiplayer, family fun.
 
The game is a frenzied pick-up-and-play experience to be enjoyed by everyone in the room. 
With up to four players at once, Mania games reward competitiveness and cooperation among players.

The game will bring Mater together with Lightning McQueen and the â€œCarsâ€ gang for a new set of adventures, 
capturing the endearing sense of humor of everyoneâ€™s favorite tow truck.

Players will join Mater and his pals as they relive the wild stories he conjures up about hilariously 
unpredictable events that may or may not have taken place.

The voice of everyoneâ€™s favorite tow truck, Mater, will be supplied by Daniel Whitney,â€œLarry the Cable Guy,â€
who also voices the character in the film and cartoon shorts.
