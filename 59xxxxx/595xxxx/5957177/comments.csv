While I do appreciate what you have done here and thank you for your contribution.......this is a terrible, terrible video. It defrags and digitizes in so, so very many spots. I agree most people would not  know what they are looking at as far as poor quality, mainly because they are used to cheap crap anyways. And the Australian guy keeps interrupting the fights with his annoying voice just to tell you they will be showing a re-run of the Hagler Leonard fight from 1987. It happens the whole time! They even cut off the national anthem and dont show any interview follow ups after the fight so they can tell you about the re-run again! Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad torrent! So very, very bad! I'm not overreacting. I'm just not one of these bored housewives or someones Dad that just discovered how to get stuff off the internet like all the other comments seem to be till now.
Bad, bad torrent. Move along. Take the HBO one. If not, you'll be sorry. That ""is"" if you know what your doing. "
