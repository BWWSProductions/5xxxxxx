It is the first studio release since 2008's The Rule Of Thirds & marks a distinctive change in sound. Unlike the more Neofolk sounds of their most recent releases this album is completely piano led, under the moniker of 'Totenkopf Torch Songs'. 

Recorded between December 2009-July 2010 at Big Sound Studios, Adelaide, Australia and Dirty Martini Studios, Bratislava, Slovakia.
