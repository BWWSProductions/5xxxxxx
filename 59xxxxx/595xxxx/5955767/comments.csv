,hc_baby,2010-11-15T07:17Z,the file in this torrent would not play for me. anybody else have same problem?
,hc_baby,2010-11-15T07:53Z,"renaming the file to a shorter name with no dots ("".""s) solved my playback problem. for some reason my system didn't recognize the filename of the avi in the torrent as a valid filename (maybe because it had so many "".""s in it?). it could also have something to do with the format of the drive where i'm storing the file - the drive is formatted as FAT32 to allow for maximum portability...

hopefully this info will help someone."
