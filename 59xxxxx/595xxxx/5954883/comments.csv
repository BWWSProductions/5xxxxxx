,thecaptainofsweden,2010-11-25T08:43Z,"for your information ""BadHabitRemix"", a SINGLE layer DVD-disc is only 4.4gig.
and a DUAL layer DVD-disc is 8.5gig. :)

the most common DVD to be bought by someone like you and me is correctly 4.4gig, but you may buy the DUAL layer 8.5gig by your self.

(also, if you burn a movie to fill a 4.4gig disc you get only half the information space from the 8.5gig disc, and just do a small calculation:
4.4gigabytes: 4 613 734 bytes
8.5gigabytes: 8 912 896 bytes
fill both with the same movie material, but convert it to half the size to fit it in on the 4.4gig.
8.5gig: better quality
4.4gig: worse quality

that's why the movies is much better on the bigger dvd's,  you have more room to burn your file on: enabling better quality (higher bit-rate) to the files.)

almost ALL movies bought on DVD is on dual layer DVD: 8.5gig.
but, most movies do not fill the whole 8.5gig DVD, so when you rip as a full disc-image you get a file of somewhere between 4.5 & 8.5 gig.

so please, BadHabitRemix, check your fact's before you complain again. :)

better luck newt time, an enjoy my proper movie RiPs. :)
