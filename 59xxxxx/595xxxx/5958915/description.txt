"Chuck Versus The Fear of Death" 

Afraid that his latest setback is 
driving a wedge between him and 
Sarah (Yvonne Strahovski), Chuck 
(Zachary Levi) resolves to prove 
himself by going on a dangerous 
mission with the overeager Agent Rye 
(guest star Rob Riggle). Meanwhile, 
Morgan (Joshua Gomez) and Casey (Adam 
Baldwin) scramble as the "Buy Morons" 
attempt to uncover the true identity 
of Greta (guest star Summer Glau.)

Enjoy :)
