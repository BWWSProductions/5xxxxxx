,doctorwatkins,2010-12-04T19:27Z,"Hey, I'd just like to thank you for the torrent, cad.
It works perfectly and I didn't see any virus. The download speed wasn't too bad either.
Thanks again, brother."
,tande89,2010-12-05T12:03Z,it worked fine for me lads. no problems at all. :) might want to recommend adding the high res patch etc for vista and win 7 :)
,hayenne,2010-12-12T19:40Z,"good upload, everything works fine"
,esanhusky,2011-01-13T21:45Z,"Installed and hi-rezzed in XP x64, haven't played it yet, but looks great so far!"
,chrispm84,2011-01-14T10:24Z,Thanks again Cad!!!
,Gravemine007,2011-01-21T17:04Z,Why is it that when I click the Fallout 2 Setup.exe a thing opens saying ''Checking file integrity'' then when the bar fills it just closes.. any help?
,HJDRT,2011-02-01T19:24Z,"Thanks cad, you've brought joy to yet another neckbeard gamer"
,Cyberdevil,2011-02-04T21:04Z,"Works perfectly on 64-Bit Win 7, gotta love GOG games. Good torrent, thanks!"
,cad464,2011-02-05T01:05Z,"@Gravemine007 this happens some times, just let it sit and it should work."
,MADDOGmjb,2011-02-20T02:03Z,"Extracted and installed everything correctly, patched with the high res patch, but when I run the game, I get the error message: Error initializing video mode 640x480. And then it just closes.

Any ideas?"
,mtorresm,2011-03-24T03:05Z,"Just perfect.
This is truly a Good Old Game, it deserved a good torrent. Thanks, cad464.
Will seed."
,joker111,2011-03-29T08:05Z,"same as MADDOG, i get the same error anyone know how to fix it?"
,cad464,2011-04-17T16:30Z,"@Maddog and joker111, If you are using windows vista/win7 try running in compatibility for windows xp."
,sillyjordo,2011-04-25T22:05Z,"The game runs fine, but the colours are all messed up.  I'm using WIN7.  Any advice?"
,cad464,2011-07-13T02:14Z,"that's a common bug, I think running it in compatibly mode will help it "
,cad464,2011-07-13T02:18Z,"*HEADS UP*

I recently found out that for some reason, inventory/save game editors only work on the stock/pre-made chars :("
,unidiot,2011-08-24T16:07Z,"The color issues are related to some general coding issues involving directX. Download killap's patch killap.net and install and then follow the directions. psychedelic display issues should go away after that.
*note* you may have to manually edit the ddraw.ini file. under the graphics section, change the setting to run under dx 9. I believe it's setting 4. check the readme for details."
,unidiot,2011-08-24T16:09Z,"compatibility mode does jack shit. I haven't used this specific copy yet, but vista/7's compatibility mode hasn't actually solved a single issue I've ever dealt with involving legacy apps."
,cad464,2011-09-07T04:24Z,"Well, GOG.com Says it only compatible with XP/Vista "
,tpbusername01,2011-09-10T03:56Z,This game costs only 5 bucks on GOG. Support them if you like the game
,AnthraxB,2012-04-25T13:45Z,"The EXE is tampered with, MD5 checksum dont match, this got a virus.

,naughtydogmom,2012-05-02T04:36Z,anyone experiencing the color problem with windows 7 end explorer.exe for a simple fix
,radbytes,2012-05-29T18:13Z,"Thanks.
It works fine minus the colour problem but really you should just stop complaining and enjoy the game you are getting it for free remember."
,ghostwonder,2012-06-02T18:50Z,"works great,plays great all round awesome also easy intall TY: GOG :> "
