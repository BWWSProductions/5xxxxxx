After failing in school and fighting with his father, 16-year-old Marek (Mirek Caslavka) flees his village for Prague, where he's attacked at the train station. Offered work, he's taken to an apartment, drugged, and introduced into the world of male hustlers. Teaming with David (David Svec, the film's co-scripter), they parlay their situation into a partnership with their boss, saving money and making plans to exit the city. Shown at Montreal's 1997 World Film Festival.
