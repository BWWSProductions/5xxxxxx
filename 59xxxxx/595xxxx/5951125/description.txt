The version by The Alan Price Set reached # 9 in the UK in 1966, and # 80 on the Billboard Hot 100. Creedence Clearwater Revival's version reached # 58 on the US Hot 100 in 1968. In the UK, Bryan Ferry's version reached # 18 in 1993, and the version by Sonique reached # 36 in 1998 and # 5 on reissue in 2000. The song has been recorded by numerous other artists.

Creedence Clearwater Revival (often abbreviated CCR) was an American rock band that gained popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s with a number of successful singles drawn from various albums.

The group consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter John Fogerty, his brother and rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook, and drummer Doug Clifford. Their musical style encompassed rock and roll and swamp rock genres. Despite their San Francisco Bay Area origins, they are sometimes also cited as southern rock stylists.

CCR's music is still a staple of American and worldwide radio airplay and often figures in various media. The band has sold 26 million albums in the United States alone. CCR was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.

Creedence Clearwater Revival is the first album by the American rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival, released in 1968.

The reissue liner notes state that while "Suzie Q" proved to be a hit, the band had played for years as the Golliwogs in the early 1960s, releasing numerous singles before achieving success in the pop world. While the band did gain success with their chart debut, critics initially denied the band any respect.
