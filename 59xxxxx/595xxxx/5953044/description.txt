Out of Australia.Sounds like it's as if Jen grew up in Alabama or somewhere, as if she's just a coal miner's iron willed daughter.They can be folksy or rockin' or countrified, sophisticated or raw, having a versatility that belies their age.
Sometimes it only takes you a few seconds to know if you like an artist, in this case it was like that.

Thankyou Moondingo
