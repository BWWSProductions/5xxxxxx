The Brak Show.
From DVD volumes 1 and 2. This is not an adult swim tv rip. Format is .m4v which has been verified playable on Video lan (vlc) and windows media player. Just a few extras are thrown in for good measure.

Lovable lamebrain Brak and his preying mantis cohort, Zorak, continue their madcap adventures in this compilation of episodes culled from the uproariously bizarre Cartoon Network series set in outer space suburbia. While Brak's loving parents do their level best to raise their son right, the foul-mouthed Zorak does his best to lead his young compatriot astray.
