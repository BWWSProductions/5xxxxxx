,spydrz,2010-11-28T05:29Z,why no comments?? A:  V:   ???
,jds928,2010-11-30T04:25Z,ive downloaded this twice and it wont play with divx player
,chicken-,2010-12-01T18:52Z,Stops playing directly after the Columbia opening sequence...  doubt this is Xbox/PS3 compatible as this won't play in my Magnovox Divx player that plays just about every divx file I've ever thrown at it.  Bad torrent.

,glennc1,2010-12-29T04:55Z,Real or fake? The comments aren't encouraging. 
,deeturtle,2011-01-01T04:52Z,Good A/V but the italian subtitles are not included.  It does contain 2-4 scenes not in the theatrical release. 
,born2b,2011-01-02T00:07Z,Thanks!
,AnotherSmith,2011-01-09T08:19Z,"I've tried this in the very latest VLC player, updated codecs and even tried a utility which analyses a video to see what format it is. It says it's not valid. So either this is a fake torrent or my download was corrupted somehow."
,AnotherSmith,2011-01-09T08:31Z,I've tried this in the very latest VLC media player and updated my codecs. I even tried analysing the file with a video utility - it said it wasn't a video file. So either this is a fake or my download got corrupted somehow? Anyone else have anything to add?

,SinWindow,2011-02-21T19:09Z,Everyone should know by now that movie companies pay people to write bogus comments about quality or viruses just to make others not want to download it.
