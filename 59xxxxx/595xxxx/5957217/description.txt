Hey. 

So here are the traditional tracks extracted from Yothu Yindi's 5 first albums. I can't believe I listen to all that through. Let's just say Australian rock folk ages badly. Really really badly. 

Anyway the traditional tracks KICK ASS and are eternal. 
A must have for any yidaki player wannabe. 

Thank you for seeding as long as you can.
