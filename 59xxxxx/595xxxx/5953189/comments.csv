,AlfNader,2010-11-29T21:44Z,"big_dad_e: How do you encode your videos? This one as well as all others from you that I have DLed are reported by VLC as needing repair (as commented by other users in your torrents besides me). Also the video quality is quite poor (pixelated, blurry, choppy) for the size of the files. 

You are doing well to provide so many of these rare classics which are not available elsewhere on TPB, but it seems like with a few tweaks to your ripping process your uploads could be of dramatically better quality without having to gain in file size.

Thanks,
Alf"
[V],big_dad_e,2010-12-02T08:31Z,"Try burning the files to a DVD.  Your player sounds bugged.  I played the files and don't experience the problems you describe.  If you don't like it here, go buy and stop flaming my tts.  You have nothing to offer TPB except incessant complaining.  I see you didn't even bother to seed what you took."
[V],big_dad_e,2010-12-03T05:47Z,"BTW, I switched ripping software on 11/14, two weeks before quality comments.  The file sizes have doubled and the audio is @320 kbps."
