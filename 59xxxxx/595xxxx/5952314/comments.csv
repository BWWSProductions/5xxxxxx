,mysteryfancy,2010-11-12T18:09Z,thanks for this
,1sh1g4mi,2010-11-13T08:00Z,It is a rather common problem with the torrents that I leak that most seeds won't show up on TPB but trust me they are there and they are usually rather fast.
,crashbandit,2010-11-13T19:02Z,Thanks for this share. Users should be aware however that the installer does not install correctly. The 'airplanes' folder is missing from the install. 
,Jackxon,2010-11-19T17:28Z,"If someony has managed to install this pack without problems, he/she should share ""way"" here... 

THX!"
,1sh1g4mi,2010-11-19T21:48Z,"THIS IS NO AIRCRAFT!

This is the EXPANSION PACK to an aircraft, that has already been uploaded at TPB.

It says so in the title, it says so in the description. Whats there to misunderstand?
Of course you need the aircraft first! And while your at it get some brain too!

,1sh1g4mi,2010-11-24T08:05Z,"No I can not. I'm not your friendly support staff. If you want something like this buy the damn thing.
I'm an ass, get over it.

In almost all cases people are too damn stupid to get something to work or don't get how it works. Its mostly not the fault of the software but the user. I don't care anymore.

Did you try to bring the ingame configuration and load manger up to see if you have to change the modell over these?"
,lessayer,2010-12-30T23:07Z,It does work .... but it puts the model in the 'Aircraft' folder (AI planes) instead of the 'Airplanes' folder. Move it to the correct folder then add the contents of the liveries folder (which is in the 'Airplanes' folder) ..... overwrite the .cfg file and all works perfectly!
,johnny316,2011-03-08T00:20Z,Can anyone seed or give link to basic version of this plane as this one is only expansion to it????
,Raptor05121,2012-01-18T16:10Z,"Guys!!!

This DOES WORK as an standalone unit!!!

The installer puts the aircraft in the SimObjects folder, not the Airplane folder like it should. Make sure the one in the AimObjects>Airplanes folder is the one with FOUR variants. Delete the one that has just two variants. 

Tested and WORKING 100%!!!!

Thank you!"

,Rapterman_123,2012-03-21T22:11Z,Got it to work when you download this install it in to a new folder on your desktop name it what ever you like when it has finished installing in to the folder go in to it click on the folder named  SimObjects go in to it then you will see a folder could Airplanes go in to that then you will see another folder could Carenado C208B Super Cargomaster go in to that then copy the contents of that folder then come out of that folder and then go in the over folder called Carenado C208B Super Cargomaster and paste the contents that you copied in to this folder then a popup screen will appear click the one that says copy and replace then copy the folder called Carenado C208B Super Cargomaster then put it in to your fsx simobjects Airplanes folder then all done. Then put the gauages into the gauages folder.
