If you press SPACEBAR multiple times when you sitting in the chair (in the main menu) you will eventually break free and be able to walk around in the room. The computer is located behind the chair."
,steveo9632000,2010-11-16T01:35Z,Are you guys using this with the SKIDROW release?  Just paste it in the folder correct?

,smdvostok,2010-12-11T17:53Z,It may be Patch 1. If you downloaded the update from skidrow then you need to put the zom fix in again.
,firebirdude,2010-12-14T00:41Z,Works but does not exit properly. PC well exceeds minimum requirements.

,Icystone2,2011-03-10T02:36Z,what does seeds and peers mean?
,Froton13,2011-03-22T10:35Z,Seeds are users with the whole file/files. Peers (aka leechers) are users who are downloading the file/files. 
,Sushyi,2011-04-10T07:36Z,Worked like a charm! Thank you! Works with SKIDROW's torrent. All you have to do is move and replace the BlackOps.exe with this one.
,Hardak,2011-05-22T10:10Z,Works like it says but when I quite the game the monitor stays black and the cursor gets twitchy. How do I fix this?
,Pirate_singer01,2011-06-01T09:16Z,Works like it says but when I quite the game the monitor stays black and the cursor gets twitchy. How do I fix this? and I though I was the only one.
,Pirate_singer01,2011-06-01T09:44Z,for anyone who gets the monitor that stays black and the cursor that gets twitchy heres how to fix it. Just download all the updates for COD Black OPs 1 all the way to 6 run it all and crack it all and it should work. Don't just dwonload the 6th one cause it won't work. Also after all that you updating you don't need this anymore just start it and jump right in to zombie mode....  
,harryham1,2011-06-28T21:03Z,"Please fucking seed (no offence seeders). My internet connection is bad enough without having to worry about seeders.
 The file is 7.5MB. ETA: 4H, 12M"
,nehaljwani,2011-07-13T08:04Z,"@Pirate_singer01
Please tell me where to download the 6 updates.. if you could provide some link.. I would be very much obliged! "
,PitMaGGot,2011-10-20T17:43Z,"When exiting Campaign or zombies game will crash so u must task mnger out and close which isn't an issue 4 a pirated game, but game randomly freezes in random spots after i applied this fix, that's an issue imo, hate having to do things twice, so since zombies isn't really that fun solo and there's barely any chance of beating it solo anyway i'll be reverting back to the skidrow release ty anyway UL, but i'll buy it 4 my xbox so i can MP zombies no need to play something thats impossible alone ^.^"
,PitMaGGot,2011-10-20T17:44Z,oops 4got +1 cuz it works
