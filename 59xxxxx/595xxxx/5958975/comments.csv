,fakebest,2010-11-16T05:52Z,whats up with the scene not using x.264 codec or at least properly they always make the files way bigger than they need to be at least people on here do it right and make these movies smaller than traditional dvd rips yet having 720p quality
,Jack_Raiden,2010-11-18T18:52Z,"fakebeast: This is a very long film and a release with sufficient video bitrate (not cheating like others) and very high bitrate audio, warranting this file size at 720p. The More You Know!"
,somedude.1001,2010-11-20T12:19Z,"dude, your screenshots are too small and has jpeg artifacts all over."
,Blackbird_CaD_,2010-11-21T11:05Z,"Is this a joke?
The title says 720p but the video resolution is 1280x536, so this movie IS NOT 720p.
720p is 1280x720"

,PsychoLogic,2010-11-21T16:19Z,"@Blackbird_CaD_
Have a look at the aspect ratio of the film (or pretty much any other) and tell us how you would fit it into 1280x720.

Only a complete retard would encode with letterboxing or worse, pan and scan to get it to this resolution, and only a bigger retard would complain when they don't."
