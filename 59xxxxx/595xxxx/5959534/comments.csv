,vector1818,2010-11-16T13:14Z,How does someone only get 36 minutes? When do you think the whole screener will be available?
,jimboswe,2010-11-16T13:41Z,"only 36 min. !!!!!!
quality is not bad though!"
,distortedlife55,2010-11-16T17:19Z,"Pretty sure Warner bros just released a 36 minute scr fearing a leak, an hour after posted 141 seeders 79 leechers, warner bros was correct.

Thanks guys!"
,imin1,2010-11-16T18:35Z,wonder if full screener will be uploaded
,ahstpk,2010-11-16T18:43Z,"Well @distortedlife55 if 36 minutes has been leaked the whole movie will be in no time...just let it come in cinema....

1st 36 minutes are not upto expectation...it suffers lack of action and NO SUSPENSE...i repeat no suspense...Worst movie of all parts..!!
7 potter part seems to be the joke of all..It hasnt shown even half of what its in book....ACTION LESS , Suspense less Scene...

,KevMovieMan,2010-11-18T19:27Z,"Warner Bro's is pissed @ this though, they vowed to hunt down the leaker and prosecute. Yes only 1rst 36 minutes but movie in North America gets released this Friday so this is more like an ""EARLY PREVIEW"""

,Remster105,2010-11-18T23:32Z,"Really is a great torrent, good quality, there is a watermark but its really not so bad, the only complaint I have is need the rest of the movie LOL"
,burningrabbit,2010-11-19T04:24Z,I give a fuck about the Potter series. I care about defiling the film industry. Thanks for the u/l. My daughter will enjoy the teaser.
,jason16424,2010-11-19T05:23Z,"I don't call things fake unless they are fake. 
Soon as I get this downloaded I'll post a screeny that its a INSANITY workout clip. 

don't fuggin waste you're time. If you don't believe me wait 20min for me to finish the download and post the screenie. "
,jason16424,2010-11-19T05:32Z,"I take it back, for some reason previewing the video before IT was done was opening up an old torrent I had in the same directory. 

Sorry Green skull my bad =("
,jason16424,2010-11-19T05:33Z,"not fake, my bad. 
Previewing the file before it was completed was opening up INSANITY for some reason O_o.

@ darkexile, what? this clearly states that its 36 mins long and not the full film!!"
,Loginer,2010-11-19T18:34Z,"WB may say they're pissed, but I wouldn't be surprised if this was intentionally ""leaked"" to get people hooked and make them watch the rest in a theatre. Either way, I'm holding out for a full screener/rip/R5."

,jason16424,2010-11-20T01:07Z,"@ AlbaGuBrath

Any Idea when a screener will be out and up?
Movie got released last night but no one's thrown it up?

Also, I have been torrenting for almost 4 years, uploaded 2 torrents - i know but I do seed so :P

Tried to upload a torrent last week and it wouldn't let me, i filled the form out and clicked 'upload' and it just sat there refreshing until it stopped on a white screen???
Firefox most recent version. ideas?

,jason16424,2010-11-20T08:20Z,"So...

,jrdburrow,2010-11-20T09:05Z,"I bet WB themselves released this.  If it were a legitimate pirate they would have got us more than this 36 min screener, think about it, great advertising for those of us who fall for the tease ;)
If I didnt have to spend my money on legitimate BS like bills Id have already went to the theatres to see it, any idea when the full thing will be posted?"
,LETMELOGON3,2010-11-20T10:52Z,enjoyed the first 36 minutes. and am now waiting for the full one to come out on TPB. i've dowloaded half a dozen that say they are the full one but they were all fakes. why is there no full one yet and why are there so many fakes out  :-(

,oobaka,2010-11-27T01:18Z,"Why, in God's name, would more than 500 people download a movie that's only 269 megs?

,oobaka,2010-11-27T13:04Z,"@ tigersquall 
I did and my comment still stands.
Actually, to be more accurate...the quality IS ABSOLUTELY horrendous AND it's EXACTLY 1/4 of the movie. 
Worst quality ""screener"" I've ever seen.

I downloaded it knowing it was 1/4 of the movie because when I went to see it in theater, I missed the first 5 minutes of the movie so this was perfect."
,RareNinja,2010-11-27T13:46Z,what a waste... seriously... 525 seeders???? who would download (& watch) the 1st 36 mins only..... NO 1. the only ppl that would even consider downloadin r ppl who have already seen it
