,forcefox,2010-11-20T12:38Z,Thanks. This is supposed to be in French language so I assume it is dubbed in Spanish
,saintgutfree,2011-01-25T13:14Z,is there any way to get this without the subs so that i can put english subs on? it seems i could just watch this without the subs and be happy but the spanish subs are a little distracting. would be extremely appreciated!
