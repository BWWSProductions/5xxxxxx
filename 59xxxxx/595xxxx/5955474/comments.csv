,PleaseDontBanMe,2010-11-14T06:52Z,Sweeeeeeet!! This update fixed the problems I was having loading zombies(solo) which works fine now and seemed to fix the little issues I was having with shuttering in-game. Thanks.
,Ramsay21,2010-11-15T11:39Z,"I am not able to save this bloody fucking game, what the heck is wrong with it. I played and completed more than 4-5 missions and after that, when i was bored, i clicked on esc button and clicked on option save and exit. Then on the main screen i quit the game. Today morning when i started it, all the save points were gone, and i dont want to play it from start. I only get option to start new game in single player and not resume game or load game? What the fuck....
Even F5 is not working for quicksave, what is wrong with this game. "
