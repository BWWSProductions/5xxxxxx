,paki182,2010-11-17T07:23Z,can you upload shaun white sk8boarding for pc? plzz
,Angerfist_DJ,2010-11-17T18:48Z,doesn't work. Game crashes when you start a career
,davka0107,2010-11-17T19:00Z,"Racing crash fix: Disable force anti-aliasing in your graphic software. For ATI catalyst, set the 3D Quality to balanced. I don't know how to do it in Nvidia software but game stopped crashing"
,Angerfist_DJ,2010-11-17T20:34Z,"it's set to ''application controlled''.
So it's not forced."
,Sarkasmi,2010-11-17T22:40Z,"what davka0107 said worked for me.

Set the 3D to balanced and works.

Angerfist_DJ; Some quadcore systems are having trouble with it, so if you have a quad you could try ""set affinity"" from the task manager process list.

(while in the game, press CTRL + ALT + DEL, open taskmanager, go to process list, right click ""NFS11.exe"" and ""Set affinity"". You should be able to pick a core or choose it to use only 2 cores and it solves the prob for most quads..

Learned that while searching for a fix for my problem, which was fixed without setting the affinity after all.

[T],gangmie,2010-11-18T05:18Z,"very good crack. im playing now thanks.
im using clonedvd NFSHP_2010_EPIDEMZ.NET"
,Angerfist_DJ,2010-11-18T13:34Z,"Sarkasmi bij 2010-11-17 22:40

Did that. I indeed have quadcore.

Selected to run on two cores, the whole game runs like shit and crashes all the time."
,nicolaii,2010-11-18T18:51Z,thnx man! :D
,skreemer,2010-11-19T02:59Z,"This is a VIP member who uploaded the file. I installed and it works.
Btw, you don´t need to unplug from internet, just say you don´t wanna create an account at all times you´re asked and just go to Career option. Have fun, I´m seeding for you this and the iso from EPIDEMZ."
,funkeee44,2010-11-20T07:32Z,WHY THE FUCK IS THIS CRACK TURNING ON MY WEBCAM WITHOUT TELLING ME? I'M GLAD I HAVE A NOTIFICATION LIGHT.  NOT COOL. DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS CRACK OR TRUST THESE PIGS.
,funkeee44,2010-11-20T07:43Z,EXCUSE ME. CRACK IS FINE. IT'S THE GAME TRYING TO SPY USING MY WEBCAM.
,thezeros,2010-11-21T12:21Z,"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fix to crashes: If you have ATI (you can try it with nvidia too, i don't know if it works because i have ATI card) then set AA to ""Application Managed"" I had AA 4x, and now it works.

Some say that setting Affinity to 2 or 1 the game will work but for me it works just bye setting AA to aplication managed so with all 4 CPU's the game is working.
!!!!!!!!!!!"

1. Are you retarded or something? Refer to this:

""Seriously? How many illegal torrents have you come across that you can use online? ESPECIALLY those from EA. Exactly. ""

There's your answer. 

2. 
""no need to enter any serial number, just skip it and install will continue =) ""

Thanks for the upload :)"
,mathias921,2011-02-23T20:51Z,"Great torrent, however [no offence]:
This game looks awful! Looks like an DX8 game
from like 2002 or something, shame on you EA GAMES for selling this worthless uglyass game!"
,KikiGeBanAjoj,2011-02-27T12:54Z,"clean and It work's!
Thans a lot!"
,EndFED,2011-03-15T12:30Z,I got patch 1.2 ( patch 2) Where can I find a crack for this updated one?
,Kossy077,2011-03-21T14:27Z,"@mathias921 No offense mate, but you don't know what you're talking about. On high settings this game looks pretty sweet and moves along at a nice frame rate. It's definitely not as bad as you're trying to make out. 

Oh, and thank you to the uploader."
,trez2,2011-04-03T10:30Z,Great upload took a little under 40 seconds to download works perfectly
,chriqz,2011-05-15T22:20Z,"i download this installed it, put in the crack ran it dint work

,Ali_bhai,2011-05-22T02:59Z,Works like a spell !
,bompidom,2011-07-05T17:33Z,"The game works perfectly with these files and instructions. But the game really sucks! The graphics are ok, but that doesn't help when the game is only at the country and on the mountains. Endless roads and no citys, with terrible driving. 
And worst of all. Where are all the opponents?! Even when you drive as a police on the streets there are absulutely no one to chase. I haven't seen any opponents at all besides the races.
Few cars.. Can't customize them.. EA gone low..

My opinion. Not worth trying. (try Most Wanted instead?)"
,Kanga666,2011-08-15T13:46Z,"I have to say this is the worst driving game I think I've ever played... Can't configure my wheel,graphics are awful and gameplay is crap! Get Dirt 3. Don't waste your bandwidth on this shit..."
,ochowa,2011-12-27T21:54Z,"i have skipped the activation process , that cool ? im waitin for it to install n then use this crackfix.Am i good or what ?"
