This volume explores how and when teachers' knowledge develops through teaching. The book presents international views on teachers' learning from their practice; the chapters are written by mathematicians or mathematics educators from Brazil, Canada, Israel, Mexico, UK, and USA. They address diverse content ??â€œ numerical literacy, geometry, algebra, and real analysis ??â€œ and a variety of levels ??â€œ elementary school, secondary school, undergraduate mathematics, and teacher education courses. The authors employ different methodological tools and different theoretical perspectives as they consider teaching in different learning environments: lecturing, small group work on problems and tasks, mathematical explorations with the support of technological software, or e-learning. Despite these differences, the authors exemplify and analyze teachers' learning that occurred and address the question: "What kinds of knowledge are developed as a result of teaching mathematics and what are the factors that support or impede such development?"......................
