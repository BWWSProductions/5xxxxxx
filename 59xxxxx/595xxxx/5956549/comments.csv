My old English Dub VHS version is starting to die and when it was being copied someone hit the rewind button, so there is like a 30 second rewind which is kinda funny, but annoying. It's nice to see the Japanese version too because all the voices are different and the Japanese Script is sooo much better than the English Dub!

Thanks again for this Great Upload! You are forever my hero! I will Seed this FOR LIFE!!!
A/V-10/10
