,Jangles90,2010-11-13T06:41Z,"What is with the lag ever couple seconds????  I thought it was my pc til i tried all my other games.  Sad to say, poorer performance than skidrows which as has lots of lag."
,munkylad,2010-11-13T07:04Z,man skidrow makes my favorite hacks and i trust they will make a fix because they are that awesome :)

,4km41,2010-11-13T12:36Z,what was wrong with the skidrow crack in the forst place? it was working fine. though i didnt try the MP. 
,jammy2001,2010-11-13T12:50Z,"The problem I get is just a long black screen before anything loads using reloaded's crack whilst skidrows loads normally. Though I do hope reloaded fix that little problem and i'll be happy.

,Nippu008,2010-11-13T16:20Z,Still No Good............the Game Stills Lags.......
,fedfam,2010-11-13T19:19Z,"@Kecman91 Well for many of us, the FPS performance is really low. Slow load times and such. Now apparently it isn't the case for some (like you), but it has been a  very common problem, even for legit installers. Treyarc themselves address the problem on their site and stated they are working on patches. I think they already put some out there.

 Anyways, I myself am waiting on a fix for this. The game is almost (almost) unplayable. My computer is perfectly capable of running this game with OK FPS. But so far has not been the case. "
,ishelic,2010-11-13T19:41Z,"don't even try downloading... its a waste

I'll download skidrow update 1  :)"
