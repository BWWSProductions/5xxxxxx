,BlondeBabe,2010-11-26T23:07Z,"I'm getting same problem as K0Dl22. About 10-15 minutes into the main installation, it asks for a disc!"

,cosworthxyz,2010-11-27T03:56Z,"I mounted the ISO with Virtual Clone Drive.  I then ran setup.exe and configured AutoCAD.  It started installing all the parts.

The last part on the list after AutoCAD 2011 was a ""language pack"", but I don't believe it ever got there."
,cosworthxyz,2010-11-27T04:03Z,"BTW, the ISO file is too large to fit onto a DVD.  I tried Nero and Alcohol 120 with both Verbatum and Phillips DVD-r blanks, and all said not enough room on disk."

,cosworthxyz,2010-11-27T17:14Z,"Thanks.  How did you set up your configuration.  I installed to C:\AutoCAD_2011, not program files.  I tried installing the AutoCAD 2011 selection only and also AutoCAD 2011 and the extra texture option, but both ways it asks for ""disk 1"" at the end of installing AutoCAD 2011.  Did you configure differently?"

DO NOT MOUNT, BUT BURN ON DVD Dual Layer 8.5 GB

SORRY FOR INCONVENIENCE.

TELL ME IF MOR STUFF GOES WRONG, AND ILL FIX IT... DONT KNOW WHY THIS HAPPENDS, ANY IDEAS?"
,cosworthxyz,2010-11-28T18:55Z,"Problem solved.  I mounted ISO with Virtual Clone Drive.  Then unplugged internet cable and shut down my firewall, virus checker, etc and all other running apps.  Then install went fine.  I think problem was either virus checker, firewall, Spybot S&D, or Registry 1st Aid resident code.  Installing with internet unplugged doesn't let you install SP1, but I think you can do that later."

****************************************

                    28-NOV-2011 UPDATE:

Before anything, DISCONNECT internet, turn of firewall and antivirus programs... 

Because these things can cause u trouble like: error while installing ""Insert AutoCAD 2011 disc 1"" message appears, and can't continue installation...

Continue installation following instructions in 1.CRACK_toxic_el folder. Thanks to cosworthxyz for solving this.



* If this problem appears, even when internet is disconnected, firewall and antivirus are off, then extract files from AutoCAD_2011_EFSB_Win_32bit.iso instead of mounting image. Then continue installation following instructions in 1.CRACK_toxic_el folder.

Sorry for any inconvenience. Please rate, leave comment, and SEED."
,BlondeBabe,2010-11-28T23:16Z,"I extracted the iso to my hard-drive and ran set-up - after shutting off the internet, firewall and antivirus. It worked a treat. I was also able to update with the service pack AFTER installation.

,xnetx,2010-12-01T21:40Z,"i have the same problem after i asked google, its not the anti Virus  or the firewall, its the AutoCad language pack asking for disc1 all the time solution worded 100% with me try and comment,

------

To install Autocad in english, do this:

1- extract the *.iso in a temp folder.
2- copy and paste the languages folders (es-ES or fr-FR or pt-BR)in the ""en-US"" folder.
3- go into x86 folder and do the same thing.(if u have it there)
4- rebuild the iso or launch ""setup.exe""
5- choose ""english"" as install language 
6- follow toxic_elvis *.nfo instructions and activate the soft."

I have Windows XP professional, 32 bit.  The part that fails is where the Autocad set up is running through the installment of components (after entering initial serial number, changing configuration according to instructions, etc).  At first, there are some green arrows, indicating success, but they soon change to red x's and then comes up with the message ""Installation Failed"".  I don't even get to the keygen part.  In the install log, in the lines that failed, it says ""failure is ignored. Result 1603""  or ""installation aborted, Result 1603""  (On another try, I had ""result 1619"" and ""result 3""  but most attempts gave me the 1603 result) Any ideas at all?  Help Needed!"

Dowlonaded successfully.  Tried to follow directions.  Winrar would not open the file.  Had to open it with an archive.  Directions were from from #1. There is no file called autocad.exe.  There is a file named setup.exe.  Clicked on that, ran it, installed everything without a problem.  Rebooted.
Next problem:  clicking on ""activate now"" logs itself out since the keygen file takes nearly 20 minutes to open.  Tried it a few times, and I got the number to enter into the keygen, but the code the keygen gives you, there's no place to put it into the registration site, AND, when trying to enter it manually, it is * NUMBERS TOO SHORT."
,poblivion,2011-01-12T06:27Z,"Alright, after FIVE or SIX times, it seems that it works.
Pay attention to the following:
EXTRACT the .rar file to a directory anywhere else than where it has been downloaded.
1.  There is NO FILE named AUTOCAD.EXE.
There is a file named system.exe.  Click on that to install.

2.  When installation is complete, click on the register now or whatever it says.

3.  Run the keygen (the file that is named xf-a2001-......)

Click ""MEMORY PATCH""

Copy request code to the keygen.  
Press GENERATE
COPY ACTIVATION CODE and PASTE IT DIRECTLY TO THE  ""I HAVE A CODE...."" (to the first of the 16 boxes.  The code will paste to all but the last two boxes.  IF you get an error, or ""invalid"" message, click the memory patch AGAIN, click the generate button AGAIN, and repaste the new ACTIVATION code immediately to the first box, and you should be ok.

I may not have explained it as clearly as you or anyone less savvy than myself (and I am hardly the most computer savvy individual out there) but THAT is how I got it to work AFTER two days and SIX tries, for now that is.  Tomorrow morning is another matter.  If it doesn't work tomorrow, you will be indeed hearing from me.

Under install language packs there are some missing files...just press ignore.
When you choose activate run the mem patch and just ok the batch message.
don't choose online activation, choose the other one, and copy the authentication code into the keygen, generate then copy the activation code into acad.
done !

,osirus1st,2011-12-01T18:10Z,ok so im most likely gonna win the dumbass of the day for this but here goes; when I go to install it tells me that i have the wrong operating system. do i need the 64 bit version? im running windows 7
,GreenIvy,2012-01-05T20:06Z,"Solution to AutoCAD 2011 crash or closes or wonâ€™t open or license error 5.2.2.

For those still having the above problems with AutoCAD, who like me have tried all the ideas found on this and other forums I have just fixed it on my computer so I thought I would share it as it may help others.  My problems were with AutoCAD 2011 32-bit reinstalling on Vista which would either activate; license error 5.2.2 or seemed to install properly then on opening I got the splash screen then a grey screen which closed or crashed after a few seconds.

Solution
If still open close AutoCAD and go to; 
(Vista or 7) C:\ProgramData\FLEXnet 
or 
(XP) C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\FLEXnet

Create a new folder e.g. â€˜adskflex removed[todayâ€™s date]â€™, 

(Important â€“ if you have other Autodesk software it may also show up in this folder, only move those relating to this product, you should be able to tell by date installed for each file, it not move all then after this product has been successfully activated, by a process of elimination, move files back to original FLEXnet folder until all Autodesk products are working correctly). 

Move all files starting adskflex (if this is your only Autodesk product installed, if not see above) from the FLEXnet folder into your new folder, ignore any pop up warnings, restart the computer and open AutoCAD, you should now be able to activate or reactivate normally.

(reason for error; the FLEXnet folder contains all activations for all 2010 and 2011 Autodesk products, the license error occurs when one of these files has become corrupted, uninstalling AutoCAD does not remove these files so the problem remains after normal reinstalling)

I can also confirm if you open/extract the iso file via WinRAR you will not get the â€œinsert CD 1â€ message, if you do not use WinRAR or other suitable software you will keep getting the error.
(download WinRAR free 30 day trial from cnet.com NB not 30 consecutive days but each time used counts as one day)

Iâ€™d also like to thank all the forum contributors here and elsewhere for their input & help and toxic_elvis for this excellent torrent.
