My first thought upon hearing about a new First Blood release:
finally. My first thought upon actually hearing the release: where
the hell is John Rambo!? The Rambo gimmick from the first EP and
full-length has been largely dropped in favor of a windmill kick
to the face of the Establishment, but have no fear: First Blood
are still delightfully over the top (like what I did with another
Stallone reference there?), with bone-rattling breakdowns and
unbridled rage tearing at every seam. Instead of the obligatory
Gatling gun and Mr. Stallone screaming audio clips, we are treated
to a wide array of conspiracy theories and social criticism
rhetoric interspersed throughout the album, highlighting the
philosophies of the band. Of course its overbearing, but thats
always been the appeal of First Bloodeverything from the one-word
song titles to the political soap-boxing will polarize listeners.
It will be more than a lot of people can stomach, but it will turn
some people on. Way on.

Silence Is Betrayal retains the strong comparisons to Terror while
playing like the more acerbic follow-up to Madballs Infiltrate
the System. Theres an immediacy present that belies the four year
wait time for the release, as if by their estimation the band had
no choice but to speak up. The title is based on a Martin Luther
King, Jr. speech, and it becomes clear during the intro, if the
artwork didnt already give it away, when Mario Savios voice
drifts in with the famous Bodies Upon the Gears speech, that
its no longer about rescuing POWs in Vietnam, but taking on gross
corruption and injustice right now.

Thats not only the general theme of the record; the music itself
feels like its hurtling toward chilling album closer Armageddon
II, a dire warning about nuclear war. Its call-backs and gang
vocals, a seamless track sequencing linking each mortar shellin
other words, all flow and virtually no ebb; shrapnel in the form
of Carl Schwartzs harsh vocals delivering knock-out punches while
the boys flail fists to the backing beat-down violent enough to
cause a cerebral hemorrhage. Silence Is Betrayal is like the
nuclear war of Armageddon II: once First Blood set it off,
everything within a ten mile radius is doomed.

So the moral of the story is this: politicians are fucking
assholes, and I respect a hardcore band in todays scene thats
not afraid to reach back to the roots of their genre and be a
little outspoken on top of their devastating pit anthems. So its
sound and fury for a reason. But as weve seen before, First Blood
doesnt necessarily need a reason to bludgeon the listener to
auditory deathits just that much more potent now that they do.
