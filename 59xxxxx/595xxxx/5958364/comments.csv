,Gucci1017,2010-12-29T07:14Z,"I downloaded this, perfect quality and subtitles.. But no audio? like theres music and all that but i cant hear them speak at all its just subtitles :S "
,ninoblanco,2010-12-30T00:51Z,"can anybody help me with how to remove the subtitles? or are they permanently hardcopied onto the videos?

great upload. everything is awesome, however I would rather watch them with no yellow subtitles all over the bottom of the screen.... anyway to remove them or turn them off?

please let me know. thank you! "

,MrWhite2,2011-01-23T10:29Z,"If you can't play the files, download VLC media player: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/

If you move or delete the .srt files, it should stop the subtitles."
,cheborneck,2011-04-13T21:44Z,"i appreciate the ups and all... but what kind of moron writes his own subtitle dialog? stupid fuckin' dialog at that! as others have stated, just delete the .smi and .srt files and you're good to go! peace out!"
,cheborneck,2011-04-13T22:56Z,"actually, both your season 1 and 2 have this problem. season 2... this d/l, the audio is completely shot! not worth the d/l"

,dsrs,2011-06-15T19:31Z,"i don't know what these idiots are complaining about. fucking noobs i guess. i just downloaded this. it plays perfectly in vlc. great sound, great video. don't dl the sub files, and/or turn off the sub tracks in vlc. there are no hardcoded subs. this is a great upload. many thanks"
,peekowang,2011-07-22T18:59Z,"if you guys have no audio it may be because the audio track is on 5.1 and you only have stereo? try playing with the output device settings in VLC in WMP or whatever program you use. 

and to everyone:the audio is fine, prefect upload, thanks Konashine!!!"
