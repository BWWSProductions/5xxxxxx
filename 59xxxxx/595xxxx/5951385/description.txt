ARMIN VAN BUUREN - ARMIN ONLY - IMAGINE - 2008 (ISO DVD-R) - PAL - DOUBLE DVD

aturday, the 19th of April 2008.. One big room, over 16,000 party people and the number 1 DJ of the world: Armin van Buuren. This is Armin Only: Imagine, the DVD!

Two years of hard work all came together on one magical night, in the Jaarbeurs in Utrecht (Holland). Armin van Buuren invited all the artists that have contributed to his 3rd artist album Imagine. They showcased their tracks for a sold out venue. The combination of the music, the light effects, the big screen with visuals and the many special features pointed out the theme of the night: Imagine.

Armin: â€˜Armin Only: Imagine has been the absolute highlight of my career. To share the tracks of my album with an audience like this was amazing. Imagine for me stands for the way I visualize music when I listen to it, and a lot of people have that same connection with music, especially trance which is so emotionally driven. Music is very personal for everybody, and what Iâ€™ve realized from my travels is that music transcends everything â€“ the same music can touch people all over the world. You canâ€™t judge someone else on their taste in music, and you canâ€™t turn people onto music that isnâ€™t for them â€“ itâ€™s just something that resonates with each individual. One of the beautiful things about being human is that we can imagine, create, and escape back into our imagination when we want to recall a feeling or invent something newâ€™_I am really sure that this DVD package shows all the in and outs of, especially for me, this very special event!â€™
