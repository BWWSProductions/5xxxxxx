This series opens the doors to the only family-run pawnshop in Las Vegas, where three generations of the Harrison family use their sharp-eyed skills to assess what's real and what's fake. Objects the colorful customers bring in range from the obscure to the truly historic, and it's up to the guys at the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop -- with help at times from their network of experts -- to reveal the sometimes surprising answer to ``What's this worth?''
