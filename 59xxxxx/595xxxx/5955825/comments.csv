[T],jerry7_57,2010-11-15T14:55Z,"You must be new here ZR145, these are ripped from HD TV, not HD. It's alright though, I was once a newbie myself. Enjoy the show."
,ZR145,2010-11-16T07:13Z,I know what ur saying just never got why the hd part was ever mentioned as im sure it will confuse people:). Hence its just standard quality.
,tripper511,2010-11-22T05:35Z,If it was ripped from a standard source then it would look worse then the original.  By being ripped from HD to standard it gives it a high quality standard rip that won't look pixelated if someone chooses to watch this on a HDTV.
,tripper511,2010-11-22T05:37Z,Besides it's well known that if a torrent is HD that it will say 720p or 1080p after it and usually be x264 or mkv.  That's why this just says HDTV rip.
