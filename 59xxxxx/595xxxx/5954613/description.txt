Product Description
With Let There Be Range: Crushing SSNL/MSNL No-Limit Hold'em Games, authors Tri "SlowHabit" Nguyen and Cole "CTS" South offer serious-minded players a high-level yet accessible discussion of no-limit hold'em cash game strategy and theory. Assuming a basic understanding of the online NLHE game (as well as supplemental stat-tracking programs), Let There Be Range provides readers a wealth of advice and knowledge to help them crush low- and mid-stakes games. Let There Be Range consists of twenty chapters compiling numerous ideas and successful strategies employed by the authors, both of whom are long-term earners online at all stakes. The book begins with a brief discussion of fundamental concepts, including hand range, pot equity, fold equity, and expected value, then introduces and explains how to use hand combinations ("combinatorics") to help establish opponents' likely hand ranges and proceed accordingly. From there the authors delve into a consideration of common mistakes made by low- and mid-stakes players as well as methods to exploit these frequently encountered errors. The rest of the book then takes the reader through the various stages of a hold'em hand -- preflop, flop, turn, and river -- taking several detours along the way to consider in detail many concepts and theories that inform winning players' decision-making. With its combination of lecture-like presentations and illustrative hand examples, reading Let There Be Range is much like sitting in on a sequence of study sessions led by two of online poker's most respected poker coaches.
