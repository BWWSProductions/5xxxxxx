,troz1,2010-11-17T02:14Z,Does this one have hard-coded english subs for non-english spoken parts?
,jzaw,2010-11-17T08:03Z,"hi thanks for the ul

what's the difference between this one the Director's Cut and the ORDINARY one pls ?"
,kechiguy,2010-11-20T15:18Z,"GREAT! Yes, it does have subtitles for the non-English parts, but they're part of the regular subtitle set. It came in in record time, with great quality, and Angelina to top it off. Thanks a bunch, NLUPPER002! I'll keep seeding to show my thanks."
,sxp64,2010-11-24T19:27Z,"So, are the subs hardcoded or not? Why don't you mention that in the description?"
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-12-01T03:58Z,"Very good movie. good quality too (well 9.2 GB ;-)
The description is very clear; 2 subs, plain  English & Dutch. No hardcoded and no Forced subs.
Thx NLUPPER
ps.By the way whoever rated down the quality of the torrent is an idiot. "
,unicron_tpb,2010-12-17T08:36Z,Great audio and video!  I dont understand though - Why is there both AC3 and DTS 6ch English ?????
,561Hero,2010-12-19T21:17Z,Why is there AC3 and DTS 6ch English?? Which one will play in 7.1 audio?
,murrambingi,2010-12-28T15:09Z,"why is it downloading so slow? 10KB/s download why?
This is what i have in UTorrent:
Seeds: 25(481) Peers: 18(1401)

Comon ppl seed faster i am seeding 90KB/s and i am still getting 10KB/s."
,murrambingi,2010-12-29T11:48Z,"thx for the upload NLUPPER002,

Absolutely 100% perfect quality.

V = 10
A = 10
M = 9

One question though, why make it a 9.2GB MKV file? when you could have made it into an .avi file or mpeg4 file of the same quality so it is easy to shrink down and burn to disk.
I am converting this to 4.38GB .avi so i can burn to a disk and watch it on my Dvd player.
But other than that this is a perfect copy, excellent job :)"
,newt.atom,2011-01-01T08:16Z,"Just for anyone  using a PS3, this BluRay uses that bloody Cinavia protection."
,nibuoy,2011-01-01T16:59Z,"Help!
The video I just downloaded automatically opens with Dutch subtitles. (I'm using VLC player on a mac) How do I change it to English/play it without subtitles?

The file also came with 2 .nfo files that I can't open or use."
,coolash007,2011-01-04T20:36Z,fukin waste of time.  sound gets blocked on PS3
,Veroryn,2011-01-10T05:18Z,"@coolash007: You should learn to fucking read before DLing, seeing as how newt.atom commented about that the SAME DAY that you DL'd this. Dumbass."
,xantzx,2011-06-12T11:17Z,thanks!
,Bean-Bandit,2012-02-09T05:45Z,You guys are really fuking stupid and a real pro noob for not reading about the fact that sony movies use Cinavia protection. Look it the fuk up and learn you dumb asses.
,Bean-Bandit,2012-02-11T04:06Z,If your looking for a version of this movie that has the Forced Sub's for when they speak Russian this isn't the one for you. How ever if you don't mind there are normal Subs if you don't mind either having them on all the time or turning them on and off.
