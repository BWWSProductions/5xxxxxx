,alladin78s,2011-03-17T19:09Z,"I got a problem, maybe you can help me: When i try to open a template (eg prproj01) i get thiw message: ""this project contained a sequence that could not be opened. No sequence preview preset file or codec could be associated with this sequence type""
Any ideas??? Thanx"
,bapski,2011-05-28T05:08Z,@alladin78s have the same issue as yours. where you able to figure it out?

I also had the same problem but I fixed it.

That message appears on you screen because the Premiere you are using is a TRIAL version.
So, if you downloaded the trial, then it won't work.

But I was sure that I had the full version downloaded. So when I reopened Premiere, a window popped up automatically saying I need to install the codecs because I was still running on the trial version (even though I plugged in the serials)
So, I then clicked O.K., and it installed it for me.

Hope that helped :)"
