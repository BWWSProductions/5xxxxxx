Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (commonly abbreviated as GTA: SA) is a sandbox-style action-adventure computer and video game developed by Rockstar North. It is the third 3D game in the Grand Theft Auto video game franchise, the fifth original console release and eighth game overall. Originally released for the PlayStation 2 in October 2004,[2] the game has since been ported to the Xbox and Microsoft Windows, and has received wide acclaim and high sales figures on all three platforms, and is the highest selling game of all time on PlayStation 2. It was made available on Steam on January 4, 2008.[11] Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was succeeded by Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories and was preceded by Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.

The game is set in the fictional state of San Andreas, comprising three metropolitan cities, Los Santos, based on Los Angeles, San Fierro, based on San Francisco and Las Venturas, based on Las Vegas, with deserts, rivers, forests and even a mountain separating the cities. Set in late 1992,[12] San Andreas revolves around the gang member Carl \\\"CJ\\\" Johnson returning home from Liberty City to Los Santos, San Andreas, after learning of his mother\\\'s murder. CJ finds his old friends and family in disarray. Over the course of the game, CJ gradually unravels the plot behind his mother\\\'s murder while exploring his own business ventures. Like other games in the series, San Andreas is composed of elements from driving games and third-person shooters, and features \\\"open-world\\\" gameplay that gives the player more control over their playing experience. The game adds several features, such as car customization, and character personalization.

Much like the previous and future entries in the Grand Theft Auto series, San Andreas\\\'s critical and commercial success has not been without controversy. The most notable controversy was over the explicit \\\"Hot Coffee\\\" sex minigame found on the Microsoft Windows game, which was disabled but left within the game\\\'s code. Its discovery led San Andreas to be re-rated in the United States briefly as an adults only game and pulled from retailers\\\' shelves in the US. After the \\\'Hot Coffee\\\' minigame code was removed, the game was re-rated as M for mature again.

[edit] History

Following the success of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, consumers anticipated a new Grand Theft Auto game to follow. The first concrete evidence of a new installment came on October 29, 2003, when Take-Two Interactive announced that an untitled GTA game was set for release in the \\\"later half of the fiscal fourth quarter 2004.\\\"[13] Although no further information was available at that point, as to the setting or plot of the new game, there were rumors that it would be based in either the fictional city of San Andreas, California or a Las Vegas-themed Sin City, Nevada.[14]

On March 1, 2004, Take-Two announced in a press conference that Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas would be released on October 19, 2004 in North America, October 22 in Europe, and October 29 for Australia.[15] The first news of the game\\\'s content was revealed on May 11, when it was divulged that San Andreas would not be a city, but rather an entire state consisting of three whole cities and the surrounding territory.

On September 9, 2004, in Take-Two\\\'s third quarter financial results for 2004, it was announced that the release date would be pushed back by a week. In the same release, Take-Two announced the Microsoft Windows and Xbox versions of the game.

San Andreas was released for the PlayStation 2 on October 26, 2004 in North America and on October 29, 2004 in Europe and Australia. It was released in Japan on January 25, 2007.[16] The Windows and Xbox ports were released on June 7, 2005 in North America and June 10, 2005 in Europe and Australia.

On October 20, 2008 it was made available to download from the Xbox Live Marketplace as an Xbox Original at the cost of 1200 Microsoft points.[17]

A Macintosh version, made with Cider, was released on November 12, 2010.
[edit] Gameplay
The player driving towards the Grove Street cul-de-sac in Los Santos during dusk.

San Andreas is structured similarly to the previous two games in the series. The core gameplay consists of elements of a third-person shooter and a driving game, affording the player a large, open world environment in which to move around. On foot, the player\\\'s character is capable of walking, eating, running, sprinting, swimming, climbing (the first GTA game in which swimming and climbing is possible) and jumping as well as using weapons and various forms of hand to hand combat. Players can drive a variety of vehicles, including automobiles, buses, semis, boats, airplanes, helicopters, trains, tanks, motorcycles and bikes. Players may also import vehicles rather than steal them.

The open, non-linear environment allows players to explore and choose how they wish to play the game. Although storyline missions are necessary to progress through the game and unlock certain cities and content, they are not required as players can complete them at their own leisure. When not taking on a storyline mission, players can free-roam and look around the cities, eat from the restaurant, or cause havoc by attacking people and causing destruction. However, creating havoc can attract unwanted and potentially fatal attention from the authorities. The more chaos caused, the stronger the response: police will handle \\\"minor\\\" infractions (attacking people, pointing guns at people, stealing cars, killing a few people, etc.), whereas SWAT teams, the FBI, and the military respond to higher wanted levels.

The player can also partake in a variety of optional side missions that can also boost their character\\\'s attributes or provide another source of income. The traditional side missions of the past games are included, such as dropping off taxi cab passengers, putting out fires, driving injured people to the hospital and fighting crime as a vigilante. New additions include burglary missions, pimping missions, truck and train driving missions requiring players to make deliveries on time, and driving/flying/boating/biking schools, which help players learn skills and techniques to use in their corresponding vehicles.

Unlike Vice City and GTA III, which needed loading screens when traveling between different districts of the city, San Andreas has no load times when the player is in transit (which is notable, given how much larger the in-game map is than in the previous games). The only loading screens in the game are for cut-scenes and interiors. Other differences between San Andreas and its predecessors include the switch from single-player to multiplayer Rampage missions (albeit not in the PC version), and the replacement of the \\\'hidden packages\\\' with spray paint tags, hidden camera shots, horseshoes, and oysters to discover.

The camera, fighting, and targeting controls were reworked to incorporate concepts from another Rockstar game, Manhunt, including various stealth elements,[18] as well as improved target crosshairs and a target health indicator which changes colors from green to red to black depending on the target\\\'s health. The PC version of the game implements mouse chording; the player has to hold the right mouse button to activate the crosshairs, and then click or hold at the left mouse button to shoot or use an item, such as a camera.
The player has a gunfight with members of an enemy gang, the Front Yard Ballas.

In addition, players can swim and climb walls for the first time in the series.[19] The ability to swim has a great effect on the player as well, since water is no longer an impassable barrier that kills the player (although it is possible to drown). For greater firepower, players can also wield dual firearms or perform a drive-by shooting with multiple gang members. Also, due to the immense size of San Andreas, a waypoint reticule on the HUD map can be set, aiding the player in reaching a destination.
[edit] RPG features in character development

Rockstar has emphasized the personalization of the main protagonist by adding many RPG features. Clothing, accessories, haircuts, jewelry, and tattoos are now available for purchase by CJ, and have more of an effect on non-player characters\\\' reactions than the clothing in Vice City. CJ\\\'s level of respect among his fellow recruits and street friends varies according to his appearance and actions, as do his relationships with his girlfriends. Players must also ensure CJ eats to stay healthy and also exercises properly. The balance of food and physical activity has an effect on his appearance and physical attributes.[19]

San Andreas also tracks acquired skills in areas such as driving, firearms handling (when skills are high enough, dual-wielding of certain weapons is possible), stamina, and lung capacity, which improve through use in the game.[19] CJ may also learn three different styles of hand-to-hand combat (boxing, kung fu and kickboxing) at the gyms in each of the game\\\'s three cities. CJ can also speak with a number of pedestrians in the game, responding either negatively or positively. According to Rockstar, there are about 4,200 lines of spoken dialogue.[20]
[edit] Vehicles

In total, there are about 200 types of vehicles in the game[21] compared to the approximate 85 in GTA III. New additions include bicycles, a combine harvester, a street sweeper, a hovercraft, trailers and others. Car physics and features are similar to the Midnight Club series of street racing games, allowing for much more midair vehicle control as well as nitrous upgrades and aesthetic modification.

There are several different classes of vehicles that serve different purposes. Off-road vehicles perform better in rough environments, while racing cars perform better on tracks or on the street. Jets are fast, but usually need a runway to land. Helicopters can land almost anywhere and are much easier to control in the air, but are slower. While previous Grand Theft Auto games had only a few aircraft that were difficult to access and fly, San Andreas has 11 airplanes and nine helicopters and makes them more integral in the game\\\'s missions. There is also the ability to skydive from aircraft, using a parachute. Several boats were added, while some were highly modified.
[edit] Other additions and changes

Other new features and changes from previous Grand Theft Auto games include:

    * Gang wars: Battles with enemy gangs are prompted whenever the player (either alone or accompanied by fellow Grove Street Families members) ventures into enemy territory and kills at least three gang members. If the player then survives three waves of enemies, the territory will be won and fellow gang members will begin wandering the streets of these areas. The more territory owned by the player, the more money that will be generated. Occasionally, the player\\\'s territory will come under attack from enemy gangs and defeating them will be necessary to retain these areas. Once all marked territories are claimed from one of the two other gangs for the Grove Street Families that gang can no longer attack, once you get all the territories none can come under attack.

    * Car modification: Most automobiles in the game can be modified and upgraded at various garages. All car mods are strictly visual apart from a nitrous oxide system which gives the car a speed boost when activated; and hydraulics, which lowers the car\\\'s height by default and allows the player to control various aspects of the car\\\'s suspension. Other common modifications include paintjobs, rims, body kits, side skirts, bumpers and stereo system upgrades.
    * Burglary: Continuing the series\\\' tradition of controversy, home invasion is included as a potential money-making activity.[22] By stealing a burglary van, CJ is able to sneak into a residence at night, and cart off valuables or shake down the occupants.
    * Minigames: Numerous minigames are also available for play in San Andreas, including basketball, pool, rhythm-based challenges (dancing and \\\'bouncing\\\' lowriders with hydraulics), and video game machines that pay homage to classic arcade games. In addition, there are the aforementioned casino games and methods of gambling, such as betting on virtual horse races.[23]
    * Money: The money system has been expanded upon, compared to previous titles. Players can spend their cash on gambling, tattoos, meals, etc. Excessive gambling loss can force the player to sink into debt, which is shown in red negative numbers. When the player leaves a safehouse, CJ gets an unexpected call and a mysterious person tells him about his debts. Four gang members suddenly appear and shoot Carl on sight if he does not erase the debt when the mysterious person calls him a second time.
    * Multiplayer: Rampages have been modified to allow two players to complete them. The players are both shown simultaneously on the screen, meaning they must stay within close proximity of each other. The multiplayer Rampages were removed from the PC version of the game. However, for the PC version, there are also online multiplayer mods called Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas and San Andreas Multiplayer (SA-MP) which allow players to connect with hundreds of people online through various servers and fan-made game modes.

[edit] Setting

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas takes place within the state San Andreas, which is based on sections of California and Nevada. It comprises three major fictional cities: Los Santos corresponds to real-life Los Angeles; San Fierro corresponds to real-life San Francisco; and Las Venturas and the surrounding desert correspond to real-life Las Vegas and the Nevada and Arizona desert.[19] Players can climb the half-mile (800 m) tall Mount Chiliad (based on Mount Diablo), parachute from various peaks and skyscrapers, and visit 12 rural towns and villages located in three counties: Red County, Flint County, and Bone County. Other notable destinations include Sherman Dam (based on the Hoover Dam), a large secret military base called Area 69 (based on Area 51), a large satellite dish (based on a dish from the Very Large Array), and many other geographical features. San Andreas is 13.9 square miles (36 square kilometers),[24] almost four times as large as Vice City, and five times as large as the GTA III rendition of Liberty City. The three cities are linked by numerous highways and a train system. While its predecessors\\\' areas were limited to urban locations, San Andreas includes not only large cities and suburbs, but also the rural areas between them. It also has a fictional version of the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base called ingame the Verdant Meadows Airfield.
[edit] Los Santos
Los Santos, as seen from the ghetto district of Idlewood.

Like its real-life counterpart of Los Angeles, Los Santos comprises several diverse areas. This includes the gang-ridden neighborhoods of Ganton, Willowfield, Jefferson, Idlewood and East Los Santos, based on their actual counterparts of Compton, Willowbrook, Watts, Inglewood, and East Los Angeles, respectively. Also located in the city is a busy downtown section based on Downtown Los Angeles; the wealthy Rodeo and Mulholland districts (based on Beverly Hills and named after Rodeo Drive and Mulholland Drive, respectively); the beach-side districts of Santa Maria Beach and Verona Beach (based on Santa Monica and Venice Beach, respectively); and the glitzy Vinewood and the giant Vinewood Sign (based on Hollywood and its Hollywood Sign). Los Santos features landmarks reminiscent of Los Angeles, which include the Watts Towers, the Los Angeles Convention Center, the Capitol Tower, the Los Angeles City Hall, the U.S. Bank Tower, the Griffith Observatory, the Forum, the Santa Monica Pier, the Vincent Thomas Bridge, Rodeo Drive, the Hollywood Walk Of Fame, the Westin Bonaventure Hotel, Union Station, and Grauman\\\'s Chinese Theater.
[edit] San Fierro
Gant Bridge, modeled after San Francisco\\\'s Golden Gate Bridge.

Like its real-life counterpart of San Francisco, San Fierro is characterized by a prominent cable car system and hilly terrain. San Fierro features several interpretations of many of San Francisco\\\'s districts and landmarks, including the Haight-Ashbury district (Hashbury), the Castro district (Queens), Chinatown, and the Golden Gate Bridge (Gant Bridge). Several other familiar landmarks have been recreated, from the Embarcadero Ferry Building, and the Transamerica Pyramid (Big Pointy Building) to Lombard Street (Windy Windy Windy Windy Street), alongside Edinburgh\\\'s Forth Railway Bridge (Kincaid Bridge)[25] and San Francisco â€“ Oakland Bay Bridge (Garver Bridge). San Fierro\\\'s City Hall closely resembles San Francisco\\\'s ornate city hall. San Fierro also contains remains of the Cypress Street Viaduct which collapsed in 1989 during the Loma Prieta earthquake. A naval base near the city\\\'s airport also has an amphibious assault ship and submarine docked in the bay.
[edit] Las Venturas
A casino on the Old Las Venturas strip.

Like its real-life counterpart of Las Vegas, Las Venturas is home to legalized gambling and several casinos. In these casinos, the player can partake in blackjack, video poker, wheel of fortune, roulette, or play slot machines. In addition to gambling, strip clubs are also prevalent in Las Venturas. Many real Las Vegas Strip casinos are faithfully interpreted on Las Venturas\\\' Strip, including the Excalibur Hotel and Casino (Come-a-Lot), the Sphinx and pyramid of the Luxor Hotel (The Camel\\\'s Toe), Treasure Island (Pirates In Men\\\'s Pants), The Mirage (The Visage), Circus Circus (The Clown\\\'s Pocket), Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Las Vegas) (V-Rock Hotel, which is named after the Vice City radio station), Flamingo Las Vegas (The Pink Swan), Imperial Palace (The Four Dragons Casino), Caesars Palace (Caligula\\\'s Casino), Bally\\\'s Las Vegas (The High Roller), Barbary Coast Hotel and Casino (Starfish Casino), and Casino Royale & Hotel (Royal Casino). Other landmarks include a replica of the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign and interpretations of Vegas Vic and Vicki as Vice City characters Avery Carrington and Candy Suxxx.[26] Suites in several of the hotels are available for purchase. In addition, Las Venturas features a large surrounding desert region, residential areas, and strip malls, as well as a seedy area (Old Venturas Strip) with several strip clubs and gambling parlors based In Las Vegas Downtown.
[edit] Characters
Main article: List of characters in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

The characters that appear in San Andreas are relatively diverse and relative to the respective cities and locales which each of them based himself in. This allows the game to include a significantly wider array of storylines and settings than in Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City. The player controls Carl \\\"CJ\\\" Johnson, a young African-American gang member who serves as the game\\\'s protagonist.

The Los Santos stages of the game revolve around the theme of the Grove Street Families gang fighting with the Ballas and the Vagos for territory and respect. East Asian gangs (most notably the local Triads) and an additional Vietnamese gang are evident in the San Fierro leg of the game, while three Mafia families and the Triads who all own their respective casino are more prominently featured in the Las Venturas section of the game.

Like the previous two GTA games, the voice actors of San Andreas include notablesuch as David Cross, Andy Dick, Ron Foster, Samuel L. Jackson, James Woods, Peter Fonda, Charlie Murphy, Frank Vincent, Chris Penn, Danny Dyer, Sara Tanaka, William Fichtner, rappers Ice T, Chuck D, Frost, MC Eiht and The Game and musicians George Clinton, Axl Rose, Sly and Robbie, Billy Idol and Steve Stevens, and finally Shaun Ryder.[27] Young Maylay makes his debut as the protagonist, Carl.

The Guinness World Records 2009 Gamer\\\'s Edition lists it as the videogame with the largest voice cast, with 861 credited voice actors, including 174 actors and 687 additional performers, many of those performers being fans of the series who wanted to appear on the game.[28]

After living in Liberty City for five years, Carl \\\"CJ\\\" Johnson returns to Los Santos in 1992 for his mother\\\'s funeral. Upon returning, his cab is pulled over by police officers Frank Tenpenny and Eddie Pulaski, who had several run-ins with Carl before he left. The officers put Carl in the squad car, frame him for a fellow officer\\\'s murder, and drop him off in a rival gang\\\'s area of town. Once Carl rides a bike back to his house, he finds his family and friends in disarray.

Carl\\\'s brother, Sean \\\"Sweet\\\" Johnson accuses him of their brother Brian\\\'sâ€”and their mother\\\'sâ€”deaths and berates him for abandoning the gang, the Grove Street Families. In an effort to win back his brother\\\'s favor, Carl then does jobs for Sweet, and fellow gang members Ryder, Big Smoke, and OG Loc. He also becomes protective of his sister Kendl after Sweet discovers that she is dating a member of another gang.

Thanks largely to Carl, the Grove Street Families return to prominence, and Sweet forgives him. While Sweet is preparing for a gang war against their rivals, the Ballas, CJ gets a call from Cesar, Kendl\\\'s boyfriend. The man shows him the Green Sabre being escorted by Big Smoke, Ryder and Tenpenny. This proves the three were involved in CJ\\\'s mother\\\'s death and that Sweet\\\'s plan is doomed. Carl tries to warn Sweet but can\\\'t reach him by phone; in desperation, he tries to rescue him. He withstands the Ballas long enough for SWAT and C.R.A.S.H. to arrive on the scene. Sweet is arrested and Tenpenny takes Carl away with him to \\\'the middle of nowhere\\\' - a small village, Angel Pine, Whestone, isolated between Los Santos and San Fierro. Meanwhile, led by Ryder and Big Smoke, the Ballas take over Los Santos, flooding it with \\\"yay,\\\" a form of crack cocaine.

Carl, realizing Tenpenny is his only hope of staying out of jail or getting Sweet released, continues to run the crooked cop\\\'s errands, and begins killing or discrediting people involved in building a criminal case against Tenpenny. During this time, Tenpenny introduces CJ to an old hippie named The Truth, and CJ helps the hippie with his marijuana farm. Meanwhile, Cesar gets CJ involved in a street-racing club run by the blind Chinese Triad leader and businessman Wu Zi Mu (who is referred to as Woozie). Eventually Carl wins the deed to a San Fierro garage, which he and his friends operate while they wait for an opportunity to return to Los Santos.

In San Fierro, Carl infiltrates the Loco Syndicate, who are supplying the Ballas with their drugs, doing jobs with the main members: Jizzy B. a pimp with a strip club for a front, the head of the gang, T-Bone, the gang\\\'s muscle, and shady government agent Mike Toreno, the gang\\\'s administrator. He is able to kill Jizzy after earning his trust, and tracks the others, along with Ryder, to a deal at the pier. He there assasinates T-Bone and Ryder in a gun-fight, and later supposedly blows up Toreno while in a helicopter. Carl also does jobs for Woozie helping out his Triad in getting rid of a problematic Vietnamese gang, the Da Nang Boys.

It is then revealed that Toreno is, in fact, still alive and an agent for an unnamed branch of the U.S. Government. Carl becomes immersed in the affairs of Toreno, who implies that he will release Sweet if Carl helps him with his covert operations. After training to become a pilot, CJ then carries out operations for Toreno. Later, Carl is invited by Woozie to become a partner in the Triad\\\'s casino in Las Venturas, where they are facing harassment from the Mafia-run Caligula\\\'s Palace casino. Eventually, Carl gets a chance to scope out Caligula\\\'s Casino after The Truth asks him to save rock-band manager Kent Paul, and memberMaccer, whom The Truth lost during a trip into the desert. Kent Paul introduces Carl to the Manager of the Casinoâ€”an ex-lawyer Ken Rosenberg, a former drug addict who has fallen in a depression because of the Mafia feud. He claims that if one family destroys the other, that family will surely kill him. Carl helps him by rescuing Johnny Sindacco from the hands of the Forellis. However, during Carl\\\'s and Ken\\\'s visit to the Sindaccos, they erase the whole family because Johnny recognises Carl and suffers a fatal heart attack. Ken later phones CJ to tell him that the Leones have moved into the casino. Carl does jobs for Salvatore Leone, the Mafia don, to gain his trust whilst planning a heist on Caligula\\\'s with Woozie. During this time, Carl outlives his usefulness to Tenpenny, who tries, and fails, to have him killed. Eventually, Carl and the Triads successfully rob Caligula\\\'s.

Toreno makes good on his earlier promise to release Sweet, but much to Carl\\\'s surprise, his brother wants no part of Carl\\\'s new lifestyle. Sweet insists on returning to Grove Street and working to re-establish the Families rather than rest on the laurels of Carl\\\'s success. Tenpenny goes to trial for several felonies, but the charges are dropped for lack of evidence, as - thanks to Carl - all the prosecution\\\'s witnesses are either missing or dead. Tenpenny\\\'s release sends anger and shock throughout Los Santos. The citizens of Los Santos launch a citywide riot, similar to the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. Fueled by Sweet\\\'s resolve to topple Big Smoke, who has become the city\\\'s biggest drug kingpin, Carl reacquires lost gang territory and hunts down the traitors responsible for pushing drugs that destroyed the Families. He assassinates Big Smoke in a shootout, escapes from the burning crack palace and pursues Tenpenny, who has fled with Smoke\\\'s drug fortune.

Sweet and Carl chase Tenpenny through the streets of Los Santos until Tenpenny loses control of his firetruck and drives it off a bridge with Tenpenny mortally injured. Carl is about to shoot him, but Sweet stops him, as it would look less suspicious if Tenpenny simply died from his injuries. Tenpenny then dies, and the Johnson family are reunited. As his friends and allies celebrate their success, Carl turns to leave. When asked where he\\\'s going, he replies, \\\"Fittin\\\' to hit the block, see what\\\'s happening.\\\"
[edit] Continuity with other Grand Theft Auto games

Many characters, locations and fictional elements from previous Grand Theft Auto games reappear in San Andreas. Catalina, the main antagonist in GTA III, accompanies CJ on a number of missions. Claude, GTA III\\\'s protagonist, also makes a brief appearance as Catalina\\\'s new boyfriend after she \\\"dumps\\\" Carl. They proceed to compete in a street race, which Claude and Catalina ultimately lose. Catalina hands Carl a deed to a garage in San Fierro instead of the car\\\'s pink slip, stating that, \\\"He needs his car to get to Liberty City\\\". In a bit of an inside joke, numerous remarks are made about Claude\\\'s apparent muteness, due to the fact that he had no spoken lines in GTA III. Catalina also continues to call Carl through the rest of the game in an attempt to make him jealous of her new relationship.

Ken Rosenberg and Kent Paul, from GTA: Vice City, feature prominently in several Las Venturas missions in connection with Salvatore Leone, the Liberty City mob boss featured in GTA III and Liberty City Stories. Maria, who later becomes Salvatore\\\'s girlfriend, also appears as a waitress in Caligula\\\'s Palace.

During a shootout at a meat packing industry run by the Sindacco crime family in Las Venturas, in which Ken Rosenberg, subsequently under the influence of cocaine, tries to solidify his relationship with the recently hospitalized Johnny Sindacco, Ken shouts \\\"It\\\'s just like old times, Tommy!\\\" (making an indirect reference to the GTA: Vice City protagonist Tommy Vercetti).

Just like the previous two entries in the Grand Theft Auto series, San Andreas has an extensive number and variety of tracks taken from the time period the game is based in. Notable inclusions to the game\\\'s soundtrack include The Who, Deodato, The Ohio Players, Toto, Faith No More, Depeche Mode, James Brown, Soundgarden, KISS, Rage Against the Machine, Danzig, Alice in Chains, Marshall Jefferson, Frankie Knuckles, Guns N\\\' Roses, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Snoop Dogg, N.W.A., Cypress Hill, 2Pac, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Stone Temple Pilots, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Billy Idol and Ozzy Osbourne.

San Andreas is serviced by eleven radio stations; WCTR (talk radio), Master Sounds 98.3 (rare groove, playing many of the old funk and soul tracks sampled by 1990s hip-hop artists), K-Jah West (dub and reggae; modeled after K-Jah from GTA III), CSR (New Jack Swing, Modern Soul), Radio X (alternative rock, metal and grunge), Radio Los Santos (gangsta rap), SF-UR (old school Chicago house music), Bounce FM (funk), K-DST (classic rock), K-Rose (country) and Playback FM (classic hip hop).

The music system in San Andreas is enhanced from previous titles. In earlier games in the series, each radio station was essentially a single looped sound file, playing the same songs, announcements and advertisements in the same order each time. In San Andreas, each section is held separately, and \\\"mixed\\\" randomly, allowing songs to be played in different orders, announcements to songs to be different each time, and plot events to be mentioned on the stations. This system would be used in Grand Theft Auto IV.

The Xbox and Windows versions of the game include an additional radio station that supports custom soundtracks by playing user imported MP3s.Allowing players to listen to their own music while playing the game. [29]

Prior to its release for the PlayStation 2, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was one of the most highly anticipated video games of 2004, along with Halo 2. San Andreas met most of these expectations, as it was praised as one of the PlayStation 2\\\'s best games, with an average review score of 95%, according to Metacritic,[39] tying for the fifth highest ranked game in PlayStation 2 history. IGN rated the game a 9.9/10 (the highest score it has ever awarded to a PlayStation 2 game), calling it \\\"the defining piece of software\\\" for the PlayStation 2.[23] GameSpot rated the game 9.6/10, giving it an Editor\\\'s Choice award.GameSpot said \\\"San Andreas definitely lives up to the Grand Theft Auto name. In fact, it\\\'s arguably the best game in the series\\\". [19] San Andreas also received an A rating from the 1UP.com network[40] and a 10/10 score from Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine. Common praises were made about the game\\\'s open-endedness, the size of the state of San Andreas, and the engaging storyline and voice acting. Most criticisms of the game stemmed from graphical mishaps, poor character models, and low-resolution textures, as well as various control issues, particularly with auto-aiming at enemies. Some critics commented that while a lot of new content had been added to San Andreas, little of it had been refined or implemented well.[41]

[edit] Hot Coffee controversy

A screenshot of the hidden sex minigame unlocked by the \\\"Hot Coffee mod\\\"

In mid-June 2005, a software patch for the game dubbed the \\\"Hot Coffee mod\\\" was released by Patrick Wildenborg (under the Internet alias \\\"PatrickW\\\"), a 38-year old modder from the Netherlands. The name \\\"Hot Coffee\\\" refers to the way the released game alludes to the unseen sex scenes. In the unmodified game, the player takes his girlfriend to her front door and she asks him if he would like to come in for \\\"some coffee\\\". He agrees, and the camera stays outside, swaying back and forth a bit, while moaning sounds are heard.

After installing the patch, users can enter the main character\\\'s girlfriends\\\' houses and engage in a crudely rendered, fully clothed sexual intercourse mini-game. The fallout from the controversy resulted in a public response from high-ranking politicians in the United States and elsewhere and resulted in the game\\\'s recall and re-release.

On July 20, 2005, North America\\\'s organization that establishes content ratings for video games, the ESRB, changed the rating of the game from Mature (M) to Adults Only (AO), making San Andreas the only mass-released AO console game in the United States. Rockstar announced that it would cease production of the version of the game that included the controversial content. Rockstar gave distributors the option of applying an Adults Only ESRB rating sticker to copies of the game, or returning them to be replaced by versions without the Hot Coffee content. Many retailers pulled the game off their shelves in compliance with their own store regulations that kept them from selling AO games. That same month in Australia, the Office of Film and Literature Classification revoked its original rating of MA15+, meaning that the game could no longer be sold there.[45] In August, Rockstar North released an official \\\"Cold Coffee\\\" patch[46] for the PC version of the game and re-released San Andreas with an M rating. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions have also been re-released in a \\\"GTA Trilogy Pack\\\"[47] for Xbox and PlayStation 2, as well as a Special Edition for PlayStation 2 that includes the documentary film Sunday Driver.

On November 8, 2007 Take-Two announced a proposed settlement to the class action litigation that had been brought against them following the Hot Coffee controversy. If the proposed settlement is approved by the court, neither Take-Two nor Rockstar would admit liability or wrongdoing. Consumers would be able to swap their AO-rated copies of the game for M-rated versions and may also qualify for a $35 cash payment upon signing a sworn statement.[48]

A report in The New York Times on June 25, 2008 revealed that a total of 2,676 claims for the compensation package had been filed.[49]
