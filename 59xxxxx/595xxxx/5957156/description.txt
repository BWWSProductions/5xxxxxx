Another little gem of an album.
One piano,one voice,what more do you want...Tom Waits?

"ME & VAN GOGH" was recorded at the Hi-N-Dry loft in Cambridge, MA, on the late Mark Sandmanâ€™s (phat, low-end) acoustic piano. Billy Conway (Morphine, Twinemen) produced. Tom Dube (Richard Thompson) engineered. Featuring 12 original tunes, â€œME & VAN GOGHâ€ is a return to an earlier, more innocent format (Rick Berlin - piano/voice). Simple, skeletal portraiture. The Song Itself - unadorned.

As true as a torn pocket (â€œBuddhaâ€). As confused as a kid stuck in jail (â€œA Letterâ€). As sad as a beautiful girl alone on a street corner, her heart + loss a thousand miles away (â€œDonâ€™t Talk About Joanâ€). Absurd as a leering drunk with a beer gut (â€œBeer Bellyâ€), or a drive past midnight to nowhere (â€œThe Rideâ€), Berlin creates a world, a town, a topography that seems as familiar as it is unusual. If Van Gogh was alive + wrote songs, they might sound like this album (the title track: â€œMe & Van Goghâ€).
