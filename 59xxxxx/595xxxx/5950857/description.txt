         The Egyptian pyramids have fascinated us for thousands of     
         years. Who built them, how were they built and why? Experts   
         across Egypt are discovering new information that sheds       
         light on the Ancient Egyptians' pyramids and how they         
         evolved. One theory poses that King Sneferu's Bent Pyramid    
         was not a mistake. Recent discoveries show how the pyramids   
         evolved from a mound of rocks and sand to flat, rectangular   
         mastabas, to the pyramid shape, so famously exhibited in      
         the Great pyramid of Khufu and beyond. Now the archaeology    
         is being taken a stage further with new technology. The       
         film shows how the next generation of archaeologists are      
         finally piecing together the secret pyramid code which        
          might have been used by the Egyptians.
