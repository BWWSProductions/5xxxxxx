This soundtrack is not available anywhere but here, commercially or otherwise. After years of searching I eventually had to beg the author if I could buy it from him. When I said that even after the hundreds of soundtracks I had been collecting over the years, this was one of the best I'd ever heard, along with The Chronicles of Narnia and The Fountain, he agreed to send it. He said he "didn't want any money," and a good bottle of wine for his time was enough.
