San Francisco's Train hit the charts with a bang early in the 21st century with hits like "Calling All Angels" and "Drops of Jupiter." They began as a band that courted an alternative audience and quickly traded it -- without changing their sound much -- for a more adult fanbase with mixed results. SAVE ME, SAN FRANCISCO took four years to make -- remember there was Monahan's solo album in the interim -- and involved a slew of musicians (because only Monahan, guitarist Jimmy Stafford, and drummer Scott Underwood remain from the original group), four studios in the United States and England, songwriting collaborators, and even a handful of producers, though Martin Terefe gets the final credit. The truth is it's a very focused record, centering around the theme of a wandering young rocker who falls in love and wants to settle down. Ultimately however, SAVE ME, SAN FRANCISCO is a love song to the band's hometown.
