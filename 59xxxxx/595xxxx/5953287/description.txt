Despite being aschoolboy myself, I did not perceive I was on the wrong
side at any time while watching this movie - as a German patriot too!!!!!

Its a great thrill for all ofstock as it were and that includes
the best of our folks in the UK certainly, along with our family in Germany!

Its a long way to Tipperrary, but my heart waits there too!
