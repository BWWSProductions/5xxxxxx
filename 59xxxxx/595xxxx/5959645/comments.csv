,st0gey,2011-05-18T16:37Z,"I thought this was enjoyable. Easy to see why it has 'cult' status, but rarely have I seen a movie in such dire need of a remake, with better script, cast and budget!


Thanks very much VLiS"

Definitely need a remake but Rowdy Roddy Piper was a bad ass mofo in this flick!"

,netfire_,2011-09-08T21:06Z,"I saw this on TV several times when I was a kid, but I couldn't remember what it's name for the life of me. I've been trying to remember for years, but I just saw something at random that said what it was. AV quality are more than adequate."
,TheRealZork,2011-10-28T04:31Z,"omg saw this as a little kid like 20 years ago and have tried to figure out it's title a bunch of times in the last 10 years.  i could never find it until now, just by chance. can't wait to watch!  i'm totally stoked if you can't tell xD

thanks!"

,OverlordAlexndr,2011-12-21T19:39Z,"How strange, I have also been looking for this movie because I've watched it a long time ago on TV, and I liked it a lot...Twilight zone dude! :]

Which reminds me to say thanks to the uploader for bringing us this movie. Well, THANKS! :] Coming up a review on the quality after I watch it."

It's been 23 years since I first watched this.  I still have it on VHS!  Have searched & searched for a Dvd copy for years with no luck.

VLiS you are a legend!  Pure & Simple!"
,OverlordAlexndr,2011-12-28T21:41Z,"ok, so I watched it, and it turns out I like it.

Quality is great. Many thanks to VLis. And I like his ""discography"" too :]"
