He arranges Parvati's marriage with the Mishra family, promises to pay a large sum of dowry, which he manages to get by promising to get married to a wealthy man's daughter. On the day of Parvati's marriage, he finds out that his betrothed has eloped with her true lover, no dowry is coming in for Parvati's in-laws, shocked he goes to confide in Mishra, the father-in-law, who sarcastically gives him time to accumulate the money as well as a car for his son.
