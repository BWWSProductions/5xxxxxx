,tbone3181,2010-11-14T01:32Z,"man i forgot how slow these new 720p torrents are on piratebay. ive been using torrentday last few months for my major downloads and this wasnt on Tday when it was upped on here. so 19 hrs of downloading later (on 20mb cable internet) im 60.1% done with an average of 64.1kbps. PATHETIC. everybody that uses tpb should try a private site for a while and try and get it into your thick skulls the notion of SHARING. on torrentday this would download in 1 hour @1.5-2MBps because you connect to prob 80,90% of seeds. this torrent im connected to 9 from 578 as i type.....SUCH SELFISHNESS"
,autobotHD,2010-11-14T01:54Z,"    Torrent day not so good for hd content(rar files, almost 99%are scene releases-no wiki,chd esir there)...but a private tracker can't be compared to a public one in terms of speed of course.
But many don't know to tweak their torrent client to increase the max nr of connected peers ,and max nr of slots settings which will help dl faster.

,tbone3181,2010-11-14T03:08Z,"yeh, maybe your points might be true autobotHD, but there is nothing as frustrating as waiting for a movie and then it appears but you have to wait 1,2, sometimes even 3 days!!! salt is a perfect example, i dont do less than 720p blurays (pc plugged into large lcd), so the r5 been around for aaaaages and FINALLY the BR rip comes.....drip drip drip. EXCRUTIATING! rars maybe a pain, but theres nothing like finding a new upload that you really want and you KNOW its gonna fly down"
,rsc666,2010-11-14T21:55Z,"without trying to come off as ungrateful - where are the subs? it would be nice in general if bluray rippers would rip -forced- native language subs into a separate track - 
but for this rip it would be nice if there where any subs at all. There is only at little russian throughout the movie so its not too bad, otherwise a+ rip, thanks

english subs here:

,rsc666,2010-11-16T14:38Z,"roses, your link is dead... but thanks a ton for http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5959324/Salt.DC.BluRay.More.Better.Subs-HR , that is a pretty nice thing you did :)"
,platterpile,2010-11-17T20:50Z,Thank you for a fast and efficient DL. You are a Prince: Cheers to you.
,war59312,2010-11-21T21:42Z,Nice new very short ending. :)
,nittany,2010-11-26T11:49Z,"The torrent link below contains the subs for only the non-english parts of this movie.  Once you open the torrent the smaller .srt file is the one for just the non-english parts, the bigger .srt file is for all the subs.  It works fine, I used the subs below for the SecretMyth release that had no subs.

,mitter,2010-12-02T08:15Z,"thanks for the up!.. But!

This movie is such shit..."
,deftond,2010-12-07T20:03Z,"are you guys retarded, how about info on the quality?  why do so many idiots complain about subtitles?  There is a friggin link by the screen shots for the subtitles..instead of going through the trouble of writting a stupid comment, be a little more observant."
,lozzer22,2010-12-15T15:40Z,Deftond are you retarded? There's links to screen shots right next to the subtitles... instead of going through the trouble of writing a stupid comment be a little less retarded.
,voothai,2010-12-24T06:54Z,"The audio is screwed up.

Unfortunately it's not as simple as one side being louder than the other.  There is also something weird going on with tone ranges... like some are louder on one side than the other.  Might not be noticeable without (good?) headphones."
,Orchonic,2011-01-08T00:38Z,"Z O M F G @ tbone3181 - first of all, when a new torrent comes out, its always slow, second, this is a shitty movie, so people don't like to seed it.  and third, HOW CAN YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT THE DELAY ON GETTING FREE SHIT!!  QUIT WHINING ABOUT HANDOUTS!!  "
,cammag75,2011-01-09T10:26Z,Will not play audio on PS3. Encoded with cinavia.
