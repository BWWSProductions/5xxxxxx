Waarom seed er niemand??
Zo kan het euwig gaan duren heb de hele nacht gedownload met 0.5 kbs"
,donkerinternet,2010-11-15T15:58Z,"NL: Ja je kunt gewoon online gaan spelen alles werkt net als het origineel.
ENG: Yes you can play online like the real game.

Just install the new hex file on your psgroove device from the link in the discription."
,supertommie,2010-11-15T17:05Z,"Hallo,

Ik heb geen jailbreak die ik kan updaten dus geen hex files instaleren kan ik dan alsnog online of niet??"
,DoodleBop,2010-11-16T06:45Z,"Dude, you gotta seed, seriously.
Its been 2 days and i'm only at 40%, and the torrent shows red everywhere.

If you can't seed just don't upload torrents, its simple as that."
,donkerinternet,2010-11-16T17:16Z,"I'm Seeding it now and YES it really works just copy it to your GAMEZ folder on a USB HD and play it or copy it over to the HD of the PS3.
If someone needs a Hex file for his jailbreak device i can deliver it.! Greats Jack"
,meeee2,2010-11-16T18:01Z,"SEED AUB!!!!!

Hoi,

Hoe moet je dit installeren?
En moet je PS3 gejailbreakt zijn om dit te kunnen spelen?

Trouwens, de link die je in de beschrijving hebt staan werkt niet 0.o Er komt dan ""Error 404 - Not Found"" te staan..

,DDRobert,2010-11-17T01:09Z,if this PAL Blu-Ray Game works on NTSC U/C systems then why is it so small (13.57GB) compared to the NTSC torrent 17gb?!
,sheri103,2010-11-17T03:53Z,"it seems everyone is stuck at 81.6 percent. please seed ....

and DDRobert it is small because you just removed the french files from the folder..... the NTSC version has the multilingual files....no offense but .....you need an IQ upgrade ;)"
,statikos,2010-11-17T10:01Z,"hello,
nice upload..can anybody please tell me if the game really works..?if yes what shoud i do to make it work?smthing i must change in my ps3??plz reply  e-mail: riskynick@yahoo.gr"

,snelson0721,2010-11-19T12:20Z,"I have tried everything to play this game.  I put it a usb hd, I formatted the drive in FAT32, I created a GAMES folder, and it does the recognize the files.  PLease, can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?"
,donkerinternet,2010-11-19T15:31Z,In the USB you should make a Folder Named: GAMEZ (not games) and there the Bles or Blus folder. I'm seeding now so! Go for it! (You need a PSGROOVE!)
,azzlips,2010-11-19T20:15Z,"Largest game downloaded as yet by me and easiest to get it working, all I did was to copy to my external HD in Gamez folder and start playing. I loaded the game using Backup Manager V1.00. Thank you for the upload. "
,DDRobert,2010-11-19T21:24Z,"maybe I should've been more specific, trolls, but what I meant to add was, why does this freeze when you play, I know I took the french files out, I did that myself by never choosing to download them with the torrent assclowns. I mean DOES THAT MATTER?! Does it matter and IS THAT WHY IT FREEZES WHEN YOU DIE?"
,Persian_McLovin,2010-11-20T01:51Z,"Thanks so much for this bro, works like a charm...did the standard procedure of copying to GAMEZ folder and worked first time without fail, no editing, crashing...perfect.

So to anyone doubting/complaining...try not being fucking n00bs, listen to this guy and do as he says...bunch of fucking amateurs."

I guess just don't play for hours straight and your saves wont crash. Either way AWESOME GAME, love the zombie play and PS Groove doesn't cost anything, it's freeware."

Awww, go cry to your mummy and using your tears she'll feel wet...something your daddy hasn't done in a longgg time.

Anyways, I've been seeding for days now so make the most of it, I currently have a share ratio of more than 2 so I'm doing my bit unlike the ghetto, skanky, leeching cunts that aren't seeding so happy COD'ing people.

anti p2p organizations are now ddosing users and sending invalidated data OR VIRUSES into our torrents!!

this chocking of our extending seeding is halt !! -able!

download 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/peerblock/files/PeerBlock-Setup_v1.1_r518.exe/download

and prevent most of them from choking you, and rapidsearch for a non viral loic.exe so u can legally retaliate against them!
(ps if u do get a viraled loic.exe u can simply prune the viruses before u reboot, they sit in the main program files menu and a funny looking icon in there as well as your temp folders. simply delete them before rebooting.

,Podgkin,2011-02-27T12:12Z,"All I can suggest - as your wording is a tad vague - is to remove all save files again before trying a full reinstall.
Seems to cure most issues. ;o)
Also, we use Multiman and DON'T let it boot a game without going to xmb first...and selecting from the disc icon."

Anyway if you guys had the same problem as mine,( can hear sounds but only can see black screen) 

then go settings -> Display settings -> Video Output settings -> HDMI(or else) -> CUSTOM -> CLICK EVERYTHING EXCEPT -> save

The reason I couldn't see the screen was I set automatic mode and when I ran this my ps3 automatically set 3D option which my TV doesn't support.

I hope it'd help you guys too :)"
