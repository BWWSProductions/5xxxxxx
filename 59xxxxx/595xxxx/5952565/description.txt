Mirror:

No need for patching its already done by me so you direct can play!

Can I play online on PSN: Yes you Can!!
Do I have to patch it:    No you have not!!
Zombie mode Works too

Just put it on a usb stick from 16GB or higher.

The File is 16.28GB and If you need to fit it on a 16GB USB stick remove all the files in the french folder exept: common_zombie_patch.
So then its only 14 GB. Yes I removed French but keeped some files in it. Sorry
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Some people still don't get jailbreaking and downgrading to 3.41 so:
@lanhec: You need a usb AVR: I recommend the Blackcat USB buy from blackcatjtag <dot) ''com''
and on youtube you can find how to flash a hex (really simple my little sister can do it) and you can downgrade it using hex in discription (second one) and first one is for jailbreak on 3,41 (so downgrade from 3.50) ok? @kistele

Downgrade hex for all AVR boards: http://www.ps3hax.net/downloads.php?do=file&id=538
