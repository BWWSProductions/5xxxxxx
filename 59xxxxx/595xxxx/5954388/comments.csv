,just.dont,2010-11-13T19:55Z,"Plz use crappy AV software more.
Exe is just a self-unpacking rar archive, and the game is pre-cracked."
,ddiggles,2010-11-14T22:24Z,"WARNING! This torrent contains a dropper trojan. Ignore what just.dont says, he only has 2 torrents, neither are seeded or leeched. That should tell you plenty. Bad UL. Should be ashamed of himself."
,ddiggles,2010-11-14T22:24Z,P.S. I used malware bytes.
,just.dont,2010-11-15T12:04Z,"*yawn*

Moar free crappy AV, cheapskates.

And you have 0 torrents, and you are a cheapskate, and you are wrong on 3 statements out of 5 that you've just made. So?"
,just.dont,2010-11-15T12:15Z,"Ok, your crying convinced me that hard that I've made a little investigation.

The game unpacks itself from a self-unpacking rar with a customized UI (THETA credentials, basically), producing an ""install.exe"" (another self-unpacking rar, this time with the game itself minus main exe), a main cracked .exe, and an ""Uninstall.exe"" (custom uninstaller). Then it proceeds to unpack install.exe and when done -- deletes it via bat file.

I suppose it's the last step that make crappy AV software cry (Oh god, it does something and then deletes itself!! Aaaargh!! Virus/trojan dropper!!)"
,dawmail,2010-11-15T12:55Z,"Downloading now. I'll see how it goes: I have a decent AV.
Also, haven't the suspicious people heard of Universal Extractor?"
,Doorz,2010-11-20T00:18Z,The game works and it did not set off my AVAST. Seems fine to me. 
,ddiggles,2010-11-20T03:06Z,"ATTN: I would like to submit an apology as I was for lack of a better word ""Completely F*CKING retarded and ignorant"". Ignore my previous statement of this torrent being fake. 

This torrent is 100% real and true, turn off any antivirus stuff before installing, after turning off Avira after reading another comment on this torrent I tried again and then malwarebytes found no sign of virus, i installed, and it starts perfectly. 

And again, apologies to just.dont. Please do download this, it is perfectly legit and a fantastic upload. I hope the map packs will follow."
,Belkor,2010-11-21T18:23Z,Scanner with malwarebytes too and it did not see off MSE during install. Looks legit and thanks for the upload!
,Sanic7,2010-12-09T21:44Z,"game is alot of fun thanks for uploading! I will seed forever, I was wondering if you could get the map pack 1? "
,algieba78,2011-04-14T01:04Z,housecall found a trojan in the uninstall file. Else the game seems clean and works fine.
