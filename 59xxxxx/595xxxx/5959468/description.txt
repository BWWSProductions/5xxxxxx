SUMO Kyushu Basho- Day 01 - Nov 2010 (Xvid-AVI)

Welcome Back Sumo Fans.  Here is day 01, of the Kyushu Basho

File Folder contains;
-Kyushu.Basho.day.01.E.mpg	Original English broadcast *.mpg
-Kyushu.Basho.day.01.N.mpg	Original Japanese broadcast *.mpg
-Kyushu.Basho.day.01.avi	Dual Language *.avi (use VLC player for best    results)
-Kyushu.day.01.docx		this description, in a document
-Torrent downloaded from *emonoid	advertising!

Choose the file(s) you wish to download, and please seed as long as you can.  The *.AVI file is the smallest (720x480) I dare make it to be able to play on a large screen LCD, as the original broadcast is NOT in HD.  Sorry to those who have asked in the past for me to make it smaller (faster DL).  

To those who haven't downloaded from me before, there ALWAYS seems to be a speed issue in the beginning.  I am on the ass-end of the internet and my provider also caps the speed to different nodes throughout the world.  That's the way it is: sorry!  I continue to seed throughout this Basho until the next one starts, and eventually (patience, younglings!) there are enough seeds (thank you to all who do!) to get the speeds up.  In other words: don't bother commenting on how slow the torrent is going, it's not going to get me to magically "make it go".
