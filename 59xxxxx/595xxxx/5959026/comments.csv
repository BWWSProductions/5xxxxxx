,Reviewer,2010-11-16T05:33Z,"Thanks eztv. This will be the last season for me, the show has become retarded."
,unyversalone,2010-11-16T17:48Z,@Reviewer-I hope thats not the case because I have been very patient downloading every episode. I stopped watching after s5e7 so that I could get them all & watch them without having to wait each week & now I can finally burn & watch them all. It was pretty awesome where I left off.
,detroitmalujoe,2010-11-16T18:13Z,"@ unyversalone, the show is still decent/funny, but it has strayed far from the way it was in the earlier seasons. Personally, I thought the show was funnier and more on point when they were grounded in Agrestic and Nancy was selling her herb there. The plot was more believable then.

As of recent with them being on the run, it has gotten to that offbeat, kind of whacky twists. 

It is still good and watchable if youve watched from day 1, but admittedly if I just started watching it recently I would probably be like WTF. lol"
,jabush27,2010-11-16T18:18Z,I agree the show went down hill about the sixth season
,PriestAres,2010-11-16T21:53Z,I'm gonna give the writers next season and see what happens but it would be 10 times more boring if she was still just sitting in Agrestic

,Jahorse,2010-11-17T05:44Z,I'm hoping with the way last weeks episode ended shit will hit the fan and then eventually get back to some sort of normal. I guess I'll have to watch this and see! Thanks eztv
,azitromax,2010-11-17T09:48Z,This episode was really good! 
,tobiaas.,2010-11-17T19:55Z,THX EZTV!
