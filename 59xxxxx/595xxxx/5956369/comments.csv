,famemon78,2010-11-17T02:07Z,ive finished 99.7% of Twenty Four Eyes but none of the softwares are allowing me to burn it saying its an invalid DVD structure.. i guess those 0.3% are vital to the structure .. could you pls. upload the remaining bits?
[V],polifem2009,2010-11-17T06:36Z,we'll first launch a SOS for some kind soul to help with the unmatched 0.35 and if this doesn't work I'll reupload the whole damn thing.
