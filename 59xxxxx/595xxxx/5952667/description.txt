User Reviews
------
Madness plays like a student-made homage to Texas Chainsaw Massacre Hills Have Eyes etc. The acting is so terrible it is unintentionally hilarious, as I doubt any of the cast have any acting skill experience whatsoever. The plot is basically non-existent and much of the characters actions make no sense at all. The strange thing is that it features Swedish actors playing American characters, who are travelling across backwoods USA, but it is actually filmed on location in Sweden. And the 'bad guys' talk in Swedish whilst the 'good guys' all talk in English with heavy Swedish accents. Rather bizarre.
The violence is pretty brutal and senseless, with some rather effective gore effects (given the shoestring budget), although the violence becomes rather stale, generic and uncreative, with no stand-out set-pieces.
