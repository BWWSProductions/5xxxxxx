          Release Notes:

          Through a haze of ever-bleaker dopesmoke the black
          titans of underground doom, Electric Wizard, rise
          from the unholy grave once again!

          With their new LP Black Masses the legendary
          Dorset bongsmokers delve deeper into the dark
          world of the occult and narcosatanism. Down, down
          further into drugs and hate, to the sleazy shadowy
          world of the blackest masses to the true
          inspiration of the heavy metal art... Lucifer!!!

          With Black Masses, Electric Wizard return to the
          true source of all that is heavy and evil, this is
          their 'Lucifer Rising'; a mind-melting
          hallucinogenic nightmare of drug paranoia and
          misanthropic death wishes.... All in the name of
          Satan!!!

          Some say blessed by the Devil Himself, Electric
          Wizard have been riding a black wave of success
          since the release of 'Witchcult Today' in 2007 and
          have played sold out shows across continental
          Europe, Scandinavia, the UK and Japan, thrilling
          audiences with their incendiary and apocalyptic
          live performances, culminating in near iconic
          status amongst true fanatics and devotees of HEAVY
          music.

          And now they offer you their greatest work and
          bleakest art in unholy thanks...

          From the psychedelic swamp of the ravens they
          summon 8 hymns of pulsating necro-doom, an
          unbelievable wizards brew of early acid rock
          psychedelia, 1970's heavy metal and early 80's
          satanic metal, distilled through endless loops of
          exploitation horror cinema, supersleazy 70's
          necroporn and, inevitably, chronic and habitual
          drug abuse...

          Effortlessly they weave a web of evil with unholy
          strands of pure doom metal and deliriously
          compelling narcopop evil. Designed to ensnare the
          youth of today as mindless slaves of their
          addictive drug:  Doom.  All this packaged in a
          revolting eye-searing nightmare of tasteless
          pop-art trash!!

          Yes, Black Masses is a trip through every aspect
          of everything that's cool about underground
          drug-rock from the head-spinning Satanic
          Psychedelia of Patterns of Evil through to the
          NWOBHM on LSD churning of Turn off your Mind.
          Black Masses is the album Electric Wizard always
          threatened to make. It's here, and listening to
          the end of the world was never meant to sound this
          good!

          Recorded once more in the 100% analogue
          surroundings of Toerag Studios, London. Produced
          by Liam Watson.

          Hail Satan!!
