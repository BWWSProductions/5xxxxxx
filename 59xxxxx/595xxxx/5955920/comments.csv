,showboat911,2010-11-14T09:24Z,"also missing The Mickey Mouse Club early years, and my 4th grade play of tilly the tooth among other irrelivent non Hannibal related videos, but thanks for the effort."
,showboat911,2010-11-14T09:30Z,"yes, its also missing ""The Mickey Mouse Club - The early years"", and my moms copy of my 4th grade play ""Tilly the Tooth"", among other non-Hannibal related epic movies, I'll get all those in a file later..."
,kimjongwil,2010-11-16T04:43Z,"wow showboat911, you're a dick - manhunt IS a hannibal movie - it's one of the sources for ""RED DRAGON"" and it is THE source for Hannibal Lecter himself - it's not your ignorance that's the problem, it's how much of an asshole you are"
,ChuckMeIntoHell,2011-07-10T22:38Z,"The name of the film was not Manhunt, but Manhunt-ER.  Man Hunt (with a space) is the name of a 1941 film which was a thriller set in the time just after WWII.  Manhunt (no space) is a gay porn from 2004 which gets its name from a popular gay hook-up site.  Plus, it's not widely known that Manhunter is based on Red Dragon.  Mistakes happen, now kiss and make up :)"
,ChuckMeIntoHell,2011-07-10T23:01Z,"Also, just to clear up any confusion, Red Dragon was not based on Manhunter, but rather they were both based on a novel with the same name as the more recent movie."
