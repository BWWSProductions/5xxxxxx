Any idea when eps 20-64 will be released? Its not that I won't watch them subbed, as I'm downloading them both right now, but my son loves it, and he's too young to keep up with the subs."

,HaloFan15,2011-02-03T19:41Z,I really appreciate you removing the drm from the episodes. I buy all their dvds and hate the fact that I can't copy them to my hard drive.
,Sd8Td,2011-02-06T10:03Z,"Thanks for taking the time.  listen I am stationed with the army overseas right now so when I want to watch the shows I've missed or even get the same programming from back home I have to turn to the net.  There aren't many uploads suprisingly for a show that is so popular.  I don't care about these wierd japan fetish sickos that prefer watching anything in that annoying ass japanese language.  I here, spit, only in my native tongueamerican/english!  So omegaalpha74 thanx for the dubed upload.  I wouldn't miss any episodes if I were back home.  I'd have my DVR rigged up for sure but this country does not need english dubbed FMA and I'm stuck trying to find torrents when these selfish idiot fucks that I hate to call my countrymen are telling me to watch it in japanese.  Fuck them I didn't tell them they couldn't have they're prefence and they want to push that feeble weak ass internet mob mentality on me, well I guess you know how I feel about that.  Oh that was a load off.  Back to what I wanted to ask.  i have watched 1-20 and ask what is stopping you from uploading 21-32 which is out and current already.  If you don't find the time."
