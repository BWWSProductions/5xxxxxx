Assuming you haven't already found out some answers, hit up Google and find utorrent (this is the simplest) and install that. Then, open up this torrent file inside it. There's heaps of tutorials on how to download with utorrent. THEN, you need a DS emulator like no$gba. Again, there are heaps of tutorials on how to get it running efficiently. Good luck!"
