Just a head's up for those that watch on this player."
,kimiani,2010-11-12T09:56Z,Wow!!! Rob Reiner Film....
,PhilLesh12,2010-11-12T11:06Z,"@kimiani,

I know, really?  The whole time I was watching I thought it had a ""Stand By Me"" feel to it, obviously because of the character narrative aspect, but I had no idea it was actually directed by Rob Reiner until the closing credits!

That was actually a really cool movie.  

And I have a feeling the lead actress is going to be the next Christina Ricci.  Or maybe Natalie Portman, or anyone like that.  

I just hope she doesn't end up like those other child actresses, like Lindsay Lohan or whoever.  That would be tragic, since she's obviously a better actress than any of those nutjobs."
,justregged,2010-11-13T02:27Z,"Doesn't play on wd media player? Really? Im not calling you a liar i just find that a bit hard to believe, i have a WD media player not the live one though the one before that and the only file i could find that it wouldn't play was RMVB and this is just a plain old Avi file with Xvid codac is it not? So i guess my question is are you sure?"

,billybob45,2010-11-22T06:40Z,"If u look at a torrent & it has no screenshots (for porn) or a link 2 boxcover/official info about it (for films or tvseries etc) 1st search thepiratebay often some1 else uploaded the same file & included screenshots 2nd google it or use imdb.com or wikipedia & then copy&paste links 2 the info you find 2 help everyone , it only takes a few seconds per file (once u found the info) ,the more people stop being selfish  the better off well all be, thepiratebay may not be around forever so help out right now please. Also keep seeding dont just hit and run , seed as fast as your isp lets u upload ,the faster your upload speed the faster your download speed is for recieving data thats how bittorent works !im not a hypocrite sometimes when i go 2 post info tpb says database error failed to write..i dont have time 2  go back 2 the files i couldnt help out on , A good place to get help is http://forum.suprbay.org/index.php report fake files or drm files there.
 ,ps if you look at porn remember to respect women theyre gods greatest creation. torrentday your not doing yourselves any good by releasing torrents you fail to seed why would we bother going to your site if we think you fail to seed so many of your releases ?

,cdur,2010-12-12T19:51Z,"billybob45:
 you dumb fuck, theres no way youve been on the torrentday site, or you would know all releases ARE very well seeded. TV shows that no other site have, they have. and with lots of seeders. these torrentday files are upped by someone else, not torrentday. there may be fewers seeds for files but the speeds are way faster
 And if you want to dowload something do your own fucking research, dont rely on someone elses opinions
if people dont know how this shit works they need to stick to paying for it or learn on their own like everyone else"
