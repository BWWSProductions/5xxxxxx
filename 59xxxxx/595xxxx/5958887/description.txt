"In San Cazador, California, the clumsy vampire hunter Edgar Frog is evicted from his trailer. But the best-seller writer Gwen Lieber offers him a job to destroy the head vampire DJ X that promotes worldwide raves to increase his army of undead. Gwen tells that her brother Peter disappeared in Ibiza two years ago in an X-Party promoted by the alpha-vampire. Now DJ X is coming to San Cazador to promote a sacrifice during a party in the blood moon on the next Friday, and Edgar discovers that the rave will take place in a slaughterhouse in an island. Gwen hires also the Hollywood participant of reality show Lars von Goetz that comes with the cameraman Claus. Edgar invites his brother Alan to join the team but he declines, and he teams up with his friend Zoe. When the group finds DJ X, Edgar discloses a secret about the head-vampire."
