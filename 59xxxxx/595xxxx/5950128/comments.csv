cd iw_22 >nul 
..\zip a -tzip -bd -mx1 -r ..\iw_22.iwd >nul
cd .. >nul

,XV8Crisis,2010-11-28T07:19Z,"Hey Shroo, I'm having the same problem as so many others here. I've been using your torrents for years now, so I'm stumped as to why this one doesn't work. Here's the problem:

After extraction, I have no files on the desktop - no game folder, no .exe, nothing. I have a folder named 'main' where I unzipped to the download to. The 'main' folder is full of iw22 and etc. files, as well as a .zip file. Clicking on the .zip file does nothing, as you would expect. 

I've tried using both winrar and 7zip to unzip the torrent. I've tried both the original and the replacement setup.bat. When I try to extract a second time (OVER the first extract), it pauses at 87% and says 'The system cannot find the path specified. '.../zip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operating program or batch file.'

PLEASE help me, as I'm normally good at solving these problems but I'm totally lost on this one! I've been waiting days to download this and play it! And just as well, I love the work you do on your torrents. They're professional stuff. Please help us! Thanks!"
,dardar6t9,2010-11-28T07:32Z,I have the same problem.....At 87% is says error and I dont get a desktop icon.....though in my examination of the files it says 100%...WTF

,ace_009,2010-11-29T14:52Z,"@XV8Crisis

Can you confirm that you got iw_22 file in your main folder since i think thats causing the problem tried unpacking many time but didnt got that file. 

and when i checked in the batch file @ 87% it requests for iw_22 file which is missing and why its not getting extracted properly so if you have that file please make a torrent of that file.

there is iw_21 and then after its iw_23 no iw_22 file there please check again."
,XV8Crisis,2010-11-30T09:00Z,"@ace_009

I have the iw_22 folder which only contains a 'Sound' folder.

I have iw_23 and iw_24, however I have NO iw_21.

Would rather not upload a torrent, but am more than happy to test/bash out a more reports in hoping to get this to work. Thanks for your help."
