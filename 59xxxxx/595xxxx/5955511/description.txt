Product Description
Before transferring to Broadway, The Mystery of Charles Dickens played to tremendous acclaim at the Comedy and Albery Theatres in London during 2000, then toured the UK and returned to the West End for another triumphant run in 2002. This remarkable one-man play is a tour de force that brilliantly interweaves Dickensâ€™ turbulent life story with some of his most memorable fictional charactersâ€”brought to life by Simon Callowâ€™s breathtaking performance. "Dickens was a man possessed with a gloriously theatrical imagination to which Callowâ€™s magnificent performance does full justice." Daily Mail

Charles John Huffam Dickens, 7 February 1812 â€“ 9 June 1870) was the most popular English novelist of the Victorian era and he remains popular, responsible for some of English literature's most iconic characters.

Many of his novels, with their recurrent concern for social reform, first appeared in magazines in serialized form, a popular format at the time. Unlike other authors who completed entire novels before serialization, Dickens often created the episodes as they were being serialized. The practice lent his stories a particular rhythm, punctuated by cliffhangers to keep the public looking forward to the next installment. The continuing popularity of his novels and short stories is such that they have never gone out of print.

His work has been praised for its mastery of prose and unique personalities by writers such as George Gissing, Leo Tolstoy and G. K. Chesterton, though others, such as Henry James and Virginia Woolf, criticized it for sentimentality and implausibility.
