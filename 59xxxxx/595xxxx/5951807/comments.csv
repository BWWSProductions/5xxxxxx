,djmit,2010-11-12T19:37Z,"Secret_myth, Your return is not beneficial at all. When u left torrent world, there were many people who were waiting for Avatar's Good BD Rip. At that time, amiable came up with 11gb print of Avatar.

After ur return, u r still releasing movies like expendables and many crap. We want some good movies that u missed out during ur absent like Avatar , Inception.

People are still waiting for ur avatar and inception copy.

Sorry but this is truth. so avoid uploading new crap movies. Go 4 ur missing era."
