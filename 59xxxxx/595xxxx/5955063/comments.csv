Is there any way we could get the rest of the ""The Gunslinger: The Journey Begins"" comics now that the run is out? There's even a one-off called ""The Gunslinger: Sheemie's Tale"", too. It would be badass if you happened to get those up sometime!"
[V],mirrormaster82,2010-11-18T13:05Z,"I don`t read Gunslinger,I know it`s an awesome series but I just can`t seem to find the time...I`ll see what I can do about that...in the meantime if you`re a batman fan be on the lookout today `cause I got few uploads to do..."
