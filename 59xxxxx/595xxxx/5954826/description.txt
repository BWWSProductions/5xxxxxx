"In Re: Tony Mejia"  

After a Mexican judge decides to try a 
murderer himself, the victim's father 
kills the murderer in a blind rage. 
Now, Garza (Jimmy Smits), Eddie (Jesse 
Bradford) and Lucinda (Carly Pope) 
must help facilitate the father's 
extradition back to the United States. 
Meanwhile, Mereta (Ellen Woglom) has a 
surprising legal problem that requires 
her to go to Al (David Ramsey) for 
help.

Enjoy :)
