[V],joshua13,2010-11-16T20:44Z,why be haters? I don't understand the intolerance and venom that so often comes from people of (usually) no particular religion if not atheists
,iwannashare,2010-11-16T23:32Z,"wow, lots of hate from some users...thats ok though, i pray that the will of God will be done in your lives, and that one day you will come to know Christ...if you do, and you think back to the hateful comments you posted on my torrent, dont worry about it, i forgive you. i know that you do not know God, and i know that you are serving satan, but as long as i think of the person that posted this hate, i will pray for you."
,helpmeobiwan,2010-11-17T03:03Z,sometimes the venom comes from the fact some people realised that theyve been lied to since they could talk!! nail him up i say nail him up ! down with creduility!!

,Otria,2010-11-19T00:05Z,"I rarely post on this site as I don't feel this is a forum (apparently a lot of people think it is). First off I want to ask all people with the faith to believe in something they have never seen, heard or felt a simple question....why? As a child I was raised Baptist. I remember hearing about heaven and thinking are they serious? Streets of gold? If he are ""spiritsâ€ wtf do we need with streets of gold?  This is even as a child.. Grown men still believe this?

This is simple, religion was written by man in a time that men were evil, and this was a vice to get men to think about what they did. IE. Raping and murderingâ€¦Basically doing whatever they wanted.

GOD is as real as unicorns and fairies. Jesus, although I sure he is real is not the son of god...his mother was a whore that was sucking men off for money and ended up fucking one of them (or more). ""I was impregnated by GOD, it's a miracle"" is total shit. The fact that her husband believed her means he was a fucking idiot. 

If my wife comes up pregnant (I had a vasectomy) she is fucking another man...it's no miracle."

,iwannashare,2010-11-19T05:30Z,"im kinda curious why people that do not believe there is a God, or believe that Jesus is the son of God, even bother commenting. i dont watch bull fighting, so i wouldn't comment on bull fighting torrents...yet you guys comment on christian torrents even though you think the things of God are foolish. anyway, this is my last comment, as i no long plan on checking the comments."
,NagaPower,2011-09-22T17:55Z,"Thank you iwannashare. The only people who have problems accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Saviour are those with unresolved problems. But as Christians, we don't have to carry life's burdens alone. We take solace in the fact, the Truth that our Lord is always with us. Jesus died for you and me and forgave us our sins. And just as He forgave us, He also forgave and prayed for those who persecuted and crucified Him."
