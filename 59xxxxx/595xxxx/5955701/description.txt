PERU - TIBET - POLYNESIA - ARCTIC

vanishing cultures reveal their ancient secrets.


On Earth's endangered list, is human diversity most at risk?

Amid fierce debate over globalization, environmental protection and endangered species, have we overlooked our most imperiled resource... human cultures?

In this series, host and renowned anthropologist Wade Davis celebrates the amazing diversity of the world's indigenous cultures and explores their astounding array of spiritual, mythological and medical knowledge. Yet, he warns that they are under threat. Since the 1950s, half the 5,000 languages spoken by the world's indigenous peoples have not been taught to their children. Once a culture is gone, it will never return and its wisdom and secrets are lost forever. Within a single generation, we may lose half of society's intellectual, social and spiritual legacy.

Davis searches for four disappearing cultures in this enlightening series, which includes:
