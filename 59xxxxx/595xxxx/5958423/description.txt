Runtime..........: 01:40:11

Release Notes: This release was right on the brink of 700 and 1400MBs. 700MBs with MP3 would've been
about 840kb/s video bitrate and, with consideration for the frame rate, that is way to low for a quality
release. On the other hand, a 1400MB size with AC3 would've had about a 1560kb/s video bitrate which
would be ridiculous for a tv-xvid. I comprimised between the two at 1119MBs and included AC3 audio which
yielded a very reasonable bitrate at 1170kb/s.
