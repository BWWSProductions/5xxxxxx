BBC Elgar The Man Behind the Mask HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup 2010

The composer of Land of Hope and Glory is often regarded as the quintessential English gentleman, but Edward Elgar's image of hearty nobility was deliberately contrived. In reality, he was awkward, nervous, self-pitying and often rude, while his marriage to his devoted wife Alice was complicated by romantic entanglements which fired his creative energy. In this revelatory portrait, John Bridcut explores the secret conflicts in Elgar's nature which produced some ofgreatest music.
