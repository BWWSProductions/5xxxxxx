PanoTransform translates your 2D mirror ball and panoramic photos into 3D space, rotates the 3D values and then converts it back to a 2D image.

Always produce perfect 360x360 panoramic image. Rather than taking dozens of photos and stitching them together to produce a panoramic image, take 2 photos of a mirror ball at different angles from each other and then mask them together to remove the photographer. PanoTransform is needed to rotate one of the mirror ball photo's to perfectly match the first photo.
