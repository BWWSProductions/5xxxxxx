,pjoopb,2010-11-14T20:05Z,"a very nice download for CS5; works terrifically well; can I update it, if neccesary, by connecting to adobe or do I wait for your update?? please help, I am new to this torrent business!"
[V],thethingy,2010-11-14T20:25Z,"pjoopb, you can update photoshop from photoshop no problem, don't know if the plugin has an update option. "
,ragman420,2010-11-15T02:02Z,Thanks again for another terrific adobe plug-in!  Just a note though CRD for both lines refers to using CRD for both the first name and the last name also the serials for Natural and Pano Transform are reversed.  Try using the Natural serial for Pano and vice versa.
,Balian76,2010-11-18T15:28Z,"Sweet, another great download from the thingy, once I figured out the serials for natural and pano where switched, it's flawless."
,gregscottoh,2011-02-09T21:42Z,"After getting these installed and typing CRD in both the first name and last name and entering the serial number, it says invalid serial number. i switched them and it still says invalid. what am i doing wrong...and thanks thethingy"

I have the same problem,it does not work.
I don't know what i'm doing wrong."
,mightyh,2012-06-18T00:01Z,"To make the serials work, a few modifications must be made. The serial numbers are a six group of numbers separated by a dash (-). The 5th group of numbers next to the last group refers to the year (2010). Change this to the current year (2012) and it should work. Remember to switch the serials of Natural and Pano because they have been erroneously interchanged in the text. First Name and Last name must be typed CRD."
