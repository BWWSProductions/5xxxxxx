[b]Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D


VideoSource: German 720P PFD mkv
thx pfd
AudioSource: Imagines Line
thx imagine

Video: 720x300 @bitrate 1800 2pass
Audio: AC3 2.0 Stereo
Sample: yes included

VideoEncode: added brightness,gamma,sharpness,corrected rgb colours to give 
it more live and added chroma. not too much brightness just that black is black 
on fullscreen and not grey.
the logic mod16 resolution is 720x304, but the faces look a bit eggheaded in this 
resolution same on the 720p mkv.
thats why i decided to make it 720x300
looks a bit better this way.

AudioEncode:
First i had to clean the audiotrack. had background noise, some hiss and hum.
Well normally imagines audio is well synced but by zapping trough i noticed a 
couple of oose scenes starting from -300 up to +500ms.
Which results in effects or words coming to early or too late.
And i am not talking about dark scenes.
All the light scenes have sync issues which is very noticable, especially 
when they are within one sentence.
So it took me 2 hours and 21 cuts to make it sync throughout the movie. 
all major effects and words should be nearly lipsync now.
enjoy[/b]
