Micah P. Hinson is yet another heartfelt fella with a guitar and a notebook full of distressed scribblings. His second album, Micah P. Hinson and the Opera Circuit, stands out from the singer-song-writer crowd, thanks to the uniqueness of the Texan's weary wheeze, the idiosyncratic gypsy instrumentation (accordions, banjos, fiddles), and his adroit way with melody. ''Jackeyed,'' to pick one example, flips from a tear-soaked verse into a horns-blazing chorus that could inspire an entire roadhouse to sing along.
