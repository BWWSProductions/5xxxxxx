                    Channel 4's longest running,             
                    multi-award-winning sitcom Peep Show returns  
                    for a seventh series. Starring David Mitchell  
                    and Robert Webb, the series follows the  
                    increasingly complicated lives of the aging  
                    best buddies/flatmates. In the opening episode,  
                    Mark and Jeremy are at the hospital awaiting  
                    the birth of Mark's baby. Sophie is determined  
                    to have a natural birth and doesn't want Mark  
                    to transfer any of his anxiety to the baby.  
                    Meanwhile, Jeremy is convinced he will never  
                    get over losing Elena, until he meets Zahra,  
                    whose boyfriend is in a coma.
