Sex Matters offers a vision of sex that is healthy, natural, innocent, and free from guilt and repression. Where other books offer tech-niques to practice and games to play, Sex Matters offers insight into the psychological and spiritual dimensions of sex. In responding to questions from people of all ages and from all walks of life, Osho shows how we can, by accepting and cele-brating sex as a gift of nature, begin to use it as a valu-able step-ping-stone in a lifelong journey toward greater self-awareness and joy.
