,DTTNWO,2010-12-05T01:56Z,"I am sorry but I deleted the original recording before I thought about making a better quality version. Also defragmented my hard drive so it was unrecoverable.

I do have a slightly better quality H.264 version with the introduction before the match and the celebration after +plus 13 minutes of the programme that followed it. Total size of file is 1,571,945KB and it's 2.38:30 long.

Not sure if it would be worth uploading even though it is slightly better quality.

thank you!!"
