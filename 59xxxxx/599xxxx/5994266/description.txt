LONNIE SHIELDS  TIRED OF WAITING

Lonnie Shields is truly the next generation of the blues. He cut his blues teeth performing with the Jelly Roll Kings. His recording career has led him through a number of studios from Memphis and Clarksdale to tours all over the world. 

This Delta born guitarist, singer and songwriter\'s style is just the opposite of his demeanor. Lonnie comes across as a mild mannered southern gentleman with a laid back nature. On stage, he is transformed into an extraordinary entertainer moving to his music and feeding off the energy of the audience. His music is deeply rooted in gospel, soul and R & B while his sound, like his soul is never too far from the home of the blues.
