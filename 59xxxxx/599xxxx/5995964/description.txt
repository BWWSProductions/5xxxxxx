The film begins as Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour addresses the wizarding media, stating that the Ministry remains strong as Lord Voldemort increases in power. Severus Snape meets with Voldemort and the Death Eaters to inform them of Harry's departure from Privet Drive. Voldemort takes Lucius Malfoy's wand from him, as his own shares the same core as Harry's and therefore cannot be used to kill Harry.

The Order of the Phoenix arrive at Privet Drive planning to move Harry to safety using Polyjuice Potion to create six decoys. During their flight they are ambushed, resulting in the deaths of Hedwig and Mad-Eye Moody. Voldemort's borrowed wand fails to kill Harry. That night, Harry has a dream in which he sees Ollivander being tormented by Voldemort, who claims that the wand-maker had lied to him for having said that a different wand would succeed in killing Harry
