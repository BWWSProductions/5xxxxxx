,roriek01,2010-12-22T18:27Z,"Guys, all you have to do to get it to work is use Daemon Tools Lite, mount both the install disc and play disc then it should work when it asks for the other disk. And you have to install the Single Player Only option as the full install needs a cinematic disk which isn't here. :("

,A7X050393,2011-08-03T01:28Z,"People with errors make sure you follow the instructions perfectly from Wack_Sparrow.

Make sure you install the update (in the expansion iso. file)  and copy it into the correct folder (you should get an overwrite confirmation when you try to copy 'game.exe')

That solved my error with Location:C:\Projects\Diablo2\Source\D2Win\Src\D2WinTextBox.cpp, line #278.

PS. Dont think you can play Diablo II without installing expansion first, because the crack is for Expansion not the first game.

Follow this and will work :
1- Mount install disc and install .
2- The installer will need the play disc to continue , so mount play disc now and click ""ok"".
3- After Finished , mount LoD expansion if u wanna and only wait.
4- If u wanna patch 1.11 go to your expansion disc/crack and get he and open on diablo 2 folder and only wait to patch. 
5- Enjoy!"

^-- Read that guys. Read it TWICE. ALL OF IT.

Especially the last part concerning the PATCH; because your version of Diablo II is the base version, v1.03 or v1.07; either way, it won't work with mounted .iso's or even with the actually disc *sometimes it won't anyways*. SO PATCH IT, then you are SET TO GO.
