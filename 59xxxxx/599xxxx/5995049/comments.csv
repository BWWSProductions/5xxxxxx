,ojdac,2010-12-01T12:32Z,I downloaded the version update earlier but it unabled me to play because it kept saying steam has to be on or that steam doesn't allow it. i hope this fixes it
,POLICEX,2010-12-01T17:57Z,"this torrent works perfect just extract to a folder like C/Games and thats it all done you have l4d2 updated to 2052 and no need to install any cracks
quite a quick extraction aswell 
thanks Junpoppa
took about 18 hrs to download
not bad for 11gb
:-))"
,POLICEX,2010-12-01T17:59Z,"make sure if you have steam installed to turn it off when playing and probably installing as-well just to be on the safe side
i haven't got steam so i dont know just guessing about the install bit but im sure it causes problems when playing"
,POLICEX,2010-12-02T17:17Z,"i installed source mod meta mod and all that and game stopped working ,im thinking this was my own fault so im reinstalling again and will install sorcemod aswell"
,POLICEX,2010-12-02T18:10Z,"OK wont work with sorcemod

,ojdac,2010-12-03T01:00Z,works perfectly for me. but i still need help with garena.. i get the same steam group servers no matter how i start the game. please help

,nk22,2010-12-04T01:01Z,"Too bad the download was bit slow, otherwise everything works great! Just like it says download extract and play, no cracks no patches or anything. Thanks man :)"
,Mercury8215,2010-12-05T13:58Z,"EVERYONE SHOULD AVOID UPLOADING RAR FILES.  You may think it's more efficient because it saves you bandwidth and space on your hard drive; but think about it!  To use the files the downloaders have to unpack it.  That doubles the amount of space taken up on our hard drives.  Then we install the game, making the hard drive space 3 fold!  

Many people like me, who download and upload a lot have nearly full hard drives.  I promise you, most of the people, again like myself, who seed files a little after the download is complete, DO NOT KEEP UPLOADING RAR FILES.  And it's reasonable not too reseed RAR files, as I've just explained.  Your uploads will be reseeded 10 times more often if you upload ready to use files.  

I'm not trying to be a jerk or anything.  I greatly appreciate the time you take to share files with everyone.  I'm just calling it like I see it.  "
,KrazyK89,2010-12-06T10:05Z,"The game works, but I when I play the SP and exit to the main menu instead the game exits and closes to the desktop?! Also How can I change my name? I've tried ""name myname"" in the console, but it doesn't change?!"
,EvilAsh34,2010-12-07T01:52Z,I'm having the same problem as @KrazyK89. Trying to get back to the main menu after a game always produces a CTD. Otherwise it works perfectly.
,Junpoppa,2010-12-07T09:21Z,"To change your name go to the extracted folder ""l4d2"" open file  ""rev.ini"" and write your desired nickname instead of ""REVOLUTION""

,KrazyK89,2010-12-07T14:16Z,"@Junpoppa

Thanks for letting me how to change my name. Also i'm still having the same problem as EvilAsh34. Is there any fix for this? "

,Junpoppa,2010-12-07T18:01Z,:( sorry but I have no idea since I never had that kind of problem when playing SP. I'd check it out myself but right now I'm in the hospital waiting desperately to go home! and that would happen the day after to-morrow so please bear with it until then :(
,EvilAsh34,2010-12-08T13:16Z,"@Junpoppa

No problem, brother. Get well soon."
,EvilAsh34,2010-12-09T00:41Z,"I think i found the answer for the crash to main menu after a game.

Rev_Emu_hotfix_for_l4d2_v2052
This is a rev-emu hotfix for l4d2 v2052. Extract with 7zip.
It is still buggy ATM: Game will crash if you exit map to main menu.
Game is still playable, but server hosting is not. [use esteamation for servers] 

So, apparently the crashing problem has to do with the 2.0.5.2 Rev_Emu. Currently they are up to v2.0.5.3 so maybe that will help? I'm going to try it and see what happens."

,JoeCorby,2010-12-12T03:48Z,"Hey, whenever I try to launch now, some pop up comes up and says I need to be running ""VSteam"" or something. I have no idea what that is or where to get it... I know it's not the normal ""Steam"", but it was fine earlier..."
,JoeCorby,2010-12-12T03:52Z,"--NVM, just changed a line; however, is there a way to get online correctly? If I click ""Play Online"" it CTDs, and if I click ""Quick Join"" it just seems to load endlessly..."
,Junpoppa,2010-12-13T13:08Z,"JoeCorby
when you run the game and go to the main page, just wait for a minute or two and steam group servers will automatically pop out."
,JoeCorby,2010-12-13T23:01Z,"Oh, you mean the list in the corner? Or something else? Either way, I'll try it; thanks!"
