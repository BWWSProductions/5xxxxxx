Religion
The Debate

In a world of globalization and rapid social change does religion provide the common values and ethical foundations that diverse societies need to thrive in the 21st century?  Or, do deeply held religious beliefs promote intolerance, exacerbate ethnic divisions, and impede social progress in developing and developed nations alike? To encourage a far-ranging discussion on one of human kindâ€™s most vexing questions, the 6th semi-annual Munk Debate will tackle the resolution: be it resolved, religion is a force for good in the world.

Religious faith has a major part to play in shaping the values which guide the modern world, and can and should be a force for progress. 

Christopher Hitchens
If religious instruction were not allowed until the child had attained the age of reason, we would be living in a quite different world.
