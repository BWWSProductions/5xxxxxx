,Genetics,2010-11-29T05:05Z,fuck yeh i've been waiting for this one for a while
[T],jerry7_57,2010-11-29T19:58Z,Thank You!!
,Bit-Step,2010-11-30T01:47Z,oooh this looks interesting..........
,Osmodius,2010-11-30T16:01Z,"Why are these still being split up into two CD-sized files?

Are people really still burning movies to CDs? Wouldn't a single .avi be more convenient for most of the people downloading this?"
,ZenRhino,2010-12-01T01:28Z,"2 things after saying thanks for the up:

1) how can I get the subs to work (I use VSO ConvertXtoDVD) when my app doesn't recognize the .idx files as I try to add them

2) do you have the ""making of"" that followed Restrepo when it aired on NatGeo channel last night? it was awesome!!"
,jhnthn_rogers,2010-12-01T01:33Z,I'VE BEEN THERE AND DONE THAT. THIS MOVIE HITS ME IN THE HEART. I LOVE IT AND I HATE IT BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT THEY ALL HAVE BEEN THROUGH. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS MOVIE.
,henry76,2010-12-01T16:28Z,Thanks :)
,alexman96,2010-12-02T03:05Z,thanks amigo..!!
,mark74872,2010-12-02T03:08Z,"just wondering, at the very start after the ied, the audio cuts out til for like 10 secs. is this the same for everyone or just me"
,060684,2010-12-02T13:27Z,Man I was disappointed. I enjoyed Armadillo waay more than this one. I'll say it's not a bad documentary but it's not good either. It's just ordinary and there is nothing special about it. Not a keeper on my part.
,krizz91,2010-12-02T13:44Z,"@Osmodius: why are you complaining? If you dont want to burn them onto a CD or anything than dont, but for those few ppl who still does they will. And its not like its hard for us to watch 2 CDs, just play them after each other in WMP or VLC."
,BelRabimMarduk,2010-12-03T08:23Z,Ooohh my God finaly it is here. I have been waiting and looking for it for some time now.
,tattu56,2010-12-05T00:58Z,An easier resolve with the Subs (srt) ...here...http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3984951/restrepo-en
,tattu56,2010-12-05T01:02Z,"PS.  just remembered, DON'T click on the ""Download at 25MBIT""  link, it's a ripoff credit card Members only shite site.  "

,billybob45,2010-12-08T11:57Z,"If u look at a torrent & it has no screenshots (for porn) or a link 2 boxcover/official info about it (for films or tvseries etc) 1st search thepiratebay often some1 else uploaded the same file & included screenshots 2nd google it or use imdb.com or wikipedia & then copy&paste links 2 the info you find 2 help everyone , it only takes a few seconds per file (once u found the info) ,the more people stop being selfish  the better off well all be, thepiratebay may not be around forever so help out right now please. Also keep seeding dont just hit and run , seed as fast as your isp lets u upload ,the faster your upload speed the faster your download speed is for recieving data thats how bittorent works !im not a hypocrite sometimes when i go 2 post info tpb says database error failed to write..i dont have time 2  go back 2 the files i couldnt help out on , A good place to get help is http://forum.suprbay.org/index.php report fake files or drm files there.
 ,ps if you look at porn remember to respect women theyre gods greatest creation. torrentday your not doing yourselves any good by releasing torrents you fail to seed why would we bother going to your site if we think you fail to seed so many of your releases ? uploaders always test burn your uploads ! keep titles for each file under 106 characters so popular dvd burning software like roxio works.And always report any child porn you stuble upon to http://www.iwf.org.uk/

,swampmatt,2010-12-09T05:24Z,"Are there any versions of this film that are NOT 5.1 audio?? I have to convert nearly all downloads using ""visual hub"" so they will play on my appleTV. Unfortunately, neither VisualHub nor my AppleTV are able to convert/play files with 5.1 audio.

Any tips on other ways to convert the audio? (for a mac user)
Thanks in advance."

Thank You."
,xiIix,2011-01-08T22:47Z,"AppleTV doesn't support 5.1? Dude that's fuckin disgraceful. Honestly I dunno why people even bother with that piece of trash. There are so many other options that offer more bang for the buck and are much more robust. You can build a media center that is TINY, like literally the size of a netbook, and it would support everything, local and streaming, no matter what it is. 

AppleTV isn't the only microPC out there. And if you wanna even go a little extra and spend a few more bucks, you could get one with an Nvidia Ion GT218 and do some gaming on it as well. Nothing insane but you could run almost any game on it at decent settings.

Everyone I know that has gone super proprietary in the way of home entertainment has met nothing but frustration. Open is the way to go. If you don't want a hassle, then make sure you have control over your hardware and software.

Anyway... As far as your encoding issues, can't you just use a different encoder to convert and downmix the 5.1 into stereo? Shouldn't be too hard to do."

thnx!"
,malleryknox,2011-02-22T09:39Z,"An amazing and heartbreaking doc about what life is really like for soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. After watching it, I have a renewed respect for those who people who serve their country. Even when they come home safe they still have to fight nightmares and demons from their time over there. You guys are fucking heroes man and should be treated as such. I will never take for granted the freedoms I have because of people such as yourselves. Godspeed to each and every one of you."
,Igemo75,2011-03-02T14:30Z,"Nice doc but imho  the Danish ""Armadillo"" is far superior overall. 

And I find the ""gung ho gung ho"" captain quite pathetic to be honest. "
,Igemo75,2011-03-02T14:32Z,"""@swampmatt Get a pc""

or get vlc. Works fine and the movie plays OK on my Mac. I Do have the 10 sec. sound drop at the beginning of the movie, though..."
,Igemo75,2011-03-02T16:46Z,And the numerous semi-gay activities among the unit after a few weeks on the field are quite disturbing and puzzling.
,tonyromano777,2011-04-07T08:43Z,Thank you :-)
,hckrwolf,2011-04-21T00:53Z,"RIP Tim Hetherington, director of ""Restrepo""."

,Slitt,2011-04-21T06:07Z,"@Igemo75 
And that is all you got from that movie, eh? Some Semi-Gay behavior. I guess you don't bond well with men, eh? Maybe a little scared that once u bond you might be exposed for the man-junk-grabber u really are?"
,beedoola,2011-04-21T19:18Z,RIP Tim

,luck702,2011-06-08T01:12Z,"@igemo Fuck, considering what they went through, they can be as gay as they want."
,JakeMl,2011-07-15T07:04Z,"Anyone else having a problem with the color? the whole thing seems like brightish and purple, like some old film effect or something. It's not VLC either"
,Igemo75,2011-07-23T10:44Z,"""And that is all you got from that movie, eh?""

NO! I also discovered that the Danish artsy/documentary movie ""Armadillo"" is FAR FAR superior to this one. "
,shavarma1,2012-01-14T09:37Z,Thanks a lot TV Team - you guys are the greatest !!
,mskd,2012-02-07T01:48Z,"Hey Igemo75. Don't usually write comments but for you I will. Obviously you have never served in the military. Your thinking of gay activity is bonding, which happens when the man beside you is responsible for your life. A bond of trust, love, and understanding no woman will ever approach. It may look gay, but when someone is willing to die for you, is a hug enough? What you see in this film shows you the bond between soldiers, and so much more. If you still think it's gay, I invite you to pick up a rifle, go to war, get shot at, and not hug the MF watching your back. Not willing to pick up a rifle and go to war? Then STFU and thank us who do. "
