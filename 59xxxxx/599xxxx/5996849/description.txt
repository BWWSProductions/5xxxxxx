Mr. Kobialka plays his fiddle (oops, violin) like you have never heard before...
it's like a small bird, flying up higher and higher,
singing the birdsong on the sweetflowing notes shifting up higher and higher...
Those haunting and so often sad melodies,
a lonesome mando walking hand by hand with violin on the endless way to nowhere...
With help of prominent guest musicians an acoustic music masterpiece was born,
which unfortunately didn't found its so-much deserved way into wider attention...

(acoustic evergreen folk, swing, bluegrass traditionals @ violin, mandolin & band)
