From Treasure Island Media (T.I.M.) - Christian, 24 Cocks in 24 Hours

Based on the TIM model established by Dawsons 20-Load Weekend, TIMs new title focuses on studio exclusive Christian, who vows to take as much cock as he can within a single day. Christian: 24 Cocks in 24 Hours also features Brandon Aquilar, Dimitri Santiago, Jay Scorpio, Tony Serrano, Kevin Slater, Luke Thomas, Kurt Wood and TIM exclusive James Roscoe.

Treasure Island has always been successful with us, and the hard-hitting films with their exclusive models have always performed really well, AEBNs Chris Baker said. Christian: 24 Cocks in 24 Hours will follow in that tradition, guaranteed. Its an instant classic.

According to TIM General Manager Matt Mason, we are proud to be at the forefront of innovative and incendiary filmmaking, and this one is no exception. AEBN is a great way for us to reach the even wider audience Christian: 24 Cocks in 24 Hours deserves.
