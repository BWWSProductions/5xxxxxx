mattyboi1995 NOTES
Ok, so id like to thank INK for doing the audio and what a good job he done :) I dropped into vdub, i used 2 de-noise filters on high settings. Then i increased the contrast and saturation, i also used a RGB EQ, then finaly i sharpened. Its not the best cam ive seen but then again its not the worse. The audio is much better than the original audio but thats all down to ink. (he is awesome at what he does)
