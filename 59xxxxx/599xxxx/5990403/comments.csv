,artifex223,2010-11-29T17:40Z,"Yes, I had the same buggy control problem. Set my graphics properties as low as they would go, and the game runs smooth enough now. Computer should be able to handle it, but I guess it's a common problem.

Unfortunately, though, the game crashes during the 2099 portion of the introductory level every time. I know others are having this same problem... Any insights?"
,swaynie,2010-11-30T01:10Z,"i have mine set to the lowest of the low and still i get control issues

,garryzen,2010-11-30T17:47Z,well i am not having any problems wid  crashes or controls its running smoothly  on high settings ! and also working properly wid xbox 360 gamepad
,Ryan2808,2010-11-30T20:45Z,"Game works fine, No problems downloaded fairly quickly although the speed was 500kb for 80% and last 20% was dragged down to about 70kb



ON THE OTHER HAND: Game! is awful.. if your still going to download after this then prepare for disappointment.

Typical game.. kill lots of little guys which then follows by killing a bigger guy done. thats it repetitive rubbish

SHIT GAME!"

,fackelmann_,2010-12-04T22:02Z,"Best Spider-man game ever made? No shit. From all the comments I read (no freerunning and shitty gameplay) I can say the best Spidey game ever is Web of Shadows. Yes, i has it's own problems, but if SD is really that shitty, buggy and screwd up, it can't beat Web of Shadows. 
It's true that we must not complain about it, since we haven't paid, but I guess developpers were just talking too much. "
,Mr.Anon,2010-12-05T01:12Z,"Installation went smoothly. Pasted in the crack.
Now, here's the problem:
When I try to fire up the game, nothing happens. I can see ""Game.exe"" appearing in the Task Manager for a couple seconds, but it just seems to crash immediately.

My computer should be able to handle it fine...so I'm a little confused about the cause of the problem. 

I've reinstalled it and tried it again, but no deal.

Can anyone suggest a course of action I should take?

Much appreciated."
,no1453,2010-12-05T05:07Z,Mine does the same as Mr.Anon's above.  My platform is win7 64bit.

,Omochao,2010-12-05T17:08Z,"correction to my last post, the game works. crash was caused by msn. game works fine but its the controls that are the only gimp for me. worth downloading"

,equazcion,2010-12-13T11:10Z,"For anyone having video problems, I solved mine by turning off any forced video card settings (set ATI Catalyst settings to ""let the application decide"", not sure what the nVidia equivalent is). 

I had all settings forced to highest before, and the game would barely play at 1 FPS. Highest settings work well as long as they're set in the game options, not in the video card driver. 

Hope that helps.

,eNdEmiOn06463,2010-12-16T03:05Z,"I have a problem at the Carnage level. When I get to the top of the circular tower, the game starts loading the next part (final battle with carnage I guess) indefinitely. Anyone else got this problem. Rest of the game not a single problem or error or what so ever.

p.s. I've noticed that the dynamical fanspeed control of most recent videocards is pretty bad for keeping ur card cool enough to function properly. Customized gpu bios fancontrol with nibitor much better."

,mental222,2010-12-19T18:21Z,"and yeah, one more thing, if you started the game, and it shows a black blank screen. ok, wait for some minutes, maybe for 15-20 mins. It'll start later. and if it does not start for, maybe an hour, ok, now there is something wrong."
,mental222,2010-12-19T18:44Z,"and one more thing, if you launched your game and it only shows a black blank screen, ok wait for about 15-20 minutes, trust me, it'll start after that. and it'll start normally from that on. And, if the game does not start if you wait, maybe almost for an hour, NOW you have issues."
