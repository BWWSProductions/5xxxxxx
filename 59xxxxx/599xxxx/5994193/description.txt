Label: Prestige
Format:MP3@320



THE COMPLETE PRESTIGE RECORDINGS features sessions headed by Coleman Hawkins, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins, Monk & Rollins and Miles Davis.

Recorded between 1952 and 1954.r]

There isn't much from Thelonious Monk's pre-1960s catalogue that isn't worth listening to, and though the pianist/composer's tenure at Prestige was fairly short-lived (1952-1954), and the output is less essential than either his Blue Note recordings or his definitive work for Riverside, this music is still outstanding. Disc One's first four tracks actually date back to 1944, when Monk made his first Prestige appearance as a sideman for Coleman Hawkins. From here the timeline jumps to sessions from '52-'53 that feature Monk in various ensemble configurations including quartets, quintets, and trios.

Top-drawer players--including bassist Percy Heath, tenor man Sonny Rollins, and drummers Max Roach and Art Blakey--appear on these dates, with the bold push-and-pull between Monk and Rollins making the biggest impression. Disc Three focuses on the one session that ever found Monk and trumpet legend Miles Davis sharing a studio (due to personal and aesthetic differences the two subsequently steered clear of each other), with excellent and sensitive playing all around. At three discs, The Complete Prestige Recordings might seem skimpy compared to other "complete" sets, but the size makes the listening quite manageable, and the caliber of the playing is consistently high throughout.
