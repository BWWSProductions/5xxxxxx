 Much Appreciated. This was a Great Fishing Game if I Recall. Albeit for the Flat Textures of THEN Dx7, they did a great job on on the Fish I thought, Plus Easy/Simple Controls, Camera, Good Sound Effects, Mood and all...
Fun Game, Glad Someone Remembered it."

E verything was fine until you went to actually play the game. As soon as you get into it (you on a boat) - it crashes right there.

 Running win7 too btw.

 Oh well thx for the upload, probably just a compatibility issue."
