In the beginning was music - house and techno, 
and they ignored it, but it became bigger and people of all nations came together in order to dance, 
they called it a hype and said it was over, 
but it still developed and it grew into a movement. 

Now they try to forbid it, but they can\\\'t stop it. 
Forward ever. 
Backward never...
