Nicholas Stoller

Comedy | Drama | Music | Romance

Plot:
Peter is a composer and a likable sad sack who's devastated when his girlfriend of five years,
Sarah Marshall, the star of a cheesy CSI-style crime show, dumps him. He weeps, he rails,
he mopes. Finally, his step-brother Brian suggests Hawaii, so Peter heads for a resort on Oahu
where, as he's checking in, he sees Sarah and her new beau, Aldous, a polymorphously perverse
English rocker. The weeping and moping start again, until Peter is rescued by Rachel,
a thoughtful hotel clerk who invites him to a luau and to hang out. Although he constantly
runs into Sarah and Aldous, Peter starts to come alive again. Will Sarah realize what she's
lost, and what about Rachel?
