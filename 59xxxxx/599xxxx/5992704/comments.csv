Oh en what's up met de resolutie? 720 X 576? Da's bijna vierkant is dat met zwarte balken boven en onder of is daar veel af gesneden? Of had het 276 moeten zijn?"

,soupcip,2010-11-28T16:40Z,"pietjepaulusboskabouter, please do some research before you post silly questions on every harry potter release. 720 X 576 is THE standard resolution for pal-encoded dvd content.
And as this is a ts 2 DVD rip at 25 fps anyone with the slightest knowledge can deduce this is pal dvd format, so the ONLY resolution you'll want is 720 X 576. Mygodz stick to weatherforecasting !"

,jeeba901,2010-12-03T14:04Z,im checking it out 
,lucasdr,2010-12-12T11:57Z,"C'mon guys; to open an ISO file, you either mount an image with deamon tools. In this case a virtual disc will appear as if you had an extra DVD-player installed.
Or you can unpack the files with a program like WinRAR. 
After that you need a video player, like VLC or the CCCP-pack to open the video files (just open VIDEO_TS)"
