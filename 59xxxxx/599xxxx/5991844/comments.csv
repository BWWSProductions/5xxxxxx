,Medevila,2011-01-15T21:44Z,This man speaks the truth. Titles are screwed up.
,CM24,2011-01-31T14:09Z,"Way to point out the songs are in the wrong order but not post the correct order!!!

Anyway the tracklisting is as follows (just rename the titles):
1. So Far Away
2. Money For Nothing
3. Walk of Life
4. Sultants of Swing
5. Your Latest Trick
6. Brothers in Arms
7. Why Worry
8. Down to the Waterline
9. Tunnel of Love
10. Romeo & Juliet
11. One World
12. Private Investigations

Peace."
