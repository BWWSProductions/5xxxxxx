Subtitles: None
Date: 2010.11

Director:
James K. Shea

Genres:
Sci-Fi | Drama 

Plot: When a spaceship full of hairy people crashes on an unknown planet, it's not enough 
that the surviving members look a lot like the Starland Vocal Band (it is a help, of course, 
but not sufficient for their survival). They must forge off on a non-stop mission of 
wandering around doing nothing in particular, not saying anything particularly noteworthy, 
and not looking particularly attractive or interesting. However, they do provide a tasty 
and nutritious snack for some pretty sweet looking stop-motion dinosaurs! Their routine 
deaths become a challenge to their intrepid captain, who prefers to rule by whining, 
equivocation and frequent "rest periods." This leaves him vulnerable to a coup by the 
crew's most hirsute member, Jim, who presses the enormous advantage provided him by what 
looks like a beard made out of 2-dollar-a-yard fun fur. 

Kevin, Bill and Mike sharpen some sticks, put on their least smelly animal furs and prepare 
to poke at the Planet of Dinosaurs.
