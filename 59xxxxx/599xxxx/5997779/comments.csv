,soupcip,2010-11-30T03:06Z,"The same problem I had when I recoded the TS to be a bit higher in contrast en a little less in brightness(amongst other tweaks) ; it looks nice at first but actually it results in less detail in dark parts, and there are alot, and also the picture gets more grainy and just less detailed overall.
I for one think the Imagine TS looks better then this one, in the comparison look at the jacket (middle, in the back). the sleeve looks much more natural in the Imagine rip, less blocky, grainy. I guess there will be a thousand of these out , all a tiny bit different, before the dvd comes out lol."
