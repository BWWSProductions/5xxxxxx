,klainmesh2,2010-12-02T02:43Z,"Hello Sceneline,

Can you find ""The Tourist"" 2010 movie. Its a very good movie. Please Rip It.

:D"
,mma4me,2010-12-02T03:07Z,"Keep those aXXo rips coming sceneline, I've seen the quality and I believe you. Remember haters like to hate. Just d/l the movie and the quality is there.  "
,sole420,2010-12-04T11:35Z,"If you truly are legit which I seriously doubt, then what reason do you have for using some one elses name?  If your files aren't fake then use YOUR OWN name.  Downloaders who know are going to react in similar fashion.  Come on man...."
,knandan,2010-12-27T13:42Z,people instead of fighting whether or not axxo has gone.. why dont you download the movie instead and comment on its quality. it would help a lot of users.
,vtskge,2011-02-07T03:36Z,Thank you Sceneline for this movie... My children loved it.  Was awesome great quality and sound was great too.  Thumbs up.

,godofwrath08,2011-02-12T02:06Z,"y dnt u use your own name instead as the codecs used on your movies is loads different than the one used with aXXo's rips, hes gone no need to keep the old name going sum1 needs to fill the gap left by him. "
,Imaloser2,2011-02-20T08:37Z,"Quality is great =)
But it's not aXXo... if you're gonna make a rip use your own name...
Btw Thanks.

,Imaloser2,2011-02-20T08:42Z,"By the way (sorry about the double post) godofwrath08 is right, someone needs to fill the gap. Use your own name and keep the good rips coming."
