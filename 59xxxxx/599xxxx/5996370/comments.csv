,ekarth22,2010-11-30T03:57Z,does it deal with hardware repair or only software part??
[V],Raider,2010-11-30T08:18Z,"Well the word ""REPAIR"" would certainly be Hardware for If it was only software the word troubleshooting would have been in place...
though not checked but it should be the hardware & software repair in total."

,pirato_se,2011-01-17T21:45Z,yeah its from 1999 so if they start talking about 32 mb video cards dont get surprised...
