,trntz_man,2010-11-29T20:51Z,"First of all, thank you DibyaTPB for taking the time to upload both 720p and 1080p versions Enter the Void for the torrent community. 
Also, I apologize for the multi-post on all hd versions of ETV. 

I was wondering if there are anyone has received the French Blu-ray yet. It has been stated that the French Blu-ray will have both the theatrical cut and the ""alternative edition"" (Director's Cut w/ runtime: 174 min) of the movie which includes the famous missing 'Reel 7' which wasn't included in the original theatrical release. 

The French blu-ray comes out on December 1, while us Americans get it Jan 25."
