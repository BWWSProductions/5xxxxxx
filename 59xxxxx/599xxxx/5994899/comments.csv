,bhadrra,2011-05-02T00:20Z,hey! i'm new to piratebay but not sure how to download lol!any cute guys willing to add me on yahoo messenger my screename is HyacinthRettig976 
,m8cet,2011-05-21T05:21Z,"yea its a good collection, but didnt get what's interactive in the whole thing. it looks a set of plain pdfs and that too scanned without using ocr. i mean these are normal scanned pdf where u cant select the text. am i missing out something here? by the way the books are extremely good, i am really enjoying them on my laptop, probably quite a rare piece of torrent. so a load of thanks to the uploader....only if u cud explain the interactive thing, that wud have been even better..."
,Lucifer007,2011-05-21T10:14Z,Thank You So Much. Cheerio!

,pulkit007,2011-07-21T09:38Z,Great Job Mate !
,738arrow,2011-08-09T01:57Z,Any other insights into the interactive side of the pdfs? As noted above I can't see how they're interactive on the computer... ? I am yet to test it on the tablet.
,bokehjoe,2011-09-09T09:28Z,"738arrow et al.

I dont know this to be fact- but I would bet that PDF was not the format that was native to what NatGeo put out.  The original format was probably interactive- but someone- maybe the ul'er, converted them to a format compatible to folks with e-readers- and not pads. 

That would be my best guess."
,bokehjoe,2011-09-09T09:31Z,"I almost Forgot! 

Thanks a million sonilem for the upload!  I really enjoy pretty much anything NatGeo does. 

Thanks Again!"
,nomad169,2011-12-20T07:13Z,Thanks man for the upload
,nomad169,2011-12-23T06:45Z,"Thanks mate for the upload. As others said its not interactive and in some pdfs the pages have been repeated.

Also some pages are below average quailty. and when i say some pages i mean more than 100 in total.

Anyways thanks. I'll start collecting this magazine from now on."
