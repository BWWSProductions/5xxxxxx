        Ashley has been on her own  all her life. She feels even  more
        alone this Christmas  as she searches  fruitlessly for a  job.
        The seasonal cheer around her only rubs salt in the wounds  as
        she scrapes by to support  herself and her dog, dash.  But her
        neighbour, Nick, knows  exactly how to  help. He offers  her a
        job to  be his  assistant in  he best  work -  helping others.
        There's one catch  Ashley must honour  though: she can't  tell
        anyone that  her new  boss is  a sort  of secret Santa helping
        others anonymously. Through her new job, Ashley meets Will,  a
        writer for a  magazine who uncovers  what Ashley is  doing and
        more importantly Nick's involvement.  As Ashley and Nick  help
        people in need, Ashley tries to protect Nick's secret and  her
        own heart, while Will must  weigh the consequences of what  he
        does.
