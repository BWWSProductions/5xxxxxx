,theoangelo,2010-12-12T22:09Z,"BUT OF COURSE, THANKS FOR THE UPLOAD "
,theartpirate,2010-12-31T05:25Z,"@theoangelo= WTF? if you want to give people credit for making this then go BUY the series. Reading their names at the end will help no one.

Thanks for the upload dude."

,Dragonite_9,2011-06-01T00:52Z,"@theoangelo

Do you mean the end credits are gone, and you want that?

Or do you mean the names of the .avi files, credit to those who created the .avi file? (e.g. LOL, FQM)

The file name I agree that I want to know the original names, for subtitle purpose just, otherwise great that episode names show, love that!
For END CREDITS, I do not mind most of the time, sometimes it would be great to see a special guest star who you want the name of or so, if not listed in beginning, but that vs. the saved space is imo better to cut end credit of, since you easy can look it up on the webb!


@crakhed32 and N3tw0rkbomb3r (s01 torrent, said, can not believe what people acctually are writing in these torrents, they had now seen it all, regarding theoangelo's comment)


Haha, yepp, so true! Sometimes I can not believe what people have the nerve to write to them (us) who up load stuff!! Incredible what morons there is out there who are really mean and behave like fucking idiots with rude nonsense commentary's or complaints about the up load, or up loader! Makes me sick these people, have the nerve to complaint about what we up loaders do FOR FREE for them so they can download it FOR FREE, and yet we just get shit and fucking retarded personal verbal attacks !!!
(Great example, just look at my torrents, for example, Men in Black...).

Take care! (And thx proxyjon for the effort done of up loading something!) "

,Saki33,2011-09-19T05:35Z,"I also like it better if it has the end credits, but I am not going to be pissed if it doesn't. No one answered to the question so I will instead download Konashine. I watched the 720p first season and that version did have the end credits. If you want end credits download that one instead. And thanks to all the uploaders, credits or not."
,Saki33,2011-09-19T18:58Z,"I will answer the question. This one does retain the end credits. That's good. The quality is also good. On a show like this 720p isn't really needed and hard to tell the difference anyway. But, in episode 1 the recap of previous season is missing at the beginning. If (like I) you have just finished season one you won't need it. If you want the recap you'll need to download the 720p version.

Thanks again. I think I'll just save some space and download this version."
,Saki33,2011-09-19T21:01Z,"I also downloaded episode 2 for both 720p and this version. The good news for those who like credits is that yes, credits are still included with this version. However, for those who like to also have those recaps at the beginning, you'll need the 720p version. Personally, I prefer having it with the recaps."
,cartman19987,2011-09-30T15:54Z,"I honestly couldn't care less about end credits. No offense, but why do uploaders choose to omit them? Thanks very much for the great upload."
,enltguy,2011-11-28T08:41Z,"Actually, as someone who works in film, most people in the crew (if not all) don't get points.   So credit is all we can hope for after our daily pay.  So buying it versus torrenting it doesn't really make a difference.  The producers have already made off with enough money, and the actors generally aren't hurting in a production of this status.  Just sayin'.  So not that any of you would know who I am (at this point - though I act as well and just did a major feature), or know who any of those others names are, but watching the credits and recognizing those people that put in the hours upon hours OFF set, is much appreciated.  You've got no fucking clue how much time can spent dealing just with extras, for example. Thank you!!"

,spifkitten99,2012-05-19T18:55Z,"Don't cut the fucking credits.

I don't give a shit about giving credit to people, and I don't care about watching them either, but they are part of the video, so don't fucking ruin the video, by cutting out stuff, that YOU don't think is important.

It's simply incomplete, and there is not one single valid reason to cut it.

Don't give me shit about file size. The tiny difference that it makes, has absolutely no relevance."
,Wamphire,2012-06-19T01:26Z,"Not that I care but kind of wondering how someone can wake up one morning with the idea to cut the end credits on this kind of file.

Surely it can't be for the 2 or 3MB saved on the size... that would be quite ridiculous.

Anyway, thanks for the up. ;)"
