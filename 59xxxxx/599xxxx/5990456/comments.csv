,QueenAmnesia,2010-11-28T15:31Z,"Yepp same problem here buttons - no matter if mouse/keyboard or gamepad - arent reacting properly.
You have to hit them many time until the game reacts.
Since i didnt find anything online it seems it isnt a bug in the ""normal"" version of this game - so we have to buy it OR some smart ones find out where it lacks and release a fixed version.

Well maybe its just a bug for some people with special system specs or something since not everyone seems to have that problem though O.o"
,vodrok,2010-11-30T16:50Z,"you know, I got this issue with the buttons too and I haven't found anyone else with the problem beside us..."

,DarthUnderverse,2010-12-01T19:36Z,"Same problem here with the buttons being unresponsive. Windows xp pro, ati radeon hd 4350, 4 gigs ram. Almost certain this is a crack issue, The game itself runs perfectly fine with settings on high, but even at minimum graphics the buttons just don't work properly. After viewing other torrents and sites, this problem is quite widespread. Any help at all would be appreciated."

I mean, after they show madam web and then spidey swinging away, my screen turns black, and then I land on my desktop with the error ""Windows is looking for a solution to the problem"" and then comes ""Windows will notify you when the solution is available"" or something like that and it just shows ""Close Program"" button.. Can anyone tell me what's going wrong?! I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate 34bit on a Dell Vostro1015 laptop. My software drivers are all up-to-date.. Please some one help! I hope you've got the solution which apparently Microsoft can't find.. :( I spent a week on downloading this! thanks to my pathetic internet speed... and after 7 days I get only 1.30 seconds of this?! .. .. that's soo not what I had in mind.. :( please help !!

,kimoalexandru,2012-01-08T16:37Z,"i found a fix for the control problems (it works for me)  1.Disable your antivirus while playing the game.
2.Run your program as Administrator.
3.If this don t works, set your graphic settings lower. 
(or at minimum.)
4.Update: Dx.,Download the latest drivers for your computer.
5.IF ALL OF THOSE DON T WORK Try using Gamebooster while playing the game.Set your computer s settings at minimum,and disable the desktop icons and gadgets before entering in the game.
 I AM NOT SURE IF THIS WILL WORK FOR YOU GUYS BUT IT WORKED FOR ME(DOWNLOAD THIS VERSION EXTREMEZONE) 

THX. EXTREMEZONE FOR ALL YOUR EFFORTS!!!!!!
