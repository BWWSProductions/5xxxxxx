Hey Guys! sorry I had to delete previous torrent so I uploaded new one!

This is the latest release, which updates Left 4 dead 2 v 2.0.5.1 to v 2.0.5.2

That means that you MUST have left 4 dead 2 v 2.0.5.1, otherwise this update 

won't work on any other version of the game.(Download my uploaded v 2.0.5.1 but do  

not follow the steps written there, just simply extract it.)

(Those who have already downloaded and played v 2.0.5.1 start from step zero)

(Those who are downloading it now start from step 1)

Step0. Uninstall "RevEmu_2050+"
