,neildunne,2010-12-01T01:08Z,Does anybody know what 3D format this is? Is it side by side? anaglyph?.......Thanks guys
,LigGeorge,2010-12-01T05:56Z,Side by side.
,neildunne,2010-12-01T15:45Z,"LigGeorge.......Is there any chance you could seed for a little longer please, everybodys stuch at 86.1%. Its just until a few of us have downloaded 100% then we can seed also

B.T.W............Thanks for the 3d rip of How To Train Your Dragon, its fantastic quality mate :-)"
,LigGeorge,2010-12-01T16:09Z,Sorry for the delay.
,jamesworts,2010-12-08T21:28Z,"Watch out for this one, yes it is good quality, however if you are downloading to stream directly to your samsung 3d tv, you will need to remux it!!

I will try and save you all the agro and up load one that has already had the work done!

not sure what good this is to anyone in this format with seperate audio, obviously if i have got this wrong please feel free to say so!"
,LigGeorge,2010-12-09T05:52Z,"Remuxing is very easy.I do that because dts audio is VERY good and up to 7.1 channels.Compare it if you want.
I am thinkink though to put mp4 inside and dts seperate to reduce the size of the video file."
,jamesworts,2010-12-09T19:58Z,"Yeah thats cool fella, as i said I am probably wrong! lol.

So the file you have uploaded (mkv) if i put that on external drive and plug into my 3D telly i should be able to hear the 7.1 audio with out muxing the mp4 into it??
"
,LigGeorge,2010-12-09T21:06Z,"Only ""How to train your dragon"" has 7.1 channels (dts).From a media pc with a proper graphic card like 6870 with hdmi 1.4,I believe that you can hear 7.1 channels."
,LigGeorge,2010-12-10T05:35Z,"Sorry ,how to train your dragon has 7.1 DD not dts"

,LigGeorge,2011-03-12T22:56Z,"Basicly it's a 3d tv.Really,you can play it directly from a usb stick.
Also you could read comments from other 3d torrents before start insulting me."
