Sergey Makovetsky as Uncle Vanya

In Rimas TuminasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Uncle Vanya there is no daily routine life but only its symbols. Here Voinitsky calls out of the fog of the past shadows of already gone people in order to understand where he made a mistake, at what moment his life got derailed and if there is a chance to make a clean copy of it. He even lapses into day-dreaming and starts thinking that they are real people. He shoots at Serebryakov who goes towards him with arms wide open. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“MissedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, Voinitsky is astonished. He tries to embrace Elena Andreevna but she disregards him with the disgust of a ghost that is sick and tired of human spirit. At the finale the shadows get melted away in the fog, taking with them the medium himself. Sergei Makovetsky plays the part of Voinitsky. He is a grand actor, so when he comes on the stage you must be prepared for everything. But still, you become dumbfounded when you see how Voinitsky stiffens in the middle of the stage at the finale. Sonya by force opens his eyes and stretches a smile on his numb face. And he backs away and disappears in the past as well.
One of the main theatres of the country, the Vakhtangov Theatre, has been among outsiders recently, failing to find its director. The situation started changing when the Ministry of Culture RF invited the Lithuanian Rimas Tuminas to head the theatre. Over the last two years he has made several important premiers here but Uncle Vanya is the most amazing and unexpected production among them. On the one hand, TuminasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s production seems to be assigned to demonstrate the traditions of the Vakhtangov School of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“fantastic realismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ that once used to be opposite to the MKhAT ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“school of emotionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. On the other hand, in the competition of the two schools Tuminas fights his rival with its own weapon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Chekhov.

Elena Kovalskaya


This never grown-up but already aged child, ingenuous and naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve, every moment ready to be ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“punishedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Uncle Vanya seems to argue with the last yearsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ theatre tendency that is accusatory of the protagonist. MakovetskyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s character is a nice blunderer, a very sincere and pure person. The pattern of his role is seemingly simple but it is actually difficult: only a very big actor can justify it, and Mr Makovetsky is precisely this. After the final monologue that was recited more like damnation rather than consolation Sonya makes out of her compliant uncle a mannequin with straddling arms, wide open eyes and an unnaturally stretched smile. Uncle Vanya spent his life with eyes wide-shut; he meets death - the darkness where he goes to can only mean that - with eyes wide-open.

Generally speaking, Tuminas made quite a simple thing. He presented all the characters of the play, from Serebryakov to Voinitsky without exception, as unlucky people overcoming their complexes (everyone does it in his/her own way). He uncovered and enlarged this hidden theme of ChekhovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s play. The plain Sonya (Maria Berdinskikh) feels the burden of her plainness; the habitual drunkard Astrov (Vladimir Vdovichenkov) suffers from everybodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“deafnessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ to his evidently absurd forest ideas; Waffles (Yuri Kraskov) gets rid of his isolation. Uncle Vanya (Serguei Makovetsky) himself gets rid of his dream ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ he wants to be like Schopenhauer but more resembles Waffles. The aged, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“hit in his head with a dusty sackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and never grown up boy who cannot possibly become a manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ The scenic caricatures set to music by Faustas Latenas partly remind divertissement or a sort of freaksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ parade that have to live under the same roof with each other. But from time to time these freaks reveal something different from their complexes. Some enlightennessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦
