All the other dozen and a half shows I've been following didn't have problems. I would like your input. EZTV, A10 V10 everytime! Thank you so much for the 1.3 Terrabytes I got from you all these years!"
,Tivoism,2010-11-29T14:12Z,10th fraking crash on this torrent. What could possibly be wrong with this upload? My normal 18 minutes per 550 mb dl time has turned into 4 fraking hours and counting.

@JRdeb58, you can buy a 30 euros DVB-T Card for your PC, you can record anything playing on your PC, if the file is too large, you can use ""Any Video Converter"" free edition to resize it! http://www.any-video-converter.com/de/index-free-video-converter.php"

You provide so much shit I cancelled my dvr and cable service, every show I watch you provide. Even though I don't comment on every torrent ( I always forget my username and password) which I should, I want to thankyou for all the work you put in to provide this. All your video and audio quality are legit, and you give the option to download better quality files or ones that take up less space, thanks."
