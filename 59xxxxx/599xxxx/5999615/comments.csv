,x360videos,2010-12-01T17:04Z,"Xbox 360 has trouble playing some AVI files without the correct audio settings. 
Mp4 however comes with mainly 2.1 Channel which Xbox 360 supports when playing data discs. 

Also the Xbox Live media update is specifically for MPEG-4 files. So every mp4 file plays. 
Some AVI files play on the xbox but only play for a certain amount of time then come up with an error. "
