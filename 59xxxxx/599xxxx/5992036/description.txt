These two albums are long out of print.  You can still find the cds from $60-$90 though.  The band had some conflict with Sony and their music was never released digitally.  Ive never seen these albums uploaded anywhere.

The vinyl is 30 years old and has been played on many of my turntables through the years so its not in pristine condition.

Classic 80s New Wave/Pop.

I can upload this in FLAC if anyone is interested. Just let me know.

No voodoo computer post-processing hiss, cick/pop, music removal programs were used... I sat there and inserted a track number during the recording.  Ripped with EAC and converted to MP3 (320kps) using Switch Sound Plus.

This is for my Brother and the memory of NC, TCBY and Nakamichi.......
