Unrar'ed, mounted, installed, language in spanish. Did not patch it, did the english settings in options.bat, still in spanish. Did 1-4 and 1-5 and 1-2, still nothing. Every time I do the registry option, (1 then 4 in options.bat), it gives me some error then runs some spanish file. Yes, I reinstalled and tried doing everything again, and same thing... God I hate this.  


Yeah same problem here I don't speak Spanish

,DzReaperz,2012-02-27T06:35Z,Does online gameplay work for this pls comment back because i don't get if you need hamachi or something to go online and the multi player is totally awesome!!!
,DzReaperz,2012-02-27T06:36Z,fds
,DzReaperz,2012-02-27T06:37Z,g
,DzReaperz,2012-02-27T06:39Z,"Do you need somekind of program in order to go online, ( Like Hamachi or Steam ) Or is that just instantly inside when you download it?"
,JuniorSantana93,2012-02-29T19:54Z,"Nice, Aproved very high speed :)"
,ButterBUTTS,2012-03-06T02:03Z,IT WORKS GREAT! But I had the language problem but after awhile I figured it out! What you can do is go the gears main folder then click options to change to english and if that doesn't work then in that same folder go to the binaries folder and delete the lang text file then everything turns english. It worked for me I hope it works for you all.
,xLiDDyx,2012-03-15T13:49Z,"I can't get this to run at all.
Mounted it with PowerISO, Daemon Tools and when I run the Set up, the terminal window opens then closes and nothing happens.

Tried to burn it to disk with Nero and it said that it wasn't a valid Nero image file.

Any ideas?"
