"How Munched is That Birdie in the Window

When a pigeon flies through the Simpsons' 
home and suffers a broken wing, Bart makes 
it his duty to care for the bird whom he 
names Ray, and nurse it back to health. When 
Ray is ready to fly, Homer decides to enter 
him in a bird race when Danica Patrick 
(guest voicing as herself) appears to him in 
a dream. Things don't go according to plan, 
however, when Santa's Little Helper swallows 
Ray. Worried that Bart needs some help 
getting over the loss, Marge and Homer take 
him to a therapy session with Dr. Thurston 
(guest voice Weisz), who advises that the 
only cure for Bart's blues is to give away 
the family dog. But when the Simpsons visit 
the pup's new home, a shock causes them to 
rethink their decision
