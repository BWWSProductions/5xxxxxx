When making your profile in game, switch the type of profile from ""create/recover internet profile"" to ""local profile"".  I didn't see it at first either."

,Xthlon,2010-12-03T07:48Z,"it seems some people just arnt meant for torrents...

1st Read all the comments before you post crap...
2nd Make sure your PC isnt useless before posting crap...
3rd if it doesnt work... insulting while asking for help doesnt get you help... crap... (it needed crap at the end like the others...)

works fine for me... =D"

,DaN00berz,2010-12-13T10:15Z,"@mscollins, I'm having the same prob bro.. It brings me back to the desktop and without the process being found in task manager. Is that the crack exe prob?? Because i can't work with the 'naild_activator.exe'.. everytime it says key generated but it does nothing except making me press any key to end it.. How do I work with that??

thanks"
,DaN00berz,2010-12-13T10:20Z,"@ronaldo18, dude, read 'Likeadidas95''s comment, he said it runs well at 22+fps maxed out with the 9400GT, so your 9800GT will have no prob!!

,coarastaman,2011-01-14T00:09Z,"anyone having the problem of the loading screen being upside down, or not being able to name your local profile? i try enter a name but all that is displayed is a nameless profile, i can play the game, though. oh, yes, i can't see anything during the race: no display of my place among the racers so i never know whether i am first or last, ,  there is no speed display, or anything, really. i am able to play but unable to see anything else. help, please?"
