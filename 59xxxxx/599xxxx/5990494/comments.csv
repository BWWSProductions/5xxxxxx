,a_Meanie,2010-11-27T16:09Z,is this like extra scenes that r not in the extended cut?
[V],GoodFilms,2010-11-27T16:21Z,Read what is says above. It is mostly previously unseen material.
,X3MEX,2010-11-27T17:07Z,let me rephrase; are any of these deleted scenes get included in the extended cut?
[V],GoodFilms,2010-11-27T17:47Z,"Read what is says above. ""the runtime is roughly 68 minutes, but only 45 minutes is new."" That is 45 minutes of of material that was not included in any cut. I hope this is clear enough for you..."
