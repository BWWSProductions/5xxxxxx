,ATOMbombb,2011-08-03T17:05Z,Complete discography? Did you happen to forget their first and greatest album: Bad Music For Bad People?
,brassmonkey001,2011-09-24T22:41Z,"ATOMbombb - I think you'll find Bad Music was their 5th album and was a ""best of"" complilation.
I ordered it at great cost from the States when it was released without seeing a track listing, only to find there was only one track (Uranium Rock) which I didn't already have. 
So, it's not my favourite album. :D"
