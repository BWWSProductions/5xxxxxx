This is the second version of my collection of Star Trek documentaries. It is by no means exhaustive, but there are many documentaries here that were missing from the previous version. All in all - 38 hours of Trek-related television.

I make no claim for credit on any of these. This is just a collection of various video files from the Internet. My only contribution is that I collected these and uploaded the torrent. Thus, any thanks should go to the folks that took the time to rip and/or record these shows (and in some cases - acted, wrote, edited and directed these shows) and upload them in the first place. I'm just "spreading the love". 


Enjoy and Seed!!
