,Fezman92,2011-03-21T03:45Z,"Watching ""Rose"" and there are some big audio issues. The big one is that there is background noise. You can hear people talking and stuff."

,dgilpin22,2011-09-07T18:31Z,Season 6 is still currently being shown on television. Can only find single episodes. They are currently on episode 10 airing sept 10th
,vyache,2011-09-14T05:58Z,"Looking for Season 6? You've got to type out ""Doctor"" instead of ""Dr"" in the search bar. Just figured that out after weeks of frustration."
,HeatherMarMal,2011-09-26T17:45Z,"Brilliant torrent, except The End of Time Part 2 seems to be missing."
,HeatherMarMal,2011-09-26T18:48Z,"Sorry, Part 1 and 2."

,bvorak,2012-03-03T06:12Z,This is brilliant!
,cl0ckwerk,2012-03-06T12:11Z,"Great torrent. I had no problems with any of the videos and they're all great quality. Unfortunately the torrent is missing a few things. It doesn't contain either of the ""Children in Need"" specials (Just short little bits for charity that aren't necessary to the plot, but fun to watch anyway). It is also missing all of the specials between seasons 4 and 5 except The Waters of Mars, but the one in the torrent is awfully low quality. They are all available on TPB if you search for them by name. They are: The Next Doctor, Planet of the Dead, and The End of Time (parts 1 and 2). If I were you, I would download a different version of The Waters of Mars as well (this is also available on TPB if you search for it by name). Aside from that, great torrent. And don't forget, when looking for season 6, do as vyache mentioned earlier: search for ""Doctor Who"" instead of ""Dr Who"" and you'll find another great torrent for the whole season. You may also wish to look up the wikipedia article titled ""List of Doctor Who serials"" to make sure you get everything in the right order (If you're starting the series from where this torrent picks up, which I recommend for new viewers, you will be starting with the Ninth Doctor, Christopher Eccleston). Enjoy!"
