,blackmamba56,2010-11-29T22:13Z,"Great upload mate, been waiting for this for quite some time (and checking daily to see if it was uploaded here). Really great stuff."
,hattlely,2010-11-30T01:39Z,"everyone should check this out, then go smoke some if possible"
,Skypedelic,2010-11-30T12:26Z,"If you like it, please go to the official site http://thespiritmolecule.com/ and buy the DVD via PayPal. It's an indie production so you should support it."
[T],geogaddi000,2010-11-30T23:48Z,Thanks for the upload HIV.  But could you please edit your torrent details to include information about the DVD and where to get it?  Skypedelic's comment would be a perfect thing to add into the details.  
[T],metalcore.,2010-12-01T16:22Z,then please upload as a non-retarded file format like avi...seriously who the hell rips in a totally uncompatible format. 
,SalvinorinAlpha,2010-12-05T21:38Z,"I have to agree with metalcore. I'm having a ridiculous time trying to play this file. VLC plays it, but it's pretty much unwatchable. Same with quicktime. Someone please convert this to XVID and reupload it!! Thanks!"
,Skypedelic,2010-12-10T01:06Z,Plays fine for me too.. I guess there's some special retard version of VLC we don't know of :D
,Padmasana,2010-12-19T23:21Z,"Excellent upload. A-10, V-10. Was waiting for this. Thanks a bunch!"
,Felix360,2010-12-29T01:59Z,"Audio 10, Video 10.
Played without issue in Windows Media Player on Windows 7, if you have issues try changing the file extension to .mp4.

Lotta truth in this documentary but also a lot of sensationalist bullshitty type presentation kinda like Zeitgeist."
,Sugabombs,2010-12-30T00:35Z,"Great upload! Appreciated :) I've been longing to see this.

But does anyone have any subtitles for this? English subtitles. Would be great!"
,Skypedelic,2011-01-04T20:03Z,"If you aren't going to buy the DVD, consider supporting DMT research for free: http://www.goodsearch.com/?charityid=881791"
,raghmore,2011-01-07T13:34Z,"what is the function of our DMT( pitutary produced), the producers of this film seems to be thinking about this stuff as entertaining ie, media player kinda visualizations.   "
,Skypedelic,2011-01-07T15:48Z,"Media player visuals through human history have attempted to mimic psychedelic abstract visions. Computer geeks in general have always been psychonauts. 
The function of endogenous DMT is not known and it is not known to be produced in the pineal gland. It is found in our lungs on the other hand, so this might explain some of the effects of yogic pranayama breathing techniques."
,SaltSlasher,2011-02-13T06:15Z,"Wow I read the book way back in Jr. High, and I wanted to read it agian and I found out about the documentary. 
I am so excited, it was truely amazing what this man did!
Trust me if you like the video at all, you will love the book!"
,themartini,2011-02-26T13:04Z,"Great documentary.

Had minor issues with audio synchronicity about halfway through, but seriously, its not gonna ruin something this good.

But still, one of the most amazing documentaries.
WATCH THIS!"
,themartini,2011-02-26T13:05Z,"Also, the presenter will give you the shits if you have an IQ over 75."
,Skypedelic,2011-04-16T21:04Z,"Corrected English subs were released 21/02/2011 and there is a good amount of subs in different languages available, including Finnish and several other former communists:
