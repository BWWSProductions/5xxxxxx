[T],TalmudTimmy,2010-12-18T02:50Z,"Yes, it is out of synch. No matter how I ripped it, I couldnt rip it with an in-synch audio.

I recently learned that you can adjust your media player to re-align the audio. For me. I use BSPlayer. 

Options introduced with version 2.22.952 (indicating default key-combinations):
[Shift]+[Ctrl]+[arrow right] = increase audio delay
[Shift]+[Ctrl]+[arrow left] = decrease audio delay

If you're using AC3 filter, I think it has an option (under System-tag?) to time-shift or sync sound.

For  me, +600 msec aligns the audio correctly."
