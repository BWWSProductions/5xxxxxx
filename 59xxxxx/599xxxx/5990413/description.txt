Hii. Fellow Bruce Lee Fans.
On this Eve of the great Bruce Lee's 70th Birthday Anniversary, I wanted to take the opportunity of giving a small gift to to my friends.

This is the Bruce Lee's Screen Test which was shot @ 1964 just before "The Green Hornet".

Although some people may have seen it in few streaming website, Quality isnt so good And there is no torrent for Screen Test throughout Internet. Which isnt Fair and i cant take it .

So a Torrent as a Tribute to the Great Man and his eternal Fans throughout the Globe.

Enjoy!!! (LOVE U ALL)
Please Seed it well.

-A VHN Release.
