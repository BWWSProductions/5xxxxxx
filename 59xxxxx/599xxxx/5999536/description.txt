Dasbodh (Devanagari script), loosely meaning advise to the disciple, is a classical 17th Century Hindu Advaita Vedanta spiritual text. It was orally narrated by saint Samarth Ramdas, spiritual advisor of the famous King Shivaji, to his disciple Kalyan Swami. The narration is believed to have taken place in a cave called Shivatharghal in the Raigad district of Maharashtra in India. The Dasbodh provides readers with spiritual guidance on matters such as devotion and acquiring knowledge.
