Originally published in 1889, this novel is a humorous account by Jerome K. Jerome of a boating holiday on the Thames between Kingston and Oxford.

The book was initially intended to be a serious travel guide, with accounts of local history along the route, but the humorous elements took over. One of the most praised things about Three Men in a Boat is how undated it appears to modern readers the jokes seem fresh and witty even today.

The trip is a typical boating holiday of the time in a Thames camping skiff. This was just after commercial boat traffic on the Upper Thames had died out, replaced by the 1880s craze for boating as a leisure activity.

The novel was an overwhelming success and stands today as one of the great classics of early English comedy literature.
