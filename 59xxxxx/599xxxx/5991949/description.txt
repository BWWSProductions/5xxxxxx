The film circles around four medical students who, while out partying one night, spike the drink of a unknowing and innocent colleague; it turned out to be a very powerful sedative that accidentally puts him into a coma. The students, not wanting to be involved, abandon his body on a road and drive off as fast as they can, hoping someone will come across his body and help him. When they learn about his condition becoming fatal, one of the students (Arielle Kebbel) attempts to revive him using an experimental drug. The result has horrible and unintended consequences which leads to the collegue having out of body experiences that seem to posses the students who poisoned him and abandoned him, which he is using as means to exact vengence by possessing their bodies and throught them, framing them for murdering each other while they desperately find a way to stop him.
