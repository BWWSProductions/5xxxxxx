Futurama's sixth production season began airing in June 2010 and consists of 26 episodes. It marked the change of networks from Fox to Comedy Central.[1]
David X. Cohen stated that the first thirteen episodes will air during 2010 as one season and the remaining thirteen episodes will air during 2011 as "another run".[2] This will make the one hundred first episode, a holiday special[3] tentatively scheduled to air in late November, the season finale of the sixth broadcast season, even though it will air roughly eleven weeks after the 100th episode.
