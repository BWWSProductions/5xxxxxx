V:6 - Colors are pretty damn bad, and as with most cams when things get dark - the problems start
A:5 - hard to hear sometimes when there's talking and other sound effects in background, and songs hard to hear.. kinda blurs together.

can definitely get thru it if you really want to see, and thx for upload"
