From Wiki:


Zuckerbaby is an Alberta-based rock band who found success in the late 1990s. "Andromeda", "Heavy" and "Shampoo" were singles released from their debut, self-titled album.[1] Their second CD "Platinum Again" was released in 2000 and two singles were released from it ; "Overexposure" and "Holiday". The name "Zuckerbaby" comes from a German art film, made in 1985, directed and written by Percy Adlon.[3] The film is also known as Sugarbaby.
