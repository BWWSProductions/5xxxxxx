Get that stick out of your ass and let ppl thank who they want. Dont see you posting any torrents... noob."

,ohteppei,2010-12-02T06:41Z,I don't understand complaining about the time it takes either. 1) It took about 4 minutes to dl 2) It has a lot to do with YOUR connection and 3) It's free! I'd be happy if it took an hour as long as someone's still willing to put it up for our viewing pleasure!

,MEvsEVERYBODY,2010-12-05T12:39Z,I wish people would take as much time to figure out how seeding works versus the time it takes for them to piss and moan on how long their FREE download is taking so long to get...

,IcenDark,2011-02-07T02:16Z,This shit is one of my favourite series of the year!!!
,joo-loved-it,2011-02-21T19:18Z,"fiiinally; people who give accurate audio & visual ratings.
none of this c*nt struck uploader smitten 
A10 V10 bullshit.
when have you ever seen an upload worthy of saying 10 out of 10.
never.
keep it real with the ratings, they matter more than you know."
,Warbest,2011-03-06T22:49Z,"@joo-loved-iy

Normally, since your talking about any kind of upload, a good DVDRip, BRRip or BDRip is supposedly A-10 and V-10 since a rip should be a perfect copy of a DVD which is A&V10."
,jadicction,2012-04-17T13:49Z,Thank you thank youu thank you!
