"Another Bad Thanksgiving"

Donna's show-off and bossy sister, Janet (guest 
voice Nash), and her unruly children come to town 
to celebrate Thanksgiving with the Browns. 
Cleveland, still bruised by their past, wants 
nothing to do with her this Thanksgiving and 
attempts to drive her out. However, his plan 
backfires when Janet and Holt fall in love and run 
away to Las Vegas to elope, saddling Cleveland and 
Donna with the responsibility of Janet's kids. 
Donna, Cleveland and the kids immediately head to 
Vegas to confront Janet and save their family 
Thanksgiving. While in Vegas, Rallo and Cleveland 
Jr. stumble upon a winning slot machine and find a 
woman of age to cash it in for them in exchange 
for an "escort" to dinner

Enjoy :)
