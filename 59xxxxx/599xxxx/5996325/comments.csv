,Weazel24,2010-12-14T23:51Z,"There are no seeders.
I loved this game on Xbox360.
Unfortunately no seeders means this torrent is useless."
,wei0130,2011-02-01T06:14Z,"Yeah the singleplayer works great and everything, but the multiplayer doesn't work...."

,FailMaor,2011-06-13T23:27Z,"Okay, this is my problem. I extracted the Modern Warfare RAR and made a folder to my desktop, then when I click the GlobeConverter, nothing happens. All I get are a few instances of the ""loading"" mouse cursor, nothing pops up, nothing asks me for a prompt, nothing. If you can, help me ASAP! I'll check back every day to see if anyone comments and helps, if this game works i'll seed for 1 month."

,veliki_gamer,2011-06-18T21:36Z,hi guys...did this work online ????please answer !!!
,Mr_Fritz,2011-07-15T00:57Z,"Not a good repack, this one is.  The videos have been re-encoded to a lower resolution and quality, which is fair enough since they're just disposable loading screen garbage, but most annoyingly the in-game voices have been compressed very badly, so that everyone sounds like they're talking from a CB radio.  If that sort of shit bothers you like it does me, then look elsewhere."
,IchigoWEB,2011-07-19T14:03Z,baixando para testar XD
,IchigoWEB,2011-07-19T14:06Z,"@ Mr_Fritz if you want the game 100% as the full
then download the full and do not complain"
,1234kos,2011-08-03T09:58Z,Does it have multiplayer?? 
,sgmomu,2011-10-18T04:52Z,"@KIPPER -WHEN I RUN GLOBE CONVERTER NOTHING HAPPENS !

I downloaded and extracted to desktop using winrar."
,earth3,2011-10-29T14:04Z,"To all the guys who have globe converter dissapperaing:
#1:Start globe converter. It dissappears or doesn't show up.
#2:Leave your PC undisturbed for 1-2 hours. When I mean undisturbed i mean no gaming and no resource consuming activities.
#3:To see if the converting has been finished, start task manager and check if globe converter is still running. If it is not running, it means that converting is over. If it is running you gotta wait."
,earth3,2011-10-29T14:06Z,@kipper: uploading someonelse's work ain't good man. I know globe made this.
