The story begins in traditional video style, as several of the film's characters are recorded and asked a series of questions about why they dance. The film then cuts to Moose (Adam Sevani) and Camille (Alyson Stoner) who are both dancers and attend New York University. Moose is majoring in electrical engineering after promising his mother that he would not dance anymore. At that moment, he saw a pair of Limited Edition Gun Metal Nike Dunks worn by Luke (Rick Malambri). Moose followed the shoes and then accidentally stumbles upon a dance battle, where he beats Kid Darkness from House of Samurai. Luke takes him back to his place, an old warehouse converted into a club. Luke shows Moose the House of Pirates, his dance crew, where he later teams up with them to compete in the World Jam dance contest against their rivals, the House of Samurai dance crew.
