This is my solo, side-project called Super Nudist. This is the 3rd release that I have made, its a 5 track EP called \'Blah Blah Black Sheep\'. 

I\'m based on the Gold Coast in Australia. I mainly do it for fun because the whole \"music scene\" here is fucked. I make no money, play hardly any gigs and quit music every day.

Download on my dime and enjoy.
