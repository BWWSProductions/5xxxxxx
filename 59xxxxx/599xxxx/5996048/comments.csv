,muthineni,2010-11-29T17:39Z,"@dm2175
try kickass in other sites like demonoid..on tpb .. try goku61..i get all my movies from these two and 20-40

For tv shows stick to 20-40... rest all suck.. this guy is a freakin genius."
,lasantha008,2010-11-29T18:09Z,The answer is definitely NO buddy.I asked 20-40 for a movie & he replied he will do.You believe it took only few hours.Who can do so fast? He is damn fast & he always tries to fulfill everyone's wishes.We cannot compare him with any other uploader.His rips are always with the maximum possibilities at the lowest file size.He is the king of tpb & a good human being too.

Nope.Twentyforty is in a league of his own.Others try,but always fall short."
