[T],MitZep,2010-11-29T15:32Z,"hey i wud like to ask everyone a question??
do they prefer a 720p rip of about 600-700mb or a lower resolution hdrip of about 500mb or a dvdrip of 300-400mb???
pls vote"
,DSIN,2010-11-29T19:01Z,"@mitzep : It Depends on a particular Movie...
& it depends on length too...
for eg. a 3 hr movie in 700mb 720p Brrip will look like shit ...whereas 2 hr movie will look gr8...  finally it depends on uploader/encoder :D
so i'll take all these factors(movie, length/bitrate, encoder) in consideration & then dload a movie :D but 1 thing for sure... i'll never dload axxo rip again :)"
