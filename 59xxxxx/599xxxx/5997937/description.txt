"Everything Will Change"

President Martinez (Blair Underwood) 
confronts the traitor in his 
administration, only to be met with 
threats of exposing the cover-up of Avias 
Air 514. Even after testing the loyalty 
of Isabel (guest star Necar Zadegan) and 
Thomas (Clifton Collins, Jr.), Sophia 
(Laura Innes) still suspects their 
subterfuge, so she sends Simon (Ian 
Anthony Dale) on a fact-finding mission. 
Her suspicions are confirmed when Thomas 
unveils a shocking new plan. Meanwhile, 
on the hunt for Samantha, Sean (Jason 
Ritter) and Leila (Sarah Roemer) battle 
the mercenaries sent by Dempsey (guest 
star Hal Holbrook).

Enjoy :)
