Much better then the cam, yet still a bit dark. Very watchable quality. Worth the download."

Audio is a bit low, have to turn your volume up quite a bit, but it is all synced well and quality is great :)."
,declerque,2010-11-28T09:00Z,I only got the sample [which looked good btw] but i wanted the whole movie. How come i only had unidentified .r00 and .r9 files? :/

,rosyjo11,2010-11-28T12:13Z,"What do you mean by protection for downloading. I've often wondered about being tracked, is there a way to prevent that?"
,Reviewer,2010-11-28T12:59Z,"@rosyjo11 
Google peerblock or peerguardian 2"

,rosyjo11,2010-11-30T11:12Z,Thanks Reviewer - have PeerBlock in place now and you can tick off a good deed done for a stranger :) 
,KernalFart,2010-12-15T00:44Z,I wouldnt recomend it
,ripper2011,2011-03-28T01:30Z,"I don't quit know what to put about this one to be honest! You see I'm a massive potter fan.. read all the books got all the previous films.. so when i saw this on movie2k i streamed it straight away, and because i was so desperate to watch it i ignored the fact that it was an awful copy! so when i looked for it on here i spent some time looking threw all the available torrents and reading the reviews.
So when i finally settled on this copy and DL i was happy to find that it was a lot better copy.. how ever i was still a little disappointed that it was also dark in some places, but in the grand scheme of things.. being that it's still not out in the shops till April 11th in the UK.. and i didn't get to the cinema to see it..

And a big thanx to hiest for the torrent"
,ripper2011,2011-03-28T01:41Z,"@reviewer
I also would like to say thanx for your info about peerblocker which I'm also now using.
i was alos wondering if anyone (as i'm a complete newbie to this torrnt-ing0 i've read that if you limit your upload speed in miro to 80% of your tottal upload capacity this will help increase your  download speed! I ran an on line speed test which told me that i'm aparently runing at speeds of

UPLOAD-36kb.s

DOWNLOAD--134kb,s

So I've set my upload limit to (28kb,s) can some one tell me if this sounds correct?
Thanx "
