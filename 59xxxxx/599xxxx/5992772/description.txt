This is the WHOLE American Psycho (Uncut Killer Collectorâ€™s Edition) DVD plus the Original Motion Picture Soundtracks and the Featured Songs of the film!
I follow the (PAKG) guide to rip like aXXo with all my releases so be assured of the quality.

This is an incredible film and one of my very favorites! Itâ€™s also one of my favorite books as well, written by Bret Easton Ellis. Though the two media texts are completely different, the film directed by Mary Harron who co-wrote the screenplay with Guinevere Turner is brilliant! This movie made a huge star of Christian Bale who was amazing as Patrick Bateman! He played the character so neurotically and evil still maintaining huge insecurities. Plus to really be able to portray Patrick Bateman the actor had to be extremely physical which Bale pulled off brilliantly. I think he was in the best shape of his life for this film. 
The deleted scenes included in this release are wonderful and give real insight into the film that as a viewer you were not previously aware of and introduced by the actors themselves as they saw this twisted tale of the 80â€™s through their eyes. Also the TV Spots are classic!
The audio commentary is very impressive and uncovers a lot of backstory and behind the scenes material.
Itâ€™s a classic film and one of the best book to film adaptations of all time!
So sit back, and get ready to cringe! Enjoy this Release, and Please Seed! Thanks! Vladtepes3176

ENGLISH

DESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVER OF DVD COVER:
Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a Wall Street yuppie obsessed with success, status and style, with a stunning fiancÃ© (Reese Witherspoon).

MEMORABLE QUOTES:
Patrick Bateman: You're a fucking ugly bitch. I want to stab you to death, and then play around with your blood. 
Patrick Bateman: I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane? 
Patrick Bateman: There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman; some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me: only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable... I simply am not there. 
Patrick Bateman: I have all the characteristics of a human being: blood, flesh, skin, hair; but not a single, clear, identifiable emotion, except for greed and disgust. Something horrible is happening inside of me and I don't know why. My nightly bloodlust has overflown into my days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy. I think my mask of sanity is about to slip. 
Patrick Bateman: Do you know what Ed Gein said about women? 
David Van Patten: The maitre 'd at Canal Bar? 
Patrick Bateman: No, serial killer, Wisconsin, the '50s. 
Craig McDermott: So what did he say? 
Patrick Bateman: "When I see a pretty girl walking down the street, I think two things. One part wants me to take her out, talk to her, be real nice and sweet and treat her right." 
David Van Patten: And what did the other part think? 
Patrick Bateman: "What her head would look like on a stick... " 
[laughs] 
Patrick Bateman, Craig McDermott, David Van Patten: There are no girls with good personalities. 
David Van Patten: A good personality consists of a chick with a little hard body, who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things, and who essentially will keep her dumb fucking mouth shut. 
Craig McDermott: The only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or talented, though god knows what the fuck that means, are ugly chicks. 
David Van Patten: Absolutely. 
Craig McDermott: And this is because they have to make up for how fucking unattractive they are.
