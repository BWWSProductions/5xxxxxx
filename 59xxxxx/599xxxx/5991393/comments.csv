[V],twentyforty,2010-11-28T06:33Z,"Not decent - good as anything else right now - and 1 GB smaller. Be reasonable and when compare, do comparing with same titles in the same time of release."

Can you please do The Mission (1986) starring Robert De Niro.
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091530/

And if you are doing it, could you please keep it to 720p cos it has won an oscar for the cinematography.

Thanks in advance."

[V],twentyforty,2010-11-29T12:08Z,"Thanks.

@muk0690: I can - but that is 2.05h long movie, and even if I cut credits out, it hardly can be under 1.37 GB. And that ""detail"" push my encode in category of dozen Mission encodes, probably good or better as mine. It could be nice 480p - and you cannot find that under 1.37 GB as XviD - but half the size - 700 MB and much better choice...

BTW - I have encoded probably few hundredths of movies nominated for Oscar awards, in all categories in my common frame-format - but 720p cannot bring nothing what wasn't in movie already - except the size.
Anyone wants unquestionable quality should get 4.34 GB or bigger encode and knock himself out, not trying to search for holly grail, of a kind..."
,muk0690,2010-11-29T17:13Z,@twentyforty: Okay. Whatever you think best should be best. I'll go with your choice of 480p
,73045,2011-03-12T05:02Z,Works perfectly on my A-Stone AP-300 media player!! thanks!!!
