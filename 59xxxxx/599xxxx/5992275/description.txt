Used the LKRGv2 Video/Audio source. This was the best CAM I could find. Video was a bit dark and pix elated but overall not bad. Did some RGB-Luminance/Contrast(BlkBase&WhtBase)/Gamma/Chroma adjustments. was RED/BLUE heavy. Added major Video Noise Reduction and some Smart Sharpness. Did a tweak with the audio gap by -53milliseconds and normalized the volume. Ran it through DivX Video Codec 720p with balanced quality at a constant bit rate of 3000kb/s. Advanced Acoustic Engine MP3 encoder at 48000Hz Stereo with a bit rate of 256kb/s. Quantization was H.263 optimized w/maximum key frame interval increased to 550 and key frame threshold increased to 75%. Noise filter strength set to strongest. Psycho-visual enhancement set to masking. Total compile time of 17h23m19s.

Props/Credit to the original poster as always! LKRG without you guys this would not be possible. Please seed as much as you can.

Some might not find this encode worth the 1.37Gb file worth the download. I really don't care. I find this version to be a better viewing overall. That is why I offer it to everyone else. If you don't like it, BITE ME. Other than that comments/criticism and a/v ratings welcome.
