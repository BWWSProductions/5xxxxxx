[V],ChattChitto,2010-12-08T20:03Z,"It's not just a KeyGen, It's a patch too.
make sure you patched the file the KeyGen targeted too.
It's working for sure."
,i7rock,2010-12-14T06:44Z,"I pressed generate and then navigated to powerdvd10.sim, highlighted it then pressed save.  after closing power dvd it asks to buy full version and says trial version has 30 days left. how exactly do i patch the .sim file. any help would be appreciated."
,stbrides,2011-01-02T18:25Z,"I installed the player.
Then opened the keygen.
This generated a key and opened the folder in the programmes folder of Windows.
Then clicked ""save"" for the file.
It says it is registered and so on.
However it says the version is a 30 day trial.
Will see what happens in 30 days."
,johnpty,2011-01-17T06:19Z,"The reason the patch is not working for some ppl, is because the KeyGen app is not running with the administrator account..

This should do the trick:
-run the keygen app
-go to the windows task manager, right click keygen.exe and select Open File Location. This opens a temp folder where the keygen.exe file is located
-create a copy of keygen.exe to the desktop
-closed the keygen program that is currently running
-Right click the keygen.exe file on the desktop, and select Run as Administrator
-Use the keygen program as you normally would: click on generate and select the .sim file.
-Now the program will be able to create the necessary files and write to the registry.."
