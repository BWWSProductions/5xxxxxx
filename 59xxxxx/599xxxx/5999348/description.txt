Vern Buerg's LIST Enhanced v1.81 Registered DOS version. Requested from AMIBAY.

"I am looking for a registered copy of List Enhanced , a DOS utility by Buerg Software.
Mr. Buerg suddenly died on Jan 2010 so there is no way to actually get it anymore

Here is it's homepage, now gone but saved by web.archive.org: http://web.archive.org/web/200611110...g.com/list.htm

Long shot but if someone here has a copy and willing to sell it, please PM me. Thanks!"

NOTE: This is the COM file only! I also included Norton Editor 2.0 as this is preset as the default text editor. (NE.EXE)
