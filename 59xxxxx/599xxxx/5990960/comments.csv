,qwertykyle,2010-11-27T22:30Z,how do i download this? why is it .rar.
,qwertykyle,2010-11-27T22:45Z,this is so confusing why isnt this just in .avi or something. help.
,chuck606,2010-11-27T22:52Z,teesmaar u r a stupid fuck
,SkippyG,2010-11-27T23:05Z,"The quality is orgasmic, but we need more seeders!  Damn you leeching muggles..."
,qwertykyle,2010-11-27T23:10Z,can someone please explain to me how i download this? 
,EHetteSimrayz,2010-11-27T23:15Z,"Does the whole movie have the same quality as the sample? Most of the torrents uploaded of this movie, just shows the best part(the 36mins that were leaked by WB or something). 
BTW its going REALLY slow here, the sample took 40 mins to dl."
,qwertykyle,2010-11-27T23:18Z,aaaaah
,EHetteSimrayz,2010-11-27T23:19Z,"Ah, forget it. Looks like more people began too seed. Going much faster. Hope this is in good quality, cant wait to see it!"
,qwertykyle,2010-11-27T23:21Z,this is slow
,qwertykyle,2010-11-27T23:41Z,maybe they took out the trailers.

,qwertykyle,2010-11-27T23:51Z,anyone know what to do with these .rar files? i feel like ive been asking for like 3 hours.
,qwertykyle,2010-11-27T23:57Z,.bone has a version thats not in .rar files. just letting everyone know. its in .avi.
,EHetteSimrayz,2010-11-28T00:15Z,"@qwertykyle
just extract the files with WinRar, and it probably should become one file in .avi ;)"
,EHetteSimrayz,2010-11-28T00:27Z,"I have just one word to say: WOW! Great quality, not like those shitty cams that have been here for a week. Absolutely worth a download. Thank you, thank you, thank you for this AMAZING upload!"
,bonzai37,2010-11-28T00:30Z,Download WINRAR and unpack the rar file. Than play it.
