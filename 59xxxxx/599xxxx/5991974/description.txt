A little information about the movie:
The film is about the ship Titanic which are going from Southampton,
England to New York, USA.
It was the biggest ship of that time and because of that people thought
it was unsinkable.
On board the ship there are a young man called Jack Dawson and a young
woman called Rose DeWitt Bukater. He travelled in third class and she in
first. The same day the get to know eachother the ship hits an iceberg.
Titanic is now slowly sinking.
People panic and the crew close the gates to third class because there
aren\\\'t enough lifeboats. Jack and Rose stay together and decide to both
survive.
It is a very realistic movie and I recommend everyone that hasn\\\'t seen it to see it.
(There was no Jack or Rose on the real ship Titanic.)
