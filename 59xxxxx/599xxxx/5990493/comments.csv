,a_Meanie,2010-11-27T16:10Z,is this like extra scenes that r not in the extended cut?
[V],GoodFilms,2010-11-27T16:23Z,Read what is says above. The deleted scenes are on the other torrent. This one is featurettes and deconstructed scenes.
,tbone3181,2010-11-27T19:39Z,"people are getting more and more stupid on this site. its fair enough to comment and ask questions if there is no info on the torrent but for fucks sake READ THE FUCKING DESCRIPTION. its much quicker than writing a comment and waiting for a response, DUMBASSES!!!"
[V],GoodFilms,2010-11-27T19:54Z,A nice vent of healthy rage is what I like to see!

[V],GoodFilms,2010-11-30T13:01Z,"This is HD! If you want crappy DVD quality, STOP BROWSING THE HD SECTION."
