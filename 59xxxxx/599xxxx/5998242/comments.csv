,foxz,2010-12-02T03:23Z,Anybody got a link to English subtitles which synch with this movie?
,Bagrawr,2010-12-02T19:41Z,"Great upload

http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3979589/i-saw-the-devil-en 

these subs work for me."
,foxz,2010-12-05T07:36Z,"Thanks Bagrawr, the subs worked perfectly! :)"
,skorone,2010-12-06T00:42Z,Sorry but i can't seem to figure out how to put the subtitles i DL together with the film . Any help would be greatly appreciated.
,HillOfBrains,2010-12-06T16:36Z,"Thought I had most of the video codecs, apparently missing this one in FFDShow. Any suggestions on video codec for playback of this flick."
,kyyylekey,2010-12-11T19:41Z,"I edited the subtitles that Bagrawr linked to for spelling and grammar errors (e.g.: ""You are a rootless bastard,"" where ""rootless"" is supposed to be ""ruthless."") You can find the English-corrected copy here:

,dagseoul,2010-12-28T10:27Z,"not to be a dick--i love the torrent and thank you thank you--but to help us get the title right in korean:

it's pronounced, ""Akmareul boatda"".  the Korean ""ss"" is in a position that makes it pronounced like a hard ""d"".  Spell it with a ""t"" or it sounds ridiculous when saying it.  ^^

thanks again for all the work!"
,barton_fink,2010-12-30T19:58Z,"Thanks nice rip, thanks for the subs aswell"
,VelvetMirror,2011-01-19T19:12Z,Thanks!
,chrizx888,2011-01-24T09:55Z,thanks for up and subs! very good. 
,osriccc,2011-02-12T14:30Z,"I think the text file inside is the polish subtitles. No hardcoded subs, PERFECT resolution, beautiful in everyway, trust this torrent, download and seed this fantastic movie from this awesome director. Best torrent EVER. You won't regret downloading this. Please, please, please... Do ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" (2003) and ""The Good, The Bad, The Weird"" (2008) 720 HDRips too!! Same file size, korean spoken with no hardcoded subs! Please! They're from the same director and there are no good 720 rips out there with a reasonable good file size!!"
,somedude.1001,2011-03-03T13:32Z,"v 10 a 10
movie features extreme physical violence, murders and rapes. Be sure you can handle it before watching."
