I use Format Factory (free) to do my files
I don't own an Ipod,so I don't do mp4"

.mp4 is not an ipod format it may play on a ipod I don't know. But it will play with WM 10 or 11, VLC, nero show time, divx player I'm guessing almost any video player.

And it will recode back to DVD or VCD without losing any quality."
