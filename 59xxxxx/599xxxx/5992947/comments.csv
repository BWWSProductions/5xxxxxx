I created an account just to thank you personnally, because you bright up our week ends with this excellent show. I do appreciate the job that you do and I'm not the only one.

I was afraid yesterday night when I didn't see your new torrent coming...I was wondering how I was going to do to see my favorite show if you don't post it ?! 
But now it's here and we're all happy !  :-)

Many thanks for your contribution and effort to load it so quickly."

If you are late like this again, we will have to cut your pay in half!
