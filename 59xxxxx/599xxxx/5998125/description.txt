Goku lies battered and nearly beaten, the Dragon Balls have been destroyed, and a new breed of evil looms on the horizon! Frieza, a violent galactic overlord, has discovered the source of the original Dragon Balls, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll eagerly destroy anything to harness their wish-granting power. Meanwhile, Vegeta Ã¢â‚¬â€œ fully recovered from his humiliating defeat Ã¢â‚¬â€œ travels to planet Namek on a mission to intercept Frieza and seize the Dragon Balls for own devious desires. With Goku out of commission, courageous young Gohan must journey to the far reaches of space to defeat a foe far more fearsome than anything his father ever encountered. The future depends on it!
