,joe_lvc,2011-01-17T06:32Z,"Actually, there are still many unanswered objections about the moon landing and the author simply presents both sides of the issue in an impartial manner. As for the evolution part, he never questions the actual theory, just some minor technical considerations about the origins of human beings. I think that should be clarified because that comment almost stopped me from reading this since I thought the author was defending creationism or something like that. All in all, very interesting book!"

,felacio,2011-02-05T15:52Z,"joe_lvc: There ARE NO two sides to the moon landing. There are no ""unanswered objections"". Read the blog at:  http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/tv/foxapollo.html
Every BS assumption deconstructed piece by piece. Enjoy that!"
,osaka35,2011-03-19T15:08Z,"Mostly nothing but BS. 

asks questions, then follows up with ""well this is what I think"" answers. meaningless bullshit with zero accuracy."

,tobroketopurchase,2011-06-23T13:11Z,"there are many oddities about the moon landings that have not been explained, even cases of footage that was so obviously doctored nasa even had to admit some of it,

the fact that so many dont even want to listen to the questions being posed prove how closed minded people have become regarding anything that is not what the government tells you,

imo that shows they control you and your beliefs, when you resist those who would only question them and their stories.

,shr00mie,2011-09-07T02:45Z,"@tobroketopurchase you're right on target. There's actually tons of evidence that shows it was faked. Many many photos have shadows of objects at multiple angles which prove there was more than one light source (they claim the sun was the only light source), in all the photos of the moon lander the dust underneath it IS NOT EVEN DISTURBED from all the blast pressure (which would be impossible), AND there is documented video of the astronauts forging an image through the window of the craft (making earth seem much farther away than it really was from them).  If all that wasn't enough, there is a documentary called ""Astronauts Gone Wild"" where nearly all of the Apollo ""moon landers"" go absolutely berserk when confronted with these pieces of evidence. All of them are obvious liars, and its SOOOOO obvious when you see their reactions, especially if you've been open minded enough to actually look into the evidence for yourself.

My advice to everyone is to not be so quick to defend your corrupt government who has lied to the public about hundreds of MAJOR events and issues since the very beginning of this nation. 

Wake up and learn to think for yourself instead of letting others think for you.

peace!"
