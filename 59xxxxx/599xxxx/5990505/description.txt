So the overall sound on this is pretty much mixed. You have some "post rock"-y tunes in it, some classy ambient, some drones, some guitar tunes, analog-audio editing-ambient (making music with noise from the casette player) and even a 20 minute-monster-track. Note, that this'll probably not your style, it is very very experimental, based heavily on loops and some audio geek-ism (especially those tapemusic tracks). Except the tapemusic tracks, everything is done with a guitar and heavy audio editing. Maybe there are some tunes fitting to your personal taste. They all have the "wasteland" theme in it, for me atleast. I always had this in mind when recording them.
