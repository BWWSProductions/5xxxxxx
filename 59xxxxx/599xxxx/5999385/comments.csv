what should i do to make it work ?"
,greeves2011,2010-12-14T00:37Z,Sorry but i'm technologically impaired and I don't know what an Iso is or what it means to mount an image or whatever. If anyone could elaborate I would be much obliged.
,zbox98,2010-12-15T06:48Z,I need an iso or something... it asks for a disc.
,meero310,2010-12-24T17:45Z,"its a virtual CD drive ...u use ""mount image"" option to make a fool out of program "
,asianluffy,2010-12-26T04:13Z,"Everytime i try install always asks me to please insert disc, i have alcohol to mount images but there is NO ISO FILE IN THIS! so how in the world do you get this to work if it has no iso or image file and keeps asking for the disc, please help"
,asianluffy,2010-12-28T06:34Z,"nevermind my guess was right, download the 5.0 hybrid version to get the iso file and mount it, and install the 5.0.1 version, thanks for the upload, cant find any other 5.0.1 this is the best, thanks for the upload"
,insanecase,2011-01-14T05:05Z,"thanks for the Upload ........... just a quick question ..... I have successfully installed the app but I cannot open the .Bin files I presume thats got some data files in them perhaps they are missing the .cue files to go with them ? 

please reply if anyone has got them .bin files to work ...............

I am using Power ISO as my Virtual Drive ......

Please Comment"

,Nitrus015,2011-01-30T03:59Z,"This is just an update, I'm guessing you'd need the full version first, which is about 7GB... I could be wrong."
,supajoe13,2011-02-01T07:26Z,It is asking for a License Number what should i do now? 
,20khz,2011-02-10T16:20Z,"first time commenting on here as i only registered today, i originally dl reason 5.0 from anon (thanks a mill btw ;) and successfully got it to work on my mac with toast titanium (which i had to dl here also), as far as the 5.01 update goes if you have 5.0 installed it was quite simple really (i'm no genius especially on a mac!)

launch the installer (make sure reason is closed) and when its finished launch the program again and when it asks for the disc just run toast tit again and hey presto...

as i said i'm no expert when it comes to this kind of thing so if you're stuck remember g00gle is your friend
