Season 2, Episode 5: Cloverdale

While on a planetary expedition, Lt. Scott is infected by a plant and he now has a fungus-like growth on his left arm. TJ has tried everything known to her but she cannot get the fungus to stop spreading. Col. Young refuses them permission to return the Destiny to prevent the spread of the unknown disease and they face the prospect of having to surgically remove Young's arm. In his unconscious state, Scott imagines himself returning home to Cloverdale where he is to be married to Chloe. In his dream-like state, roles and identities have changed: Sgt. Greer is his best friend and is with him to act as his best man; Eli is Chloe's brother; Col. Young his father; TJ is a paramedic who treats him after he loses consciousness; and Dr. Rush is the Minister who will marry them.

After returning from Earth (via the communication stones), Col. Young is somewhat depressed as his wife asked him for a divorce. He's drinking heavily and begins to have a recurring dream where the Destiny is attacked by the aliens they had earlier encountered. They are demanding Chloe's return and in the first few dreams, his refusal to do so leads to the Destiny's destruction. In a later dream, he eventually relents and hands Chloe over to them, leading to a major confrontation with Lt. Scott. He is convinced that his dreams are a premonition but Dr. Rush has a different interpretation. As well, Rush still hasn't told anyone that he now has complete control of the ship. Meanwhile, Eli may have found his soul mate when one of the Lucian Alliance members shows an interest in his work.
