,V0dKa99,2010-12-01T13:10Z,"major props for uploading! been waiting for this since I'm too poor to buy it for PS3 (that and imo the prepaid cards are a waste of money by themselves anyways)

although one question, does this include the extra DLC that came out for the PS3/XBOX360 versions? or has that not been released yet? and if it hasn't does SKIDROW plan on releasing it when it becomes available? I hope so!"
,V0dKa99,2010-12-01T13:17Z,"should have googled first, according to the Steam website the DLC should be included as long as this is directly from Steam, hopefully it is, again thanks uploaders!"

,Caderlee,2010-12-04T01:37Z,"Never had any problem with a skidrow release before but I can't get this game to work this time around. When I first installed, the game crashed when I tried to start a new game and and after a second installation the game just won't start. :("
,tpbranda,2010-12-04T15:30Z,"After playing the first part, I was also unable to  start a new game when installing DTOV, so I tried this and it worked (btw I'm running Windows 7 32-bit).

- Uninstall Deathspank.

- Go to ""C:\Users\\AppData\Local"" and delete the SKIDROW folder.

- Go to ""C:\Users\\AppData\Local"" and delete the Hothead folder.

- Install Deathspank: Thongs of Virtue as per the instructions from SKIDROW and this time it should work (this will not solve the leaderboard error though)."
,Tirako,2010-12-04T17:42Z,"Hey guys, I'm having some problems with the graphics. I keep getting artifacts on main menu button's, the in-game hud, inventory, item icons, quest page etc. and the intro logo's (EA, Hothead Games). The game world runs perfectly, with only a few artifacts in the 'horizon'. My graphics card (ATI Radeon X1600) can handle Medal of Honor, L4D2, Splinter Cell Conviction, ... perfectly, and I seem to have the exact same problem when running the first Deathspank game. Anyone know of a fix? "
,Tirako,2010-12-06T13:00Z,"Nvm guys, I fixed it
Anyone having problems with their ATI-card, try downloading the ATY Catalyst Legacy driver
http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Legacy/Pages/radeonaiw_vista32.aspx
Vista version works fine for Windows 7"
,vodrok,2010-12-07T12:04Z,"@Tirako I got the same problem on my ATI x1600, but I got XP... anything to solve it on XP"
,Tirako,2010-12-07T15:46Z,"@vodrok : 
http://support.amd.com/US/GPUDOWNLOAD/WINDOWS/Pages/downloads.aspx

Just pick out your OS in the left column and download the Catalyst Software Suite. This installs a driver that is designed to work with all video cards of the Radeon X series. What it does is actually downgrading the driver to a version that is less optimized for your specific video card, but it seems to work perfectly for all my games. "

,bennyboytx,2010-12-23T07:07Z,"nvm :) thats part of the game. BUT i will confirm this works great with a controller (my ps3) once you get it setup. Had a problem with scrolling through the quest in keyboard mode, but no problem with controller"
