Probably because you're an idiot."
,Leguimo,2011-04-30T16:14Z,"I'm having some problems with audio. As soon as I press play the audio works fine. But, when a few seconds pass the audio becomes glitchy and eventually stops working completely. Any help?"
,alaea812,2011-06-22T16:50Z,"Amazing quality - Great file.

Plays fine with DivX but I get the audio problem when playing in Quicktime as well as not being able to turn of subtitles.  Obviously meant to be played in DivX.  Was going to burn it for my daughter but I don't think I can with this file type nor can I convert it if it doesn't work in Quicktime."
,d.v.m.,2011-09-25T07:08Z,@aoloffline what encoder did you use for this?
,beastinbruh.,2011-10-13T02:08Z,"waste of almost three gigs. no video is included, only unopenable sound files. don't download if on a PC."
