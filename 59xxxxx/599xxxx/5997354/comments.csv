,thecaptainofsweden,2010-11-30T07:54Z,"Not actually ""ripped""
embarrassingly, i used the info-text from an old torrent of mine and just changed the name without checking every row.. 

but it's bought on iTunes and then converted to mp3. :)"
,33rdegree,2010-11-30T12:30Z,"ok, thx for the info, i think we're all waiting on a lossless CDS version, that is if the CD single ever drops... =)"
,thecaptainofsweden,2010-12-01T00:13Z,"Yeah, so far only digitally..

it will probably be on some upcoming album, if not as single.. :)"
