,msmmpts,2010-11-29T02:00Z,Is the quality better than DVD rip?
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-29T02:52Z,no
,pickled_egg,2010-11-29T06:20Z,"it's the DVD rip converted to 720p (resolution is no guarantee of quality)

Still blocky & blurs when camera moves

download the 1.4gig version & you can't tell the difference

Best played on screen no bigger than 19inch"
,nittany,2010-11-29T09:48Z,"@pickled egg

It's not a DVD rip converted to anything.  Read the title, it's a TS (telesync).  A movie that is filmed with a camera, in this case a HD one.  A TS is always shitty quality compared to a DVD rip or anything else.  This release is probably watchable but I don't ruin movies by watching a TS unless I really want to see the movie bad.

Go to the links below to learn about the movie types before you download movies:

,pickled_egg,2010-11-29T22:26Z,"You're right nittany, this is not a DVD rip converted to 720p.
It's the poor quality TS that's claiming to be a DVD rip that has been converted to 720p

If you download the 1.4Gig version that says DVDRip it is actually slightly better quality than this converted version"
,soupcip,2010-11-29T23:49Z,"...I also completely fail to see what benefit can be obtained by converting the TS to 720p.
Waste of time and bandwidth as far as I am concerned.
And I doubt the TS was 720p to begin with 'cos it sure don't look like it."
[V],.BONE.,2010-11-30T01:01Z,has anyone evan bothered 2 read the NFO!! its from a HDcam the source was already in 720p witch is - Harry Potter und der Halbblutprinz TELESYNC German 720p x264-PFD - Size: 4.41 GB do ya research b4 posting stupid comments amateurs!
,teikyo30,2010-11-30T04:27Z,Bone's insulting people yet I don't see any links to screen shots here so I'm going to assume it is crap and not bother with this copy. 
,PleaseDontBanMe,2010-11-30T09:53Z,"after watching the sample it looks good. Quality is a little better than the other cams.

,AxxM,2010-11-30T15:20Z,"Don't do it BONE! Ive only upped about half a dozen music vids and that was months back. Am re-working some blu-ray rips with 5.1 audio and even THAT is time consuming.
In your league most people have NO concept of the amount of work you have to do with cam video and synching & muxing the audio. People just log on TPB and expect EVERYTHING for NOTHING then have the audacity to COMPLAIN if they don't get perfection.
SO.. for all the ungrateful downloaders I say ""quit bitching and start being grateful to UPloaders like BONE - Sat 27th = 10 uploads, Sun 28th = 4 UPloads, Mon 29th = 6 UPloads - all courtesy of BONE""
If we criticize the ""20 UPS in 3 DAYS"" people, they will just STOP!!
Anyone ever thought what it'd be like if UPloaders stopped? Yeah, there'd be nothing for US to d/load. We can't exist without people like BONE and we mustn't take them for granted. I've d/loaded loads of BONE's UPs and they were ALWAYS the best available at the time!
I feel so much better now! Thanx for all your work BONE.  "
[V],.BONE.,2010-11-30T15:55Z,in my Preferences it says - You have uploaded 2961 torrent(s). and ive been doing it past 2-3 years every other sites i upload 2 under bone111 ya get lots of thank yous ect on here over half of the comments are bitch n moaning...
,pickled_egg,2010-11-30T20:40Z,"It's not the best copy you can get. Download the 1.4Gig version. It is slightly sharper & blurs less whencamera moves.

This is just a converted version of the 1.4Gig file.
The claim that it was filmed in 720p is Bullshit.

You can argue all you like but it won't alter the facts"
[V],.BONE.,2010-11-30T20:59Z,the facts are in the nfo of sources ect have u ever heard of them super cool HIGH! DEFINITION! CAMS! that people use nowdays ??? or have u only got vhs 1s ware your from ???
,brandoni,2010-12-01T05:42Z,"Thanks BONE, appreciate the work."
,MrHmmBlah,2010-12-01T06:22Z,im with Axxm on this one. to many people complaining. if its such a big issue why not just go pay $10 and watch it. i don't see these complainers uploading anything. plus what do you expect? a HD crystal clear picture? be patient or go see it in the theater until then be grateful you get to watch it at all. its none of our faults your parents wont drop you off at the movies. 
,MrHmmBlah,2010-12-01T06:23Z,btw thanks bone
,PietjePaulusma,2010-12-01T21:34Z,I agree with Axxm and MrHmmblah... A little more appreciation for the uppers wouldn't go amiss. Thanks .BONE. Downloading now
,PietjePaulusma,2010-12-02T00:50Z,"I've skipped through it and as far as I can see this is awesome quality for a cam. 

Thanks loads .BONE. 

As for all the bitching; that's probably because it's so easy to make a TPB account and under cover of the anonimity behave like a complete end of the digestive-system.

I hope you won't get discouraged from uploading more awesome video's. (I just hope you can get such a good copy of part 2 for us, just as quickly after it's release next year... ;) )"
,Hasbinbad,2010-12-03T02:45Z,"Bone, go smoke a bowl brew.  You're a pimp, and pimps don't get mad at plebs.  Those guys suck cock for beer money, and you get your toes massaged by supermodels.  Carry on."
,VonMogadon,2010-12-05T16:59Z,"Everything I've gotten via BONE has been top quality. (I don't get camrips). Show the dude some respect & quit whinging, we'd all hate to drive ppl like BONE away."
,elykleb,2010-12-05T17:38Z,"thanks alot bone !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

this rip is good"

,ghayasudin,2010-12-12T07:01Z,Appreciate your work .bone. Thanks man. You are really the best.
,u239u239,2010-12-16T13:02Z,"i had to make an account just because some of the comments here . i have been dl here for some time now months not years i wish i knew about pb back in the day. well any way .bone has a ton of ul here. i have enjoyed lots myself even. i cant remember anything that i would call shitty. the name .bone says a lot i know bones other work and dont need a sample to know. i just dl it. i am dumbfounded at the way some of you talk let alone how you would talk to some one giving you something you would be happy to buy. we as a whole should use some sense when writing here and really discourage this kind of pre teen talk . butt pleasures your mother it really does date you when you talk that way and it does not put your comment in high regards with anyone here above 13 years old. you would get more from just saying you didnt like the quality or it was less then stated. just think how you would read that and ask if that ads anything to the quality of the site or the quality of this torrent. i know you could not think for a min that that kind of talk is helpful. it sure is nice to be able to talk about butt sex with someones mom. you just dont get that kind of stuff from any where on the net i have been. and i saw a guy sit on a glass pickle jar tell it got lost and broke inside his anus forcing him to pull the glass out before he could stand  (1guy1cup) 

bone you should know by now that you are far above a reply to these kind of comments your work sells it self like free pussy/crack or beer would. though i would not upload this ts here in HR. it seems that we people who have the 55"" led 1080p 240hz tv's get snobby a little but its only because these tvs show every little imperfection. its like trying to draw a circle or the taste of good booze . you just know the difference 

thank you .bone for the hundreds of ups you have worked so hard to bring us "
,iffens,2010-12-19T23:18Z,"bad quality,ewrithing is wery dark and cant see nothing,bad rip dont DL and 720p my ass!"

,oithatguyoi,2011-02-07T09:44Z,"damn its sad your t.v is only 240hz  cause mine is 600hz but other than that fact i have been around fro quite  some time now and Bone has always uploaded great quality when ever available.. !!! much love, and keep up the great work!! fuck i just spilled my beer, damn !!!!!! "
,doctordave41,2011-02-17T08:19Z,"This goes out to Bone, thanks for all your outstanding work. All these people bitching are freeloading leechers who probably ""snatch and run"" and don't even seed what they take. They have no idea what it takes to process and upload to any torrent site anything of quality. I do alot of video processing myself and I don't upload anything because of all the low-life little bitches that complain about everyting and appreciate nothing. They remind me of the nieghborhood brat that cusses and talks shit for the attention their daddy and mommy don't give them. I think it's about time that TPB started banning IP addresses for abusive comments and freeloading. Not everyone can upload but everyone can seed for 24 hours after they get what they want, and they can be respectful of those doing all the work so they can get FREE shit. Now, before TPB takes my advice and starts banning IP's. This is to all the punk ass ppl that wanna cuss and bitch at those that keep this site running. Take your transsexual mommas dick out of your smelly, streched out asshole and jam it in your filthy mouth and shut the fuck up. Stop acting like your tough shit and go play with your crayons. I'm sure all you bitches will have comebacks for my comments, and I will not reply further. I've learned you can't win a battle of words with a moron because they are too stupid to know when they've lost or been out classed."
