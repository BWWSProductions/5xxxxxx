Here is the official guide written by Nintendo for the classic SNES game Chrono Trigger, ported to Playstation and Nintendo DS.  This is the only published guide for the game and does a good job of covering items, enemies, strategies, tactics, and more.

The only version I could find out there is in some ridiculous .CBZ format (some comic book viewer format) so here is the same guide but in a much more accessible, friendly PDF format.

Cheers mateys!

**NOTE: This was written for the SNES game.  The newly released DS version is the same exact this guide does NOT cover any new additions like the new dungeon/weapons/items/etc.
