,trntz_man,2010-11-29T20:54Z,"First of all, thank you DibyaTPB for taking the time to upload both 720p and 1080p versions Enter the Void for the torrent community. 
Also, I apologize for the multi-post on all hd versions of ETV. 

I was wondering if there are anyone has received the French Blu-ray yet. It has been stated that the French Blu-ray will have both the theatrical cut and the ""alternative edition"" (Director's Cut w/ runtime: 174 min) of the movie which includes the famous missing 'Reel 7' which wasn't included in the original theatrical release. 

The French blu-ray comes out on December 1, while us Americans get it Jan 25."
,Multishares,2010-11-30T12:10Z,"The information says: ""Audio: French DTS 1509 kbps"". 

What does it mean exactly, refering to ""French"",
that it is dubbed in french or that it is simply a french release with the original audio?
"
,trntz_man,2010-11-30T19:17Z,"I didn't download this version but what I assume, since this is most likely the rip from the French blu-ray (which comes out tomorrow Dec 1), that this has a french dub as the primary audio and English as the second audio. You can switch this in the vlc player. 

If you want to remove the French dub and make the original English audio as primary, you can download ""mkvmerge GUI"". The program can remove subs, audio, or change priority of the subs and audio."

,[SeriousDesert],2011-02-06T19:50Z,"absolutely incredible film, is a must watch. Although i must warn it's the weirdest film i have ever seen.

Excellent quality, shame about the size of the file but i guess that's expected with a film over 2 and a half hours long in 1080p"
