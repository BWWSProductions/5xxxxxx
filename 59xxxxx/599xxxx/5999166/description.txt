Rock and Gem Magazine. December 2010.

English | PDF | 77 pages | 32.6 Mb

Since 1971, Rock & Gem has been the leading magazine for lapidary and 
mineral hobbyists. Not a trade journal or a scientific dissertation, 
it speaks to the average rockhound, providing the right blend of 
entertainment and information. Armchair hobbyists and diehard diggers 
will find something to enjoy in each issue.

Enjoy.
