,tfmoffat,2010-12-01T16:18Z,All works just way you said thanks for download good work
,altern8,2010-12-02T00:23Z,"This is an ISO file that doesn't open with MagicIsomaker. 

So i wasted a disc and direct burned it, then it's a shitty m2ts file, they always convert skippy.

It's a big waste of time and effort unless you're looking for a m2ts file."
,altern8,2010-12-02T00:24Z,"But I will say the quality of the m2ts file was perfect
A10/V10"
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-02T01:39Z,"@altern8 

Please stop misleading other community members because of your own ignorance, and unwillingness to read.

""This is an ISO file that doesn't open with MagicIsomaker."" - already stated in the torrent's release notes, AND the reason why.

""It's a big waste of time and effort unless you're looking for a m2ts file."" - All Blu-ray, HD-DVD, AVCHD, MKV video files are .m2ts. They are just in different containers or file/folder structures, so they are either all ""skippy"" as you put it, or none are."
,Ckouna,2010-12-02T22:17Z,"Thanks a lot for all the nice HD rips !

,JohnnyGhost,2010-12-17T04:22Z,Cinavia - this no worky on PS3 and Bluray Players. Somebody please Hack Cinavia ASAP. Sony needs to know that spending a fortune on a team to come up with this crap is Futile. sooner the better

,torres1111,2010-12-19T14:12Z,"Thanks for this! For me it's the right format so couldn't be better. Looking forward to see if the quality lives up to my expectations, but I think it does."

,lxuethc,2011-02-01T14:42Z,Use daemon tools to load iso
,tyrabit,2011-02-14T17:13Z,"just downloaded the latest version of daemon tools lite and nothing, this iso cannot be opened on my comp. so, in a nutshell, don't bother downloading this, there's proper releases of this movie all around tpb."
,nnizmoog,2011-02-28T02:17Z,"Audio mutes part way through on PS3 (v3.50).  Only time I've ever had any issue HD-R-US' torrents.

I have never been able to open these files with Daemen tool lite.

That said, I will still look for HD-R-US' work first!
.. quality is just that good."
,taniak9,2011-03-08T23:19Z,Audio mutes in this movie because it have Cinavia protection on the audio.
,Nunogod,2011-04-23T00:01Z,"Stop complaining about .m2ts files.
They have it's bugs, ofcourse. I can't add Subs in VLC to these videos but It sure is a hell of an HD MOVIE! GZ on uploading"
