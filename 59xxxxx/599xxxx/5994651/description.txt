This is the song that plays during NFL games on CBS.

Go Giants. 

I love this song. It's awesome! I looked all over the web until I finally got it and I decided other people should have an easy way to get it.

Apparently this song is named Posthumus Zone for some reason.  It was composed by E.S. Posthumus, an LA band. Enjoy!
