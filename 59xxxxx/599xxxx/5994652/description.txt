                    E4's BAFTA-winning superhero comedy drama  
                    Misfits returns for a second series, starring  
                    Robert Sheehan, Lauren Socha, Nathan     
                    Stewart-Jarrett, Antonia Thomas and Iwan Rheon  
                    as a posse of social outcasts who have acquired  
                    superpowers during a freak storm. In the third  
                    episode, the mysterious masked man saves Alisha  
                    from a mugging on the estate. It appears he is  
                    able to touch Alisha without being affected by  
                    her powers and she is intrigued. Alisha is  
                    determined to find out more about him, but soon  
                    discovers she's out of her depth. Meanwhile  
                    Nathan, Kelly and Simon go to a tattoo parlour,  
                    where Nathan manages to offend Vince, the  
                    tattooist and, soon after, Nathan begins to act  
                    strangely.
