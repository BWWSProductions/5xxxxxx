Description: 
Narrator Stephen Tompkinson's fake-peril meter hovers 
perilously in the red zone as we're yanked back to Rise 
Hall and Sarah Beeny's attempts to turn what is a chic 
wreck of a historic home into an up-market wedding 
venue. Sarah herself, and her husband Graham, are 
actually quite laid-back about the whole thing, which 
makes the panic-button commentary even more jarring. 
Tonight, the Beenys try to re-create Georgian paint
colours (described by one of the many Beeny children, 
with withering accuracy, as looking like "poo"), while they 
also try to get to grips with the wedding business. 
Unsurprisingly, it involves an awful lot of planning and 
regimentation, but Sarah and Graham are keen to get 
their first wedding in the diary. So a nice couple turn 
around to take a look. Will they be convinced that all will 
be ready in time for their big day?
