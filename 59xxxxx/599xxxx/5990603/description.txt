Winrar 4.00 Beta 2 svensk 32-bit + 64-bit
RePacked by nwz ingen patch behÃ¶vs

Version 4.00 beta 2

   1. "Reenter password for verification" field is not displayed in password
      dialog when extracting or opening an encrypted archive. It is present
      only when archiving and only if "Show password" option is off.

   2. If you enabled "Use for all archives" option when entering the default
      password (Ctrl+P) and specified the empty password, extract and test
      commands will skip all encrypted archives.

   3. If you prefer to use "Install" button instead of "Extract"
      in SFX module, but do not need any setup programs, you can add
      "Setup=<>" command to archive comment or enter "<>" as setup name
      in "Advanced SFX options" dialog.

      We changed it to "Setup=<>" instead of "Setup" as in the first beta,
      because presence of specific parameter allows to enable this mode also
      through "Advanced SFX options" dialog, by entering "<>" as setup name.

   4. Bugs fixed:

      a) extraction operation activated from Explorer context menu could fail
         if several archives were selected and processed at once;

      b) WinRAR window title did not contain the current disk name,
         when browsing the root disk folder;

      c) items related to extraction were not present in Explorer context menu
         for 7-Zip self-extracting archives;

      d) sorting by "Type" in WinRAR shell did not work inside of archives.
