Rx Notes
-----------------
Video Source: TELESYNC.German.720p.x264-PFD [Thanks!]
Audio Source: IMAGiNE [Thanks Guys!]

The PFD source was pretty nice. Needed the colors fixed and brightened up a bit. For this we adjusted the white and black balances also used a RGB EQ. Didn't want to brighten it up too much, and wash out the colors, seeing how it is a dark movie to begin with. we also adjusted the contrast slightly, sharpness and a few other things. After all the work to the video was done we just took IMAGiNEs LiNE and muxed to our video. Thanks! Enjoy!=]

credit Rx & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
