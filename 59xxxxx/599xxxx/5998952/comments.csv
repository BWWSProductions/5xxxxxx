A/10 
V/10 (Played this through my VLC Player and the image was perfect) 
Excellent movie and is well worth the 2.5gb download... 
Many Thanx to SaM and TheFalcon007 for an Excellent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a fast download...:)"

,Redundantos,2010-12-16T16:44Z,Now that's some shitty rip with artifacts all over the picture. Especially at the beginning of the movie.

I second Redundantos
sorry sam you don't deserve your skull
if you value your skull you should have at least check the movie before uploading it.

the artifacts are flickering dots here an there all over the movie... IMO annoying

I've tried several programs and it seems that only VLC Player is dealing with it just fine ;]

Although I don't know the reason.. Anyone?"
