Also, I apologize for the multi-post on all hd versions of ETV. 

I was wondering if there are anyone has received the French Blu-ray yet. It has been stated that the French Blu-ray will have both the theatrical cut and the ""alternative edition"" (Director's Cut w/ runtime: 174 min) of the movie which includes the famous missing 'Reel 7' which wasn't included in the original theatrical release. 

The French blu-ray comes out on December 1, while us Americans get it Jan 25."
[V],BOZX,2010-11-30T05:08Z,i will do it for the french one ... when i get hands on it....
,trntz_man,2010-11-30T19:11Z,"Thanks BOZX!
I am really interested in seeing the alternative movie, I heard it is completely different from the original theatrical release, and it has a much more depressing ending."
,hattlely,2010-12-06T18:27Z,I comment on quality not content but I have to Thank you very much this is the best movies I've seen in years. quality is perfect too 
,paparian,2010-12-10T02:40Z,"Thank you,
this looks quite interesting."
,rxav358,2010-12-12T05:19Z,hey! thnx for this one! was really looking up for it. does someone know where i can find subs for this? english? spanish?
,nehoc,2011-01-03T10:53Z,"Director's cut is 161 minutes, so this should be it. Shorter version, without reel 7, is 137-142 minutes.

Reel no. 7 contains ""some astro-visions, an orgy scene with Linda and the Japanese girl, the scene where you see [Oscar] waking up at the morgue and he thinks he's alive but he's not, and then the camera goes down the plughole where she's tipping his ashes"", says Noe, and 161mins version has those so the longest (director's) cut is 161 mins."
,copylegal,2011-01-17T06:15Z,"thanks so much!
so this must be the longest version...hate missing out scenes!
you should point out that this is the 

BEST VERSION AVAILABLE (longest/best quality) !"
,Tonfry,2011-01-26T06:58Z,Thanks for the upload! Please people... seed. I'm trying to download (and seeding like crazy as I go) but this one is going really slow right now.
,Phov,2011-01-27T14:53Z,"Thanks a lot for your great uploads man. As you seem to care about french movie, might I ask if you could upload french (and/or eng) subtitles?

This would be really appreciated. I know there are lots of subs I can find on internet but itâs way more convenient when they come with the movie.

Again thanks a lot for your great uploads. Really appreciated."
