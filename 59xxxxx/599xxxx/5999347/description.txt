Season record (0-0) 
Lifetime record (0-5)
 JESSE ANDREWS 
The Heat

Season record (0-0) 
Lifetime record (0-0)
 

Holly Heart is back for regular season action. Her Tag Team went undefeated and is ranked number one with a bye going into the playoffs. Do not be fooled by her win/lose record, this former gymnast and fitness model has learned much from the Tag Team league and is not the pushover she was in last year's regular season.

Welcome 18yr old Jesse Andrews to Ultimate Surrender. Jesse is big, strong and nubile. She grew up with brothers and considers herself "tough". She joins the long list of rookies who hit the mat thinking they could just win over an experienced veteran. Life is tough, but Ultimate Surrender is tougher..

Once again it is proven on the mat that experience is king. No matter how tough and strong you think you are, an experienced wrestler will kick your ass and then fuck it.
