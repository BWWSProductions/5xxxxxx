The Rolling Stones - Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow? [Ed Sullivan 1966].VOB


HQ very rare Ed Sullivan Show performance. "Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?" is a song by the English rock and roll band The Rolling Stones. It first appeared as a single in September 1966 and was included as the opening track on theversion of their 1966 compilation album Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass). 

Written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, the song was recorded in the late summer of 1966. It is famous for its horns arrangement (arranged by Mike Leander; this is the first Rolling Stones song to feature brass) and is one of the earliest songs to use feedback from the guitars. The Stones have said that they were unhappy with the final cut, bemoaning the loss of the original cut's strong rhythm section. 

It was released as a single in September 1966 simultaneously in the United Kingdom and the United States (a first for the band), and reached #5 and #9 on those country's charts, respectively.
