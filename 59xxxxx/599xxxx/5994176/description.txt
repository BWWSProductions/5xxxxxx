## about ##
MX vs. ATV Reflex marks the highly anticipated return of the best-selling off-road racing franchise and features 
the all-new Rhythm Racing 2.0 physics engine, Rider Reflex control system and real-time terrain deformation.

The Rider Reflex control system provides unparalleled precision and fluidity by separating machine steering from
body positioning, which allows the independently controlled rider to shift his weight, perform death-defying stunts 
and avoid potentially devastating wrecks. 

Unprecedented terrain deformation creates ever-changing courses as off-road vehicles carve lines and deep ruts 
that have a real-time impact on gameplay and remain persistent through the full length of each race.
