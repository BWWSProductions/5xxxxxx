,aDruid,2011-01-12T03:40Z,how much hunting did you have to do to find rip software that puts out that file extension??????  Not worth the trouble to download.

@ aDruid  -  You are a Buffoon.  The file format is the very modern and widely used MPEG-2 Transport Stream container.  You will find this format on most nearly all Bly-Ray disks along with many others.

You were expecting .AVI ?   Hahahahahah.....

Great short film, excellent quality, worth every bit.

Played with VLC, as usual, without any problems."
