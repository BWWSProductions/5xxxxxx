Just a plain DVD, with English audio and English subtitles, so almost any downloader can use it.

No mkv-shit so I did not get any problems with finding subtitles, or having to use subtitles that are no good, nor having trouble converting it at all. Thanxxx a lot for this proper upload.

It is a French DVD, with French menu, BUT EVERYONE can use this, it is practically only English-like words.
No French audio or subtitles.

Thanxx to the seeders as well.

Did I say thanxxxxx for the nice upload already??"
