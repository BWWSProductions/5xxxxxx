PLOT:



John William 'Will' Cooper (Henriksen) is a modern-day rancher, maintaining his ranch in hard times along with his friend and foreman Amos Russell (Gainey). When Will's estranged daughter Jake (Garth) returns to the ranch for her grandfather's funeral, father and daughter clash over how to run the ranch and over the death years before of Jake's mother, which she blames on Will. Crisis comes in the form of insurmountable debt, and it is only by working together that Will and Jake have any chance of saving their home and their family.
