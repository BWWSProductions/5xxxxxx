Ripped from the CD with EAC into WAV. Converted to AAC via iTunes. All the sort categories included (even BPM, lyrics and artwork). Don't know of the type of demand for this, so I'm just uploading Aenima for now. Will upload all their other albums, including Opiate and Salival, if you want. Enjoy!

BTW, first upload here, sorry for any hiccups.
