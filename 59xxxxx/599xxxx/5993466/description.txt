Tim Minchin's Ready For This? toured twice around the UK & 
Australia to ecstatic sold-out houses & critical acclaim. 
It has been performed in some of London's most legendary 
venues, including a packed 3-night run at the HMV Hammersmith 
Apollo, where this performance was recorded in October 2009. 
The piano-bashing, icon-trashing, nerd-brained, rock-voiced, 
hedgehoghaired, tight-trousered philosophercomedian is fast 
becoming known as one of his generation's most brilliant & 
unique live performers.

[NOTES]

PFa released "Tim.Minchin.ready.For.This.2009.DVDRip.XviD-PFa"
last year. However, their run time is 105mins, ours is 115. It
appears that, even though it's the same show, the bluray was
recorded at a different location (Hammersmith London)than the 
DVD that PFa released (Sydny Aus).
