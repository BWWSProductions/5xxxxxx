,doobtribe,2010-11-30T08:54Z,"Are these the full leaks 250k+ or just an initial portion?
Size is so small, even for a compressed file."
,StealWill,2010-12-01T06:42Z,"Note the official torrent in the description.
http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/static/cablegate-201011282316.7z.torrent
or through nyud.net

,ziki,2010-12-01T17:39Z,"@doobtribe: its just a initial portion... it contains 503 .html files in 70 folders.

,Darr247,2010-12-03T19:19Z,wikileaks.org is gone. wikileaks.ch is redirecting to an IP address which will probably keep changing to thwart the government-controlled 'bot attacks. I thought the idea of torrents was so a single site going down wouldn't stop the distribution???  why are there no peers with this file; only leechers?
