 http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/ now has an official torrent: http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/static/cablegate-201011282316.7z.torrent

Unfortunately there is only 1 tracker which is down.  I have not altered the torrent except for adding more trackers to it.  Now that we're starting to get official torrents (with a valid webseed) lets try to stick to them so we avoid all the fragmentation and duplicated effort.
