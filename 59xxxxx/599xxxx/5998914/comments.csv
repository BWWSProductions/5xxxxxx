[T],PirateBoy,2010-12-04T14:17Z,"@skelaturi

For the other versions, its ok. But for ruby, sapphire & emerald, in order to maintain slow time, make sure you have ""THROTTLE"" set to ""NO THROTTLE"". And don't press the speed up button(space bar).It is used to gain frame skip 9 at any frame skip level... :-D"
[T],PirateBoy,2010-12-04T14:21Z,"@RareNinja

Well done, congrats...by d way, u can can Groundon in Ruby, Kyogre in Sapphire & Rayquaza in Emerald. Catch Rayquaza, its 1 of d best and that's not all there r even more to catch (especially in the SAFARI ZONE)...
By d way, the space bar(speed button) is made to gain greatest frame skip rate at even 0 frame skip. Thats why, its the speed button..."

[T],PirateBoy,2011-01-09T16:21Z,"@amster88

I use Windows 7 & so, I don't know about playing GBA roms in Mac Os so much. But, don't get disheartened. Still, I will suggest you follow these steps which I have written in the following comments."
[T],PirateBoy,2011-01-09T16:24Z,"Steps to play GBA games in Mac Os:

1. Download a GBA emulator:

Go to this website.
http://www.bannister.org/software/ba.htm

Scroll down to the Download section and click on the download link for Boycott Advance in blue. You can either save the disk image (.dmg) to your Desktop or simply open it right after the download."
[T],PirateBoy,2011-01-09T16:30Z,"2. Set up a folder for the roms.

Open the .dmg file and drag the Boycott Advance application into your Applications folder. The best method is to create a folder called ""Boycott Advance"" within your Applications folder and drop the Boycott Advance application into the ""Boycott Advance"" folder.

If you would like to play Game Boy Advance games full screen, download the Emulator Enhancer as well (located a little further down the page on the website).

3. Unzip or unrar the game files:

You can open .zip files natively on Macs, but for .rar files you will need either The Unarchiver or UnRarX, both free programs.

4. Once you have unzipped or ""unrared"" the ROMs, drag and drop them into the ""Boycott Advance"" folder you created earlier. Here is what the setup should look like:

Applications Folder
Boycott Advance Folder
Boycott Advance Application
ROMs

5. Finally, launch the Boycott Advance application. If you have Emulator Enhancer installed, a box will pop up asking you to register. Simply click ""Maybe Later."" Before we can play anything, we'll have to configure the controls and video settings.

Click on Boycott Advance in the menu bar and navigate to Preferences. In this box, you can configure keyboard or joystick input as well as video settings.

6. That's it. Now enjoy the games...:D

Hope it works for u...please post replies if it works as I would like to know how the solution turned out!!!

Greetings...:)"
[T],PirateBoy,2011-01-09T16:33Z,"@amster88

Look buddy, I am not quite sure if Visual Boy Advance Emulator will work on Mac. Its good if it works, but I am sure Boycott Advance would surely work. By the way, don't forget to let me know how it turned out to be, ok? :)"

[T],PirateBoy,2011-01-13T13:15Z,"I think Visualboy Advance will run perfectly on Linux environment.

,GuitarMan1546,2011-01-26T03:01Z,How the heck in the world do you save on this?
[T],PirateBoy,2011-01-28T10:43Z,"@ GuitarMan1546

While playing the game, go to ""File"" then ""save state"". Then click on any of the save states (1, 2, 3, ...). It will be saved at that point. If you want to load, then (while playing the game), do the same thing and selct the already saved state in ""Load State"". It's very easy.

Again, some of the games have save option in them already. If you want you can try that too. But, I will suggest you do the Save State thing.

open visual boy advance; go to file and then select the rom u want to play; after the intro video of the selected game, the menu of the game comes; select new game (if available); or else, sometimes they want to know your name, do it and play the game...

Well, I think it says that ""The Internal battery has run dry, but the game can be played. However, the clock-based events will no longer occur."" - something like this. Well, there's a fix to it.

[T],PirateBoy,2011-02-04T15:26Z,"@All

Well, I forgot to mention one important thing about these GBA games. It is called ""LINK"". It is a feature where you can link two games (different games like ruby, sapphire, emerald, etc...) and transfer your pokemon from one to other. As a result, you will have the strongest team of pokemon in the game you like. This is pokemon trading, which allows certain pokemon to evolve, too! :) "
,Joshinater,2011-02-04T21:51Z,dude i selected Pokemon Gold i got to the screen where i can choose New game or Options and it wont let me chose any
[T],PirateBoy,2011-02-05T03:24Z,"@ Joshinater

Well, this has never happened to me!!! But, be sure you know the keys that work in VBA emulator. I think you don't know the correct keys. This might help:

Default keys (can be edited in the Options menu)

Arrow keys - direction
Z - Button A
X - Button B
A - Button L
S - Button R
Enter - Start
Backspace - Select
Speedup - Space
Capture - F12

You can change the configuration above to use a joystick. Go to
Options ->Joypad ->Configure. menu.

The 1 through 4 joy pads allow you to have different settings which can be
easily switched.

,l33tz0r,2011-02-09T01:46Z,"Hey, so this is a sweet torrent, but I have one (pretty big) problem.

So I started playing Emerald, beat it, but when the credits finished, my game was nowhere to be found (even though it clearly says your game is being saved after you beat Wallace/the elite four). And just to see if it was the messed up torrent or whatever, I loaded a joke save file (one of the ones from the multiple list you can save). So now, not only does my whole beaten game not exist, but my only save file is at the beginning, with 6 minutes of game play. Awesome, time well spent.

Please fix this. I'm gonna go through the game again, but I guess I'll refrain from beating the elite four this time."

[T],PirateBoy,2011-02-09T04:32Z,"@ l33tz0r

First of all thanx for telling that its a sweet torrent. :)

Well, after you beat the elite four, you are taken to the hall-of-fame and then your game is saved and you see the credits rolling. After that, you find yourself back in your hometown standing in your room. But, sometimes, (I also had this problem once) it may happen that your game isn't saved at that point. If there is a fix to it, I will surely comment again. If not, you can do what I did to evade that problem. When you are taken to the hall-of-fame, save your game immediately (before the emulator itself saves it). If it doesn't save itself, then load again at that point. It's just trial and error. It worked for me after about 30 trials!!! If you don't like it, there is another way also.

Here's what u need to do. First u go to Option on the Menu Bar on the GBA system on your PC. Then do this. Options>>Emulator>>>Save Types>>>Flash 128k. Then go the last fight with Wallace beat him. IN the last minutes when it says. Don't turn of your power. Saving...
You wait and then turn in off. Then turn it on again. There u go. Problem solved. Hope that helps.

In other ways, if u wanna continue with what u doing after beating the elite four. the step is... BEAT THE ELITE FOUR !! and then when the last elite champion guy takes you to the credit room.... the games end. WAIT TILL EVERYTHING IS OVER.. EVEN THOUGH Your SCREEN SAY THE END!!!! wait still!!! and then it should load to the beginning of the game saying new game or CONTINUE. click on continue and it should load your file to your room. save your file !!!!!! under your old file. next time when u open your file it should already beat the elite 4 ! You can now continue and catch legendary pokemon!!!

See if it works and inform me please... :)"

[T],PirateBoy,2011-02-22T04:44Z,"@ brinmisk13

First of all, this emulator is not the link version. You will find the link version here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6165101/VBA_emulator_link_ver._1.8.0_%5BWiFi%5D_%5Bimsourav%5D

How to use the link function:
====================

How to use the single computer version?

    * Start two (three, four) VBALink windows at once.
    * In Options > Emulator, uncheck Pause when inactive window
    * If you have changed thesis before Inside VBALink go to Options > Link > Settings. and select ""Single Computer""
    * Setup all the things, like controls, save paths & so on
    * If you want to use save files, you must rename them - the save file extension for VBA #1 is .sa1 (e.g. Pokemon Ruby.sa1), for #2 .sa2 etc. (the same is true for savestates - #1 has .sg1 etc.) - another solution is to import them, that works too. 

How to use the LAN version?

    * Unzip it to a folder like c:\games\vbalink
    * Setup all the things, like controls, save paths & so on
    * Each player opens VBALink and goes to Options > Link > Settings.
      (Open VBALink and push [Ctrl] + [M] on your keyboard to get there without going through the menus.
    * Check ""Network""
    * If you want better speed at the cost of slightly less stability, select 'Faster' on the slidebar (recommended for wireless Pokemon)
    * One of you must select Server and click Start
    * The others choose ""Client"", enter the IP address or name of the server and click Connect
    * When all players are connected, a message box with the text ""Connected"" will appear.
    * Load GBA game rom and play!

      (When someone closes the emulator, the others will become disconnected.) 

Enjoy:)"
[T],PirateBoy,2011-02-22T04:48Z,"Easy steps for linking:

#In VBA Link Options > Emulator, uncheck Pause when inactive window.
# (Don't forget to do this for all 4 emulators you have started. )
# In options setup all the things, like controls, save paths & so on.
# (Go to Options > Joypad > Configure Joypad > 1 and set up the keys you want to use.)
# Get a friend and repeat the same step on their PC.
# One of you must start vbaserver.exe and when asked enter type in how many players there are (in this case 2) so type 2, and it will give you a IP that has to be entered on the other PC.
#Go to Options > Link and press on LAN
# Turn VBA off and wait for 3 seconds.
# Go to Options > Link and use the IP you just got in the box, and press CONNECT
#Now do the same for all your friends who will play.
#NOTE: When starting vba server if WinXP FireWall is turned on you will see a warning. Unblock it!
# Load the same gba rom / game you are gone play in all emulators.
# Go to link or VS mode and choose Multi Pack (I'm using Advance Wars II in this case)

For single computer version see my comment above dude.
And for saving, go to File -> Save Game while playing the game, then choose where u wanna save the game (from 1-10, which are known as different save states), got it?
Of course u can save more than two games at the same time. Either play the games one after the other and save them while playing, or else, open two, three, four, etc... emulators at a time and play different games in each and save them simultaneously.

This problem of circuit creates a problem that the emulator can't save your game but you can play the game. So, i suggest if the above method does not work, then save by using the save states."

Well, I think u r talking about POWDER JAR and not POWER JAR. 

The POWDER JAR carries berry powder which can be made using the berry crush machine in the pokemon center it's located upstairs you must talk to the lady behind the far right counter with a wireless adapter connected she will save your game then you can choose Berry Crush have a friend join you then keep pressing the A button to crush the berries you put in the machine in order to create berry powder. Once you make some you can take them to the old man who gave you the powder to receive rare items from him ranging from Energypowder to PP Up.

Try the following, it may work...

1. Uncheck ""pause emulation when window not active""

2. Set both processes to Above normal priority in task manager

3. Try using VBA version 1.7.2 (google it)

4. DO NOT hit the turbo (speed) key at any time

Iam trying to trade a squirtle from Blue version to gold version and I got the time capsule working and got the two games linked by the IP like you explained but it says there is no connection on the Blue version. Is this normal with trying to trade from older games or am I doing something wrong? Thanks in advance again!

[T],PirateBoy,2011-06-09T05:35Z,"@ orion59

Currently, the following games can only trade with the ones listed after it:

- Pokemon Red and Blue can trade with Yellow, Gold, Silver and Crystal (although Johto Pokemon cannot be traded to Red, Blue or Yellow).

- Pokemon Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald may trade with FireRed and LeafGreen.

- Pokemon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed and LeafGreen can migrate to Diamond, Pearl and Platinum (however, the Pokemon migrated are lost and Diamond, Pearl and Platinum cannot trade any Pokemon back).

- It is expected that Pokemon Diamond, Pearl and Platinum can trade with Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver. (for Nintendo, not GBA)

But now it comes. I left the water and when I ran into a wild pkmn, it name was ???????? and had this avatar @. I ran away and my game froze.

So I restarted it , but the problem wasn't gone. I deleted the cheats but still no result.

yes. u can load from the game inside while the game starts. It will have an option like ""Load Game"". Or else u can also load from the menu [i always load from the menu]. File then the ""Load"" and ""Save"" options. That is easier.
Multiplying an item can be done by using cheats. Just google ""how to multiply items in pokemon gba"". You will get your answer. :)

after i load it and the credit ends, i went direct again to the main menu with no choice of continue and went straight to new game..

I am really sorry but I forgot because it was a long time back that i uploaded it. But you can give it a try. :)

Go to File > Save Game > Any slot you want

You can load the saved game in File > Load Game or just press the corresponding function key.
