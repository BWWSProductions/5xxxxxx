The film takes place eight years after the events of the original Boondock Saints, as sibling vigilantes Connor (Flanery) and Murphy (Reedus) are living a quiet life with their father, the former assassin known as "Il Duce." However, they are drawn back into action after someone attempts to frame the brothers for the murder of a priest in Boston. The duo travel back to the United States, where they meet some old friends and are pursued by Eunice Bloom (Julie Benz), FBI Agent and former protege of the first film's Agent Smecker.
