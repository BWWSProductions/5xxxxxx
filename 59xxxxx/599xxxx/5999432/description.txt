Outsourcing to India: The Offshore Advantage 
Publisher: Springer | ISBN: 354023943X | edition 2005 | PDF | 325 pages | 16,4 mb

The Senate recently voted 70 to 26 in favor of preventing federal contracts going offshore, yet US managers continue to beat a path to India because it is the global leader for offshore IT-enabled services. Many CEOs seek to reduce their costs or improve service quality, but not many understand India on their first visit and some are confused by the culture.
