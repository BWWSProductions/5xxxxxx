sceneline is just using the name to try and get more downloads"
,icebankmiceelf,2011-02-24T21:44Z,im not condoning the use of axxo's name as i have a friend who keeps in touch with axxo... axxo is not uploading anymore dvds anytime soon for legal reasons but at the same time i dont hate the person using the name axxo. if you have a good upload then people will seed and download... dont ride another persons wave to get ahead. make a wave of your own.
