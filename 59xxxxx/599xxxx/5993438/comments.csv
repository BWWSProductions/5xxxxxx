Thanx Hiest. But Warning to anyone thinking about watching this film, Don't! I am normally the 1st person to say not to put up your opinions on films here. just on quality, but I have just wasted 2 hours off my life on this. you have been warned"

,chrisowen,2012-03-29T16:21Z,"The lionk to subs above only takes you to a download for  MKV Player  so dont bother!

Does anyone know if this needs subs?"
,mozzers,2012-04-16T08:38Z,"if we are to suppose that ""Spoken language(s) as stated above in the info is indeed English, chrisowen, then one can imagine that it does not need subs. However, there are those of us who like to have subs even if the film is in English. Further, in reference to your comment regarding the link to the subs posted by gsus81 ""English subtitles here:
http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3809796/valhalla-rising-en"" they do link to a site that encourages downloading of their nefarious sideline program but if one was to look to the top of the page one would find the link to the subtitles i.e. ""Download of subtitles should start automatically. You can start download manually clicking here"" etc."
,mozzers,2012-04-16T08:40Z,"Oh, and thank you, hiest, for posting this 'un. : )"
,maximumdistance,2012-07-01T18:50Z,Jihadtime: I am often not the one to listen to opinions about the movie on piratebay but I was very much on the fence with this one. I will do the weird thing here and trust you so I'm not gonna watch this movie after all. Thank you.
