The video for 'The Country Boy In Me'. Filmed on location in the wild farming district of Sanda on Gotland with a huge cast and a minimal budget.
Rawley T appears for the very first (and last?) time in one of his own video-snippets.
Tractors, Wellington Boots, a friendly farmer and the delicate scent of pigs - What more do you want??
It's worth looking at just for the shirt...
