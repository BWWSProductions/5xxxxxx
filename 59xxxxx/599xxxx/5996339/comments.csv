,Mathlol,2010-12-01T21:24Z,"""1080p"" at 3.5Mbps doesn't prove anything.  720 it with a decent bitrate for the size."
,Mathlol,2010-12-01T21:38Z,"Oh, thanks for the uploads."
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-01T22:14Z,"@withus - You're welcome - thanks for your show of appreciation.

@Mathlol - Yes, and it's amazing how it's always the people that have zero uploads themselves that know the most about everything, but you're welcome. Enjoy :o)"

,Mathlol,2010-12-26T03:46Z,"Sorry, didn't mean to sound offensive.  Just something I've noticed.  
But I'm sure you know more about recent encoding than when I used to do it.  I retired from dvd rips long ago.

Again, thanks for the work.  I'm a follower =)
