Cetin Kaya Koc, "Cryptographic Engineering"
 2008 | ISBN: 0387718168 | 552 pages | PDF

Cryptographic Engineering is the first book that discusses the design techniques and methods. The material of this book is scattered in journal and conference articles, and authorsâ€™ lecture notes. This is a first attempt by top cryptographic engineers to bring this material in a book form and make it available to electrical engineering and computer science students and engineers working for the industry.

This book is intended for a graduate-level course in Cryptographic Engineering to be taught in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Computer Science departments. Students will have to have the knowledge of basic cryptographic algorithms before taking this course which will teach them how to design cryptographic hardware (FPGA, ASIC, custom) and embedded software to be used in secure systems.
