,polloksfinest,2010-11-28T19:17Z,"what do you mean all my torrents, this is my first one why would i have wasted my time uploaing a VIRUS i know how it feels..so dont ownload if you want, i was trying to be helpfull..!!"
,laned130,2010-11-28T21:51Z,"@pollok - I haven't dl'ed this, and probably won't since there are TS's out now, so I can't verify it.

Since there are no real checks carried out on new users, there are a lot of bots posting fake torrents. There are several tell-tail signs of a fake, and unfortunately your torrent exibits a couple of them - namely, 1 - this is your first torrent (bots get removed relatively quickly, so generally only have a few torrents) and 2 - the torrent descriptions are often generic, which I'm afraid yours is.

If it is a genuine torrent then please forgive locksewdd his hasty conclusion/genuine mistake, and subsequent trolling. And please keep up the good work; on the whole we are a very grateful community, even if we fail to show it at times ;-)"
,laned130,2010-11-28T21:54Z,"Also, your file's title says ""read nfo"" when there isn't one."
,laned130,2010-11-28T22:03Z,"@locksewdd - could you try to restrain your comments? If this is a fake, then taunting does nothing but waste your time. If you're wrong, and this is real torrent, then you've just given a really bad impression to someone who is just trying to improve our community... I notice you haven't uploaded anything..."
,polloksfinest,2010-11-28T22:53Z,"thnks lane 130 for your understanding sorry about the read nfo art, thats just because when i downloaded it it had an nfo file and i never included it, didnt think people needed it to be honest, thanks"
