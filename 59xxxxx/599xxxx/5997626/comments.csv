,atndigcrk,2010-11-30T08:20Z,wonder if this is a true 320 k or another nofs upscaled version from the h3x version
,tnas11,2010-11-30T09:40Z,most of NOFS releases are transcoded to 320kbps from gourprips!!!
[V],nos1977,2010-11-30T13:57Z,"People cryin' over FREE music... lol...

,malice420,2010-11-30T14:09Z,thanks
,atndigcrk,2010-11-30T14:12Z,"if its transcoded up or upscaled which most of nofs posts are notorious for ,im sure the upsize in size doesnt matter, its like taking the 81 mb version and streching it up , it wont make a difference, the eminem album has almost 20 diffeent upscaled versions esp from nofs, then people posted the flac and true 320k version

THIS ALBUM IS AMAZING
im gonna try to find a true 320k or flac release somewhere and will post on tpb if found"
,atndigcrk,2010-11-30T14:14Z,"not complaining at all LOVE the work uploaders do , its that when big albums ,people are always looking for the best quality to truely enjoy the music experience , nothing against the uploader, but i will look for the true 320k version and post on this site to share
thx "
,Anthrophobic,2010-11-30T14:14Z,"Good quality, thanks again nos for a great release."
,atndigcrk,2010-11-30T14:33Z,"if anyones wondering how to check true bitrate of a mp3 u download on the net, for future use :


EncSpot 2
From GuerillaSoft:
EncSpot is a freeware application that will guess which encoder your mp3 files were encoded with as well as displaying other information. It also reports on the files' quality and displays a bitrate histogram for VBR files. It uses a familiar Explorer user interface.

its on the cnet downloads section, quite handy , cuz winamp jus dispays the bitrate tag, which will show this release as 320k but when u find the true bitrate for comparing it, will show 192k, as is in the h3x release, not complaining at all, but like the others said noFS does this for all there releases, which i dont mind if u state it ahead of time, bc peoples download bandwith  can be expensive, but instead u say if u dont like it dont download it, how about not misleading people. upscaling does nothing for the quality.
not to be rude, but this is a fact, sorry if i come the wrong way"
,SoftWarez,2010-11-30T17:24Z,Why u even bother uploading H3X stuff? BAAAAAAHHHH!!! Transcode!
,Cody472,2010-11-30T23:23Z,"nos always on top of things ;). Thanks

,Jahorse,2010-12-03T04:53Z,"People aren't crying over free music, they just can't understand why you always transcode up to 320 kbps. Maybe if you gave an explanation people would stop complaining but this is the exact same quality as the H3X rip and almost twice the file size.
I do appreciate that you are bringing all the new rap albums to tpb and I have been following your uploads for a long time but since I have realized I can get the same quality in a smaller file size from others I try to avoid your uploads. I wish it wasn't like this because you have every release I am looking for but why the transcode? You totally avoid the subject whenever there is a comment asking about it."
[V],jainmehul,2010-12-03T12:07Z,"upscaling scene releases to 320kbps and uploading under our name is not good...!!!!!
also maybe people are jealous,because you don't deserve the seeds and the popularity you are gaining...
LOLZZzzzz....."
,aesan,2010-12-04T22:16Z,"Ya'll mother fuckers are such haters.

Show some respect for NoFS.

He has 24 PAGES of torrents.... double the amount you have jainmehul. So shut the fuck up.

I don't think I know a single person that hasn't downloaded one of NoFS' torrents, and they're all SICK.  

STFU about upscaling it who fckin cares, buy a real harddrive and throw away your 40 gig POS.


THANK YOU BRO UR A HERO DON'T LISTEN TO THE DUMB FUCKS"

,aesan,2010-12-07T19:51Z,"Nos,

I think Softwarez is a little upset about his bright pink skull.... He sounds (It's hard 2 tell because his english is so bad) pretty jealous of your green one... awww
