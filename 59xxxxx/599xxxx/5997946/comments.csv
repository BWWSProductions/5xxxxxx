,OSAMA700,2010-11-30T19:28Z,"What is the mean PPV ?? 
Is it like DVD?"
,altaiir,2010-11-30T23:33Z,"Afaik, it is Pay Per View."
,altaiir,2010-11-30T23:34Z,"And just to add, it would be rental through cable (TV) or internet (streamed)."
,ManuelRivero,2010-12-04T11:45Z,"Apparently PPV's are coming mainly from Hotel PPV systems, which get the movies before DVD release. International flights also have movies, usually in SD 4:3, way before DVD release, although usually they're free for the passengers (not PPV).
Quality varies, see samples."
,chefadam,2010-12-12T12:30Z,A/V quality?
