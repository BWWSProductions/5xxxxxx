Amazon Review:
Despite the vast number of albums that Petula recorded, she never recorded a Christmas album. This set is a compilation of various Christmas singles and EP's, some recorded in English and some in French, and contains all Christmas songs that Petula recorded for Pye/Warner except Baby it's cold outside. That song, which Petula recorded as a duet with Rod McKuen (and is available on Spirit of Today), isn't really a Christmas song, but has become accepted as a Christmas standard (just like My favorite things, which is included). 

The emphasis here is on the spiritul aspect of Christmas, including carols and other uplifting songs of hope and joy. 

Once in Royal David's city is one of those Christmas classics, like In the bleak midwinter and While shepherds watched their flocks, which is popular inbut is relatively unknown in America, but it's always been one of my favorite carols and it might become one of yours after you hear Petula's beautiful rendition.
