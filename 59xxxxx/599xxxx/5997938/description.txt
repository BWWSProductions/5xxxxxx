iPhone2,1_4.2.1_8C148a_Custom_Restore
=====================================

This is a custom IPSW created with the Pwnage Tool for the 3GS.  This will preserve your baseband and update you to 4.2.1.  

U will then need to use redsn0w to install Cydia.  (You will also need an official 4.2.1 IPSW file when using redsn0w, which can be downloaded from Apple).
