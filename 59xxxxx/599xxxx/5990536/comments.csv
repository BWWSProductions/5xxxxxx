,metallicafan7956,2010-12-14T16:56Z,"great torrent, over 1MBps top speed, but I have a problem.  I'm trying to convert these to mp3s so I can use them on my music player, but whenever I run them through Daniusoft Media Converter ultimate (which I found here and it ususally does FLAC to MP3 or FLAC to WMA just fine), all I get in the output files is a ton of static.  I'm not familiar with how FLACs work, but is there something missing/different about this set that's preventing them from being properly converted?  I'd like to be able to play these on other things than just VLC on my laptop..."
