,poada1975,2010-12-31T19:25Z,How about a non-FLAC version ?? Please ?!?
,Numskull808,2011-01-02T04:19Z,Love your blog!  Keep up the good work homie.
,Mrajsma,2011-04-01T11:08Z,seriously! why FLAC?
,Friedsushi,2011-06-15T10:27Z,"FLAC rules, is far better sound for those who are into details."
,cia09fr,2011-07-16T22:38Z,"FLAC is so much better quality, if you have decent speakers you can definitly tell the difference. Download XACT if your on a mac and want to get it into itunes. "
,Zeppoleon,2011-08-04T01:37Z,"Thanks for the .flac! 

For those that want .mp3 just convert them, unless you're a lazy sack of shit!"
,Gh057man,2011-09-13T16:29Z,"Flac rules. Switch sound file converter is great software to convert flac to mp3 for listening on portable players. The program is easy to use with a balanced set of features - so don't be lazy twats.
Why upload mp3 when it is lossless and can't be converted to a better quality you mp3 zombies."
,HerrNiIsson,2012-04-28T00:02Z,"MP3 sounds like shit, it make my ears bleed! Flac is good, thanks!"
