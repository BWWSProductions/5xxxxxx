,vish55,2010-11-30T23:59Z,"Hey Can you upload ""Amores Perros"" again...plz plz they one you did is not seeded enough....!!!"
,lilars26,2010-12-01T01:55Z,That is one big mother f'ckin movie bar.I love quark.Thanks 20-40.
,skillet92,2010-12-01T04:57Z,"Thanks for Transformers!

btw. Whats the difference between 352p and 352p quark!?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-01T06:35Z,"@vish55: Not true, Amores  was already uploaded TWICE - first time in one of the requests-pack then in [server-cleanup] pack. Both times have been hit ratio 52:1. I wont seed more than that. 

BTW, seeding 50 Gigabytes for one movie is more than enough. For movie I personally don't like, it's more than generous.

 Last tag (server.cleanup)  depicts the chances for re-up.

@skillet92: In encoding style."
,DSIN,2010-12-01T06:59Z,Ty for Bug :D
,froglog,2010-12-01T11:24Z,"Thanks 20-40 lots to choose from, it will give me some think to do as we have lots of snow here!"
,vish55,2010-12-01T11:38Z,ok..Can you send me the links of those 2 Packs???
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-01T11:56Z,"@vish55: Both are dead, I checked both BEFORE I answered..
No one is to blame: old torrents, several Gigabytes, end of the month - those who pulled down, stayed to seed as long as usual.

Never load week-two old torrents - here, my torrents... I seed 48h and if someone is slow, downloading more than one movie usually means - unfinished download.

If director was smart enough to cut dog fight out - movie would be wider excepted and I would be happy to do re-seeding as needed. 

Sorry. Go Google."
,skillet92,2010-12-01T13:46Z,"Hey can u do this movie in 352p or in whatever format which is suitable to u!?

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0913354/

Thanks alot! "
,lilars26,2010-12-01T14:15Z,"Hey 20-40
I think upping a bunch of movies at the end of the month is a great idea.This way,we can use up our bandwidth for the month and those who have already used up theirs' can wait a day."
,cindal,2010-12-01T15:34Z,thank you
,strmprpl,2010-12-01T16:41Z,"The Soul Keeper and Nothing Personal seem good.
Thank you!

And the HP 7 quark file is really good. Just took the sample for now.
:)

Great work. As always."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-01T17:15Z,"Thanks.

@lilars: Therefore I postponed torrent for a day - files were uploaded day earlier.

@strmprpl: I encoded HP7 as 720p first, but decided in  last minute to release a [quark] - realizing that is last week of November and small HP7 seemed as better choice for people on tight allowance than 800 MB HP7 720p.
Basically, [quark] gained not popularity except praising, maybe because people are too lazy to follow my strict advice how every [lepton] encode MUST be watched from proper distance - to give a chance to psychovisual built-ins to work properly - and therefore to put laptops 3 feet away and on TV/computer displays sit 6-8 feet back and enjoy in smallest and cheapest (DL-wise) encode ever."
,lilars26,2010-12-01T18:03Z,"Yes people,quark is meant to be watched as 20-40 says.If you have an HDMI output on your laptop connect it to your T.V. or if you have a play station(I don't have one)use that.Too many people come back and complain about the picture quality but if they only would listen to 20-40's advice there would be no complaints.Those of us who love the quark do not want to lose it again.Respect the quark and the quark will respect you.;0)"
