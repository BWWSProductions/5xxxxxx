This teaming of Linda Ronstadt and Cajun folk 

traditionalist Ann Savoy, billing themselves as the Zozo 

Sisters, shows how wide is the musical range of 

bittersweetness. The harmonies and shared lead vocals 

offer a complementary contrast between Ronstadt's purity 

of tone and Savoy's more piquant expressiveness. The 

arrangements turn folk songs into art songs, drawing as 

much upon chamber strings as Cajun fiddle and accordion. 

There's an exquisite beauty to the vocals, but the real 

surprise is how well the album holds together, given a 

range of material that extends from Cajun songs in French 

patois to stellar material from Julie Miller ("I Can't Get 

Over You," with husband Buddy Miller on guitar) and 

Richard Thompson ("King of Bohemia," "Burns' Supper") 

to a disarming revival of the Left Banke's 1960s hit "Walk 

Away Renee." Among other highlights, "Go Away from My 

Window" provides a showcase for the upper register of 

Ronstadt's soprano, and Savoy's lead vocals on Bill 

Monroe's "The One I Love Is Gone" bring out the blues in 

bluegrass. --Don McLeese
