I Honestly have No beef with you but I do have To agree with ToeD. Directplay have It's Own meaning It's really unrar and paly or unrar,run reg file and play via. .exe file. I Don't wanna just rain on you like this but you actually have been contributing alot to the torrent pirates out there.. just stick with the name.. 

DirectPlay > Unzip and Flay

Ur Directplay is like actually a Full-Rip < dunno how Full it is But

Full-Rip Unzip wether it's freearc 7zip and run setup.bat/globe_converter..

just take Note My friend"

,Guuru5,2010-12-01T11:37Z,"First let me say that I have no relations neither here nor there.
I'm just a common parasite which most people around here.
I have also commented on Globe`s use of the term ""directplay"" before.

The main source of this conflict, as I see it. Is that  Globe use the term directplay on his rips. This happened as i recall it when he moved his work from Mininova to TPB.
This is the tptb group's brand name. And when in addition globe's rips is far away from being directplay (extract and play), I understand very well that they become pissed off. This irritates me as well, as a user.
So in tptb perpective globe is a thief abusing their brand name. 

If Globe really wants Subzero to let him be in peace, I think much would have been done if he stopped calling his rips directplay.

,Guuru5,2010-12-01T15:35Z,"@globe
If I understand you correct ( not always easy^^)
U ask me why ur rips can`t be called directplay?

U seem to have a tendency to underestimate other peoples experiences and reviews. You simply dont listen do you?
Discussing with you is hopeless.

But one thing I can mention. In many of your rips the users have to move files to different folders after extraction. Before they can play."
[V],globeplus,2010-12-01T16:01Z,"To team4ualon3 : i donÂ´t really care about the word used to define the type of file , what i want is them get the picture about the way to use the file , normal to use my files you do an extraction followed by running the executable and sometimes a little conversion work after the extraction followed by running the executable and in both cases you have the game well worked and ready to go with the executable , only in one or another case the installation is justified and then the file get the Install indication and not directplay , the basic system is an extraction followed by running the executable with the correct competent work on the game , so what you think is the designation more appropriated ?"

[V],Subzero!,2010-12-02T00:17Z,"here is my suggestion.

when a release just needs to UNRAR for gaming.
then use directplay or extract2play (also kool)
(in case you recoded or removed vids,
use directplay rip or extract2playRip.

if a release needs the converter.exe after UNRAR then please put FullRip in.

and always supply the info what has been removed/recoded vids or sounds/music.
(the more info, the less annoying kids asking those things!).

thanks for taking care sir globe.

,MakMan06,2010-12-02T03:15Z,"Subzero should really take a chill pill. I remember back in the days of him ripping as TOED - he seemed like a genuine bloke and made good files.

@Globe
Right - here's the deal. This, along with most of your files such as COD, GTA etc are like Skullptura's work, and such is labelled 'Rip' or 'Full-Rip', depending on how much you have deleted from the original. Your rip of F1 2010, for example, however IS 'direct-play' as there is no conversion work to be done. Basically if it comes with a Globe Converter.exe, label it as 'Full-Rip' from now on to avoid the wrath of Subzero ;)

For one I prefer Globe's method, as the download size is much smaller and I don't mind waiting for installation - as I have a slow Aussie connection."

,Shoobox,2010-12-04T19:38Z,"@anku123456

Its because Globe isn't using the proper teminology of his rips claiming some are directplay, when in fact they are not. 
People download his file thinking its going to be a simple unzip and exe, when its not. which is misleading.

unzipping the game and then letting arc files extract is not directplay,

Directplay is unzip and exe the game.

,Shoobox,2010-12-04T19:42Z,"im not saying this game isn't directplay,
