Allmusic Review:
For their set of Christmas related material, the Manhattan Transfer welcome such guests as trumpeter Jack Sheldon (on \\\"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\\\"), Tony Bennett (\\\"The Christmas Song\\\"), trumpeter Harry \\\"Sweets\\\" Edison and tenor saxophonist Pete Christlieb. With arrangements provided for the backing orchestra by Johnny Mandel on a few numbers, highlights of this disc include \\\"Snowfall,\\\" a Santa medley and \\\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\\\" A pleasing set of jazz-influenced Christmas music.
