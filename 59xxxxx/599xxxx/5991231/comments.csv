Just wanted to note that this contains, from what I know, EVERY Steve Hoffman remaster.  That alone is worth your hard drive space.... they sound fantastic.

Happy Holidays and thanks again........ "
,Geinstein,2010-11-28T10:20Z,"This is just too good to be true. I've decided just to go for the remastered albums, to replace my own physical CDs (non-remastered ones).

Thank you!"
[T],JugzG0nn4G3tY4,2010-11-29T05:39Z,Are there seeders anyone know?

,niggyniggnigg,2010-11-30T01:33Z,"usually remasters amount to a gang of idiots blasting all the levels on a classic album and making it just about worthless...

are the doors remasters true remasters that a genuine doors fan would be interested in checking out?  

i would love to hear this is the case...and not the former."
[T],rjordan21,2010-11-30T18:42Z,"niggyniggnigg:

This is the case...

Read about Steve Hoffman.  He's not an idiot.  Download and listen. "
,niggyniggnigg,2010-12-01T04:30Z,"with that, i will check it out.  

thanks in advance."
[T],rjordan21,2010-12-01T14:12Z,"Excellent.....

Would love to hear what you thnk."
,SHRUDE,2010-12-09T03:23Z,"But.. this doesnt include ""Wierd Scenes From Inside The Goldmine""

Thanks I made my selection from the list. :)"
[T],JugzG0nn4G3tY4,2010-12-09T16:56Z,@ SHRUD: If you want Weird Scenes Inside the Goldmine try my other torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5405738/The_Ultimate_Doors_Discography_-_90_Albums_-_All_MP3 . It's only mp3 quality but its better than nothing!

,MisterKing,2011-01-13T12:17Z,"Although it's great that you are seeding this, it would have been nice if you had mentioned that you got this mostly from me / my torrent. My signature is all over it........"
,soneworks,2011-01-16T23:19Z,wonderful work! impressive! flac!
[T],JugzG0nn4G3tY4,2011-01-31T07:04Z,"MisterKing: To say that I took most of this from you would be a lie. To say that I compiled this would be a lie. This Torrent was on a Russian website. I downloaded it in its entirety and uploaded the original .torrent info to TPB. MisterKing, I however cannot thank you enough for everything Doors that you have provided to the public. I am very grateful."
,nooknook,2011-03-28T20:55Z,this IS impressive work here! thanks to everybody contributing to it! keep on!
,antoinethewiz,2011-12-26T23:37Z,"Do the compilations have any previously unreleased material? For me, it doesn't make sense to buy/download compilations unless they have previously unheard content. If there's something special about the order of track listing (as with some artists), then I make playlists. Great upload by the way!"
,Doubzstep,2012-02-28T20:37Z,"@antoinethewiz: If you want previously unreleased material, this torrent is for you: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5991248/The_Doors_Discography_FLAC_-_The_Bootlegs_-_89_Albums

BTW, I am JugzG0nn4G3tY4."
