,immugio,2011-06-10T20:39Z,"ok, i might be retarded but i can't figure out how to install it. i probly don't have a program i need or something. i have winrar and extracted to the same file, then i get a .bin that's 500mg and some other stuff. but no .exe .. if ne one has an ez fix just post it il check back"
,immugio,2011-06-10T20:41Z,"i figured it out.. the .bin file is actually an image of a cd, and needs to be burned to a disc or a virtual cd rom drive to work. now to remember what the name of that program i used to have is.............................."
