Firebreather
It's not easy being a teen like Duncan. His mom wants him to pay more 

attention to his homework, while his dad -- a 120-foot-tall monster known as a 

Kaiju -- wants him to become the next King of All Monsters. When these 

worlds collide, Duncan must use his human wits and his Kaiju powers -- 

including super strength, agility and the ability to breathe fire -- to protect his 

family and friends from a giant monster rampage. Watch the new Firebreather 

animated movie coming this November to Cartoon Network.
