,mikeyjoe80,2011-06-08T02:17Z,"Works great, thank you for the awesome upload :) One thing though, this pretty much requires a joystick or controller to work. You can use your keyboard and mouse, but its very limited and almost sucks. Use a controller/joystick, you will be glad you did."
,lordshadows,2011-08-06T22:32Z,"Yea mikeyjoe I agree. I personally reccomend an use the X-Arcade.  They have the single player version and the 2 player version with a trackball.

I own the single player version.  A bit pricey most will admit but to me worth every penny. It comes with a lifetime guarrante an it is the only gaming stick you will ever need."
,trollslayer666,2011-08-08T03:49Z,it aint workin its some sorta image disk file i dont fuckin know. what should i do
,michaelmpp,2011-10-10T20:29Z,"all i got was some stupid NTI or something image program also, am doing something wrong?"
,AlmightyDread,2011-10-13T17:23Z,"trollslayer666 and michaelmpp, stop being dickheads. When you see an unfamiliar file extension, do some research to find out how to use the file. In this case, a drive emulator such as PowerISO is requred. Use a virtual drive to mount this .iso image, and install the game emulator. Simple.

Uploader, thanks for the nostalgia trip I got off this."

I BURNED IMAGE TO DISC USING NERO .
JUST CLICK THE INSTALL .EXE IF THE DISC DOESNT AUTO INSTALL .
I GOT A CHEAP 10 QUID CONTROLLER , DEFO WORTH IT TO PLAY SOME OF THESE GAMES , USING KEYBOARD JUST SUCKS .
MY FAVE GAME OF ALL TIME IS ALSO ON THIS , THE LEGENDARY ( DEFENDER ) AND PLAYS JUST LIKE THE ARCADE VERSION WE LOVED . WISH I COULD BUY A CONTROLLER THAT WOULD PLAY THIS GAME BETTER . ANYONE KNOW THE BEST CONTROLLER JUST FOR THIS GAME ALONE . 
BIG THANKS TO UPLOADER , PLEASE KEEP THIS TORRENT ALIVE . "
