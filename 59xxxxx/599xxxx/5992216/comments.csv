,kiwilove007,2011-01-26T10:53Z,"I highly recommend watching 'The John Searl Story' movie.  He is very much like a Nikola Tesla of our times - and his work is very much related to that of Ed Leedskalnin - that of his flywheel, and the mathematics behind that, like Ed - Searl's work has to do with magnets and magnetism - that our world today has not fully tapped into what is achievable with magnets and magnetic fields - could solve our problems now.  I heard of Searl way back in the late? 70s' but didn't know of the details, which are revealed in this enlightening documentary."
