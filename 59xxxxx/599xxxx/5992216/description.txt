Born in England on May 2, 1932, John Searl experienced recurring childhood dreams that led him to design a revolutionary electrical generator fueled only by rotating magnets, and large discs that emulated the flight characteristics displayed by many UFOs. It is said that the first Sunday of every month between 1968 and 1972, Searl demonstrated his generators and flying discs to the general public. Television cameramen and news reporters were supposedly present for the events, and Searl claims he also demonstrated his flying disc to US military personnel.

Not surprisingly, opposition to a fuel-less device was fierce. Multi-billion dollar industries, governments and mainstream scientists were quick to label John Searl a crackpot ...
 

He was subjected to ridicule and torment,
fell victim to arson and theft, was imprisoned
and left destitute. His research and devices
were destroyed. But, John Searl is still alive
today, and continues his mission to prove himself
by rebuilding his amazing generator.

So, is Searl telling the truth? Could John Searl's revolutionary generator solve the energy crisis?
