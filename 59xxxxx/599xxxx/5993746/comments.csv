Is that correct that nightwatch is french dubbed? Is there a reason for that? Is there an original audio track muxed in there too or no? Just wondering before i download cheers.

Anyway either way thanks for nightwatch and daywatch aswell"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-28T20:18Z,"@justregged: Thanks. Regarding Day&Night, I am well aware of past existence of 7 different versions of Day Watch and 6 versions of Night Watch. But, its ...well... behind. I got versions which are still available - and Night Watch Unrated was always available as English dubbed version only.

Both dubs are executed professionally, it isn't Hong Kong movie from eighties, nor Sergio Leone western movies. 

However, anyone who ain't satisfied - as always - can pay a visit to amazon dot com or ebay or - buy a ticket to Kiev, Ukraine and get original DVDs for few bucks only."

I need high quality sources, I got both like hour ago and they would be in TV.Pack - tomorrow. You see... I never know when can I get sources therefore I haven't answered back then.

@aftaab4u: I always - very visibly - tag encodes with non-English audio. So - it's English, right?"

,lilars26,2010-11-29T00:59Z,"I know I ask a lot of stupid questions but what does REQUESTS ARE ""FROZEN"" mean?"
[V],HolyRoses,2010-11-29T02:48Z,i filled that spin.  he shouldn't spam torrents with requests either.  he requested it from a ton of people.
,muthineni,2010-11-29T03:27Z,"@ liars26

,DSIN,2010-11-29T10:39Z,"Thanx dude...
i'm taking daywatch & intimacy as iam sure they're better than any 272p out there...& in half the size...
:D"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-29T11:01Z,"Thanks.

@bender1110: If they're good, probably yes, even if I cannot comprehend choices of Academy members. I am still puzzled by winning of Slumdog M. and I never again could take Oscar nominations and prizes seriously."
,froglog,2010-11-29T11:49Z,Thanks 20-40 for the great chose as always
,r-0987,2010-11-29T12:00Z,"Hey ! thanx For The Movies ! Just 1 Question!!!
Will The Quality Be Good On A Lcd Computer Screen Of 18 Inches?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-29T14:03Z,"@r-0987: I bought LG Led LCD 23.5"" few months ago and when I played my 272p for the first time - it was like someone has hit me  in the stomach. On my old monitor, CRT one, same encode looked  absolutely flawless. 
Then I done few things:
- Installed CoreAVC and DivX 1.0 Pro (I uploaded them in my ""Recommended.Playback.for.Win"" torrent)
- plugged HDMI cable instead of usual one (what, by my surprise, got further 15% (subjective) improvement alone, especially in terms of reducing the 'blockiness'
-in Controls of GraphicDrivers rise anti-aliasing and all advanced post-processing features to maximum
- ALWAYS watched from the proper watching distance (6-8 feet)

Now - everything looks fine.

Am I satisfied? NO. Cheapest plain CRT monitors (I had from 17-22"" ones) are at least twice as good in terms of dynamic picture (not static, as plain text). I have both monitors connected, but not anyone has this ability.
