O&O Defrag 14.1 Build 305 Professional Edition
32 and 64 Bit version
Incl. Serials

O&O Defrag puts is a replacement for the standard Windows defragmenter, that offers a much advanced set of features. It puts fragmented files together and maximizes your system speed and offers five different defragmentation strategies, as well as OneButtonDefrag technology for automatic adjustment of the settings best fitting for your system. The program can defragment drives manually, or fully automatic in the background, keeping your system at peak performance by avoiding build-up of file fragmentation. Defragmentation jobs can also be scheduled, using various criteria. Additional features include status reports, cluster inspector, command line interface, optional MMC integration, boot time defragmentation, special support for mobile systems and more. O&O Defrag solves the performance and stability problems of Windows workstations and servers caused by fragmented hard disks. Fragmentation is the main cause of significant losses in performance in Windows. 


Due to the fact that the hard disk is the slowest component of a computer, its optimization is an especially important issue. By using O&O Defrag, files can be read and written much more quickly. What at first seems to be lost performance can easily be rediscovered and realized again with O&O Defrag, giving you the peace of mind that your hardware is in good health and operating optimally.

The new O&O Defrag Professional Edition  unleashes the  hid-den  performance  of  your  computer.  O&O  Defrag  optimizes  your hard  disk  and  effciently  packs fle fragments  together  again. O&O Defrag  is  everything  superior  defragmentation  software should be: it gives you fully automatic defragmentation for the home user as well as expert-level professional setting options.
