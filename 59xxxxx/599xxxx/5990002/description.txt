doumentry info:

40 years after Jimi Hendrix's death on September 18th 1970, 
this film tells Jimi Hendrix's life story in his own words and 
is narrated by funk legend Bootsy Collins in the soft, authoritative voice of Hendrix himself.
Blending archive footage, artefacts, news archive and rare performance footage, 
director Bob Smeaton's film takes us from Hendrix's childhood in Seattle, 
through his spell in the army and on to his time on the chitlin circuit backing 
the likes of the Isley Brothers and Little Richard, his 'discovery' 
by ex-Animal Chas Chandler in New York, the formation of the Experience in 
the UK and his launch and instant popstardom in London in 1966, his stellar 
festival appearances at Monterey and Woodstock, his artistic progression, 
his lastconcert at the end of August 1970 at the Isle of Wight Festival 
and his tragic death in Notting Hill, choked on his own vomit and red wine.


great stuff is all i can say...
