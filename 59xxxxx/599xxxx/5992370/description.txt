SYNOPSIS

Expanding upon her award-winning investigative series God's Warriors, CNN chief 
international correspondent Christiane Amanpour reports in a new documentary that 
examines the nexus of politics and faith. For Buddha's Warriors, Amanpour explores 
a new generation of Buddhists who are actively engaged in political struggle. 
These believers of love, kindness and nonviolence struggle to remain true to their 
beliefs while at the same time confronting severe political and cultural oppression.

In Buddha's Warriors, Amanpour investigates the roots of the conflict between 
Chinese authority and ethnic Tibetans. Nearly 50 years ago, the Dalai Lama fled 
Tibet after a failed uprising against communist rule. Tibetans say that all but 
13 of 6,000 Buddhist monasteries were destroyed under Chairman Mao's Cultural 
Revolution from 1966 to 1976. Those that have been rebuilt are now under the 
close, watchful eye of the Chinese government. Monks there say that they are 
forced to denounce the Dalai Lama and swear allegiance to China.
