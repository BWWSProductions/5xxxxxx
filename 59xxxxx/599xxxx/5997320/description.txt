Heavy Dubstep 2010 Part 10 (The Xmas Final Edition)


Well 2010 has been a great year for the movement of dubstep, many new producers have come on the scene and fabricated very solid dubstep while incorparating preety much every style & genre in the process. 


Dubstep as we know it is always changing and there is alot to be listened to! this is why i mainly started these torrents to share the glorious sound of bass. 


This is the final edition of ''Heavy Dubstep 2010'' to celebrate the the 10th volume of heavy dubz 2010 and with xmas just around the corner i have included some mixes of all the tunes i have ul'ed from DJ's all around the world and made it 3gb 


A Massive thankyou goes out again to the seeders who have preety much made these torrents by seeding and sharing the tunes and all the dj's who got involved in sending dj sets to me, i hope you all have an immense xmas and enjoy this vol 



PEACE 2 ALL
