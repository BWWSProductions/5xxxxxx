Howw turn my w7 to xp2 compatibility ?"
[T],PirateBoy,2010-12-05T04:50Z,"Right click on ""Naruto The Way of The Ninja"" game file and go to Properties. Then under Compatibility tab, choose the desired Compatibility Mode. Win 2000 (in my case is ok), but I already have XP3 installed in my PC... :-D"

You can either do whatever I already told above or else if your WIN 7 is Home Premium version or above, then you can turn on the ""XP mode"" in-built feature of WIN 7...happy gaming...:D"
