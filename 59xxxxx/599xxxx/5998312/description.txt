Welcome to LastXP v20

Time to see what fun XP can be when it's made for you the users, instead of being limited by Legalities, a fully featured OS with no holding back, if somthing was good - it was included, if somthing was bad, it was removed. all thats left is the OS with the most tools and the most options, made to save you time and effort with more new features than ALL previous LastXP's combined.

LastXP v20 is aimed at home users who wish to mod an OS simply and to suit them, It has been specially programmed to allow theming and modding as well as choosing what apps to include/remove. So v20 is classed as a Base OS for modders but at the same time offers a Default install that allows options to be changed at the very start of the install.
