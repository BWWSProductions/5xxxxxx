the screen shot links dosen't work "
,asdfg8732,2010-11-28T21:59Z,"oh sorry

,BDJDOG,2010-11-29T03:38Z,this crap is worse than DVD...take this crap to the regular movie section! Just because its 720 doesn't mean its HD!
,vidwa,2010-11-29T04:37Z,"a:? v:?
and this movie barely came out how can u assume that it'll be 720p dvd quality if there isnt a dvd out yet"
,pickled_egg,2010-11-29T06:21Z,"it's the DVD rip converted to 720p (resolution is no guarantee of quality)

Still blocky & blurs when camera moves

download the 1.4gig version & you can't tell the difference

Best played on screen no bigger than 19inch "
,pReStOn_C,2010-11-29T10:08Z,"A thought, why not download the sample file first before downloading the complete torrent, unless it's been rar'd etc... then make your own judgment from there as to wether or not to download? to be honest the 1.4gig version is the better in my opinion, but also depending on wether you are watching via a CRT, LED, LCD or PLASMA all make a difference..."
,yopepoy,2010-11-29T15:54Z,^ your fucking right men. don't listen to those noob downloader who doesn't even seed.
,karlo94,2010-11-29T20:24Z,"pls seed.. nobody bites here :D
(if you seed, you will get cookie)"
,pickled_egg,2010-11-29T22:35Z,"Hey yopepoy. Who you calling noobs that don't seed.
I have currently uploaded 18.3 Gig on this shit.
The only thing I got wrong earlier is I said It's a converted version of the 1.4Gig DVDRip.
I should have said It's a Conversion of the 1.4Gig TS thats claiming to be a DVDRip

It is slightly worse than the original 1.4Gig version so do yourself a favour. Save yourself 1gig of download & get the 1.4Gig version.
If you check the Samples they are the same except this one is slightly more blurred after being converted to 720p"
