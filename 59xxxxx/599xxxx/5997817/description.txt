Acceleration functions include Entropy Decode, Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform, Hardware Motion Compensation and Subpicture Alpha Blending units.

If "Hardware Acceleration" is enabled, some systems might display subtitles incorrectly. This is because the display driver only supports an old format of the Microsoft DXVA interface. It is recommended that you install the latest drivers from the original card/chip maker in order for this function to work flawlessly.

CyberLink PowerDVD 10 is fully optimized for multimedia instruction sets, such as AMD 3D Now! Professional, Enhanced 3D Now!, 3DNow!, Intel Streaming SIMD Extensions 2/3/4 (SSE/2/3/4), MMX, the Hyper-Threading technology, dual-core and quar-core CPU supported.

CyberLink PowerDVD 10 is compatible with all Centrino, Socket 478, Socket 423, Socket 370, Slot 1, Socket A and Slot A chipsets from Intel, VIA, SiS, ALi, NVIDIA, and AMD.

General Playback Performance and Quality Issues

External subtitle loading: For loading external subtitles, you should name the subtitle file with the same file name as the playback video file.

DMA Mode

It is HIGHLY recommended that you enable the DMA function of your DVD-ROM in order to reduce CPU loading when accessing DVDs. Windows XP contains built-in DMA support.

Display Issues

To ensure that CyberLink PowerDVD works properly, please install DirectX version 9.0 or higher.

Deinterlace Issues

CyberLink smart deinterlace is sophisticated video processing technologies that requires more CPU power. If both bit stream analysis method and pixel adaptive are used, it is recommended that you use at least a 1.8 GHz system for optimal performance.

Blu-ray Disc Playback Capability and Limitation

   * Due to the high computation requirement for Blu-ray Discs, you may experience some video quality drop, frame drops or lower performance on particular titles. Make sure your hardware meets the minimum system requirements for Blu-ray Disc playback.
   * It is also recommended that all non-critical applications are closed before starting Blu-ray Disc playback. Full CPU/GPU clock-rate is reserved for CyberLink PowerDVD Blu-ray Disc playback.
   * Blu-ray Disc playback on an external monitor via a DVI/HDMI connector requires an HDCP capable display device.
   * Advanced Access Content System (AACS) is supported for commercial content playback. Occasional renewals of AACS keys are required. An Internet connection is required for this operation.

3D Playback

3D Playback Warning: if you experience headaches, dizziness, nausea, blurry eyesight or other symptoms while watching 3D video content, it is highly recommended that you stop playback immediately and see your doctor.
TrueTheaterâ„¢ - Technology Related Issues

TrueTheaterâ„¢ Technology (HD/Motion/Lighting/Stretch) are sophisticated video processing technologies that require higher CPU power. If TrueTheaterâ„¢ HD or TrueTheaterâ„¢ Motion is enabled (especially in conjunction with other audio effects), it is recommended that you use at least a 2.0 GHz system for optimal performance. CyberLink PowerDVD 10 can dynamically adjust the TrueTheaterâ„¢ technology (HD/Motion/Lighting) for users according to CPU usage.

TrueTheaterâ„¢ Technology is implemented within a CyberLink proprietary video decoder. Thus, this technology is not available when hardware video acceleration is enabled.

TrueTheaterâ„¢ Technology is also not available under Blu-ray Disc playback due to the limitation of platform horsepower.
