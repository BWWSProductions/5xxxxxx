,DaNtsu,2010-12-18T13:29Z,"thanks for heads up 666. 
theyre either hardcoded (= youre fucked) or just added externally, in that case you can rightclick and deactivate the subtitles"
,Piet1881,2010-12-21T04:26Z,"DrBhup666 is right. There are french subs and they are hardcoded, but the quality is fine.
So thanks to the uploader, althou mentioning the
subs would have been nice.
