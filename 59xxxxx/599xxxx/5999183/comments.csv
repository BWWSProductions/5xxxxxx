Can I ask you a few books if they are easy to find and also if you think there is an interest about them?
There are 3 books called ''Antennas Made of Wires''
Volume 1, 2 & 3 by L. B. Cebik, W4RNL
The site is      http://www.antennex.com/Sshack/wire/wire.html
There are also 3 books  called ''FEEDING ANTENNAS''
Volumes 1, 2 & 3
The site is    http://www.antennex.com/Sshack/feeding/feeding.htm
Again, thank you very much for all your interesting uploads. "

That said, if Malestrom_HH can get these books, they will surely be much appreciated."
