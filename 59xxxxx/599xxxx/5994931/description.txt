"There Will Be Bad Blood"

It's Thanksgiving in Langley Falls, and as 
usual, Stan invites his half-brother, Rusty 
(guest voice Phillips), over to show off his 
cornucopia of wealth and good fortune. But 
when Stan finds out that Rusty is far 
wealthier than he led on, Stan tries to take 
from Rusty what he feels is rightfully his. 
Things don't go well, and the Smith family 
nearly loses it all

Enjoy :)
