The movie is good to begin with. It's made for tv, so it isn't graphic, but it tells a compelling story and Brian Dennehy is excellent as Gacy. But all VHS copies (when you can ever find them) are the truncated 90 minute version. This is the 3 hour cut that I remember seeing.

Audio is crystal clear, and considering that this was originally made for tv, the video quality is good too.

I never thought I would find this. Thank you!"

Considering that this programme was originally made-for-television it has transferred brilliantly.
