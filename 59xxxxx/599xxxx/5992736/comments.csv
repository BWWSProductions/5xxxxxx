,kaitoukid44,2010-11-30T10:20Z,"there was a problem on running this game saying about

1.""The program can't start because d3dx9.43.dll is missing from you computer""

the second error is

2.""the ordinal 12404 could not be located in the dynamic link library mfc90u.dll""

i tried to fix the 1st problem by downloading the ""d3dx9.43.dll"" in some site and paste it to the game dictionary but when i start the game it crashed to desktop and an error pops out

""the applications has encountered an error and has closed. please check if  your hardware is sufficient to run this application""

i end up nothing to run this game..so anyone knows about this?"

,megodtoo,2010-12-13T15:48Z,"kaitoukid44, ""Get rid of the file you downloaded""
Do a fresh install, making sure all files in the directory are removed
d3dx9.43.dll error is only because Direct X needs updating. Go to the directory  Program Files (x86)\THQ\MX vs ATV Reflex\Installers and double click on DXSETUP.exe
It should now update and will run.
Mine had same error till I updated with instruction above.
Good luck"

,fredrikleo,2011-02-13T12:22Z,"I have a problem. At first i downloaded the torrent and installed it to my external harddisk, instead of the one on the computer. It worked fine. Then i quited, and turned my PC off. After turning it on and were going to play, it shutted down and this message came up: ""The application has encountered an error and has closed.Please check if your hardware is sufficient to run this application."" I've tried to reinstall in both on the external and the computers harddisk. I extracted from winrar and mounted and did everything over. HELP?"
