ItÂ´s possible??"
,AveryWeb,2010-11-30T05:30Z,"urgate,

There is no viruses in these files! I am running them on my computer right now and have no warnings and I have tested them in 5 different virus programs and have used them for 4 months before I uploaded them.

It is a false alarm with your program! You can download with ease knowing you are safe!"

Can anyone more experienced than med check this out?"

,AveryWeb,2011-01-17T18:28Z,"Ad aware says that for most of the dll files.

As my post stated above:

I AM RUNNING THIS ON MY COMP WITH NO ISSUES!!!!!

If your program is telling you there is something you got a piece of junk cause I am not infected.

If you are that worried that do not download."
