,dannyfromnb,2011-02-05T18:22Z,"No its highly unsafe, this torrent has what's known as complosion virus... if you dowload it, your computer will explode and kill you! 

No but seriously theres no such thing as a safe torrent to dowload, all torrent tracker's keeps a log of your IP address. Although this is USUALLY harmless, the worse that would normally happen is that the copyright holder would send an email to your ISP saying you are downloading pirated material and you would get a letter in the mail telling you to stop it.

Theres so many torrents and so many million dowloaders that the chances for you to get in trouble are minor.. and if you are conserned about safety, you can always operate on a proxy, then you are anonymous. As far as the files go, have an antivirus and your usually fairly safe. So stop worrying and start stealing lol."
,dolphinsmarlins1,2011-02-06T06:55Z,"haha. stealing seems so wrong... how about we use the word ""sharing""?  i know that there is always some risk when downloading, but i like to take precautions... green and pink bones make me feel better."
