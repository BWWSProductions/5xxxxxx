Notes
=====
This is, for whatever reason, fairly difficult to obtain cleanly on the interwebs. Here is the full COD:BO soundtrack, as scored by Sean Murray. It is the musical soundtrack to the game. Musical score has become a fundamental part of video games, and if you have played Black Ops, you have experienced these tunes, sometimes without even being aware of it.

Don't be like me, and expecting some kick-ass CoD credit or commercial tunes from Eminem and Rolling Stones, this is not THAT soundtrack. This isn't a bad soundtrack - - its just the original music made for the game. God knows I am looking for something that included the music in the end credits!"
