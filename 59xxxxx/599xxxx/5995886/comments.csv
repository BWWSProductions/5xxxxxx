,flynndownunder,2011-09-19T11:48Z,"This ones been up for almost a year and no comment on the movie yet. Shame on you all. I've downloaded other copies and this is brilliant. Comes in three .avi files as you'd expect for a 2GB movie, but WOW it is worth it. The definition is hugely better than the 800MB or so copies, which I've since deleted. It looks brilliant on a 50"" Plasma (after converting it using ConvertXtoDVD if you have the time). If you like Marlon Brando or war movies then do this one. It's 2Gig so you should seed for longer as I am, there are others bothering to let it run for awhile, they obviously have enjoyed it.
