,Togican,2010-12-01T10:18Z,"what does it mean ""ap25 patched"" , we can play it without upgrading custom firmware or do we still need the new ap25 firmware?"
,darklordz,2010-12-08T13:50Z,"Yes, you need ixtreme LT +. This patch is from ABGX, which is needed to run AP25 games with LT +."

,andreyvul,2011-06-24T19:56Z,"@shanepee: /path/to/abgx360 -av IMAGE.iso

Note: this AP25 data is for 12625 series dashboard.
It will not work on 13146. Use abgx360 to fix ap25 before playing in new dash."
