Summary:-

"A mixture of unbelievable footage and unforgettable characters, Hardliners goes out to sea with Australian long line fishermen who risk it all for every catch, and for their families.
Chasing huge fish, these fishermen must also navigate their way around massive tanker ships and bulk carriers, while dealing with shocking storms and enormous seas, one wrong move could end it all!"

Notes From KaLaNco69e:-

Looks like a promising show. It's like the Australian version of "Swords - Life on the Line", except their Target species is the YellowFin Tuna

I'm normally not one to cap shows, but it seems no-body else is capping this show.

Still trying to Suss everything out, so bear with me!!

First Episode is 352 x 288 DivX Format, 25fps, 1050kbps, 4:3 (Only recorded in EP mode)
Second Episode is 720x576 DivX Format, 25fps, 1050kbps, 4:3 (still can't record in 16:9?!)

Anyways, here's hoping you appreciate my time, and Show it by seeding!!
