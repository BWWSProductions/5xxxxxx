,keithasdf,2011-01-24T09:10Z,"i can't play it on Windows Media Player, do i need a different codec to play??
i can play with the media player classic from K lite i guess, but i hate the quality, cause the picture always choppy when the scene is really fast.
dunno the version of the K lite, should be close to recent.
thanks!"
