Geum-ja (Lee Young-ae), a beautiful girl who cannot help but draw attention of all the men around her, was first introduced to the public as the one responsible for the abduction and murder of a little boy at the age of twenty. Being so young and pretty, her horrific crime drew national media attention. But now, 13 years have passed and in that time, Geum-ja has been the most hardworking and model prisoner, earning the nickname "sweet" Geum-ja. "Sweet" Geum-ja, however, has not been idle during her time in prison. For 13 years, she plotted revenge against her former teacher, Mr. Baek (Choi Min-sik). Her kindness while in "the joint" has paid off and has now gained many friends and allies. Now that Geum-ja is getting out of jail, she is ready to put her carefully conceived plan into action. What happened between Geum-ja and her teacher 13 years ago? Why does she want revenge? And how will her quest for vengeance end? These are the mysteries of SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE.
