IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO: Harry.Potter.und.die.Heiligtuemer.des.Todes.Teil.1.TELESYNC.German.720p.x264-PFD
AUDIO: OWN

Here we go with a decent TS of potter... at last :P For the video we used PFD's video, which was pretty nice... but still had issues like too dark, colouring etc... but still 100x better than all other cams. The audio is our own line and pretty decent line if we so say. So for this it was a case of fixing up the video... brightness, sharpness, rgb colours, white balance and after that syncing our line to the video. Overall not too be for a TS and more than likely best source until that screener gets leaked properly. Video is still very dark in places and also the contrast is off, but didn't have much choice IF you wanted to see what was going on.

Just to show you what we mean about how dark the source was... please check source screenshot below:
