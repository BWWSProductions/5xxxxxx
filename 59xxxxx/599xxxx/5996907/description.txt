Curvemeister. (32 & 64bit)

The Curves command in Photoshop is vital for getting the tones and colour balance of your images right. Curvemeister gives you a much improved interface, allowing you to look at all of the channel curves for an image at the same time, as well as giving a more precise view of each on there own. It also gives a clear display
of the histogram and improved mouse control over changing the curve shape.
