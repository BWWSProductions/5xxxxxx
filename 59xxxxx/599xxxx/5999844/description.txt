Allmusic Review:
The Christmas Album is GleeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fifth release in 2010, and the first of two full-length albums to be issued in November alone. Appearing several weeks after another holiday-themed record -- The Rocky Horror Glee Show -- it features a handful of wintertime tunes, from the standard crop of Christmas carols to more secular fare like Frank LoesserÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Baby, ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cold OutsideÃ¢â‚¬Â and the CarpentersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Merry Christmas Darling.Ã¢â‚¬Â Most of the carols are what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d expect: slick, sentimental, and performed in GleeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s familiar Broadway-pop style, with solos by the cast members and backup vocals by a group of unseen professionals. Other songs are Ã¢â‚¬Å“jazzed upÃ¢â‚¬Â to a questionable degree, including an urban mash-up of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Deck the HallsÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Up on the RooftopÃ¢â‚¬Â that sounds like something from a Disney starletÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s catalog. On Ã¢â‚¬Å“O Holy Night,Ã¢â‚¬Â though, Lea Michele belts out the high notes like the second coming of Kristin Chenoweth, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Baby, ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cold OutsideÃ¢â‚¬Â melts under the warmth of Chris ColferÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s duet with Darren Criss, who plays KurtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s openly gay love interest. A duet between two male characters -- with lyrics like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gosh, your lips look delicious,Ã¢â‚¬Â no less -- is a refreshingly risquÃƒÂ© move for Fox TV, not to mention an album highlight. After all, Glee became popular by pushing boundaries and ignoring convention, so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reassuring to see the spark still burning.
