thanks a million :D"
[T],insinuendo,2010-11-28T20:28Z,"LOL!

If I'd be looking for recognition, I wouldn't post at TPB :)

Enjoy this collection HMV!"
,-wiggidy-,2010-11-29T04:55Z,"Finally, this is posted as a torrent. Thanks a million."
,dpance,2010-12-12T14:42Z,"Well, first and foremost a million thanks and massive positive Karma must be bestowed upon insinuendo.  I've downloaded other MFSL classic albums and have enjoyed the rich vinyl sound thoroughly.

Just finished downloading this collection successfully and I'm getting errors when trying to listen to the flac files or when I attempt to decode using Flac Frontend.  I'm a fairly savvy computer user and no stranger to torrenting or The Pirate Bay.

What am I doing wrong here?  As mentioned, the 11gig download went without a hitch.  All the album art opens up nicely but no music for me...

Thank you AGAIN insinuendo for your time and effort."
,dpance,2010-12-13T16:36Z,"Operator error as suspected.  I figure my problem is with the 24-bit/96kHz part of this fine upload.

Anyway, I used another software package called Switch to play as well as convert the files to .wav and don't have a problem at all.  Everything sounds killer!  Getting re-acquainted with Abbey Road after all these years.

Thanks again insinuendo !!!!!!"
,thermal_audio,2010-12-18T03:05Z,"thanks for you work.  not just this one.
very important to capture original mixes when they're good.

jumping jack flash by the rolling stones was never really released as a track on a regularly released album.

it was really a single only but appears on ""best ofs"" and collections.

i'm wondering if the quality of the single is superior to that of the compliation LPs?
"
[T],insinuendo,2010-12-23T11:24Z,"Again, read the description.

This is 24/96 and requires adequate software, or must be burned to DVD. This is NOT redbook.

I recommend foobar2000 http://www.foobar2000.org/"
,ogchris,2010-12-24T16:42Z,@ insinuendo.  Thank you for sharing this absolutely amazing collection.  The quality is beyond comparison. 
,agonzz,2010-12-30T22:55Z,Wow!  Sounds great.  A million thanks.
[V],Murlok,2010-12-31T09:55Z,Great Work THX :)
,Zarkow,2011-01-03T18:26Z,"Awesome share. A note, most people might play this great FLAC release of The Beatles on the computer, but if you want to put it on your cell phone etc you might have to convert it to a MP3.

If you wanna try a Beta of a free tool called zAudioConverter, that does this. http://www.digitalsoftware.se/forum/viewtopic.php?t=289&tag=zaudioconverter_beta_released_"
,orionkarate,2011-02-13T05:28Z,"People should read this letter from the truely author Dr.Ebbert: http://www.beatleswiki.com/wiki/index.php/Dr._Ebbetts_Retires_from_the_Beatles_Remastering_Business.

With all respect, the name of Dr. is Ebbetts, not Robert.

In the mail (link above), Dr. Ebbetts stated the reason why he decided to cease his works.

Honestly, I am just a listener and Dr. Ebbetts said the official remasters release is superior, so I think, maybe its quality is better."
,Gigantix,2011-02-13T21:25Z,"Thanks a lot, sounds great. "
,Justmetoo,2011-03-14T21:31Z,Thanks a million insinuendo. I finished the download yesterday and today i converted some of the albums to MP3 320kbps to transfer to my iPhone but something is not working right. The conversion process using All2Mp3 for Mac behaves correctly but when the job is done (super fast way too fast) the resulting Mp3 file is 0kb...no data in the Mp3 file. Any idea why? The flac file is perfect and plays perfectly also.
,Chromie192,2011-04-02T04:55Z,This torrent brings me so much joy. Seriously you and HMVinyl are the best. I have downloaded most if not all of your FLAC music files. 
,thksp,2011-04-04T01:14Z,Dr Robert and Dr. Ebbets are not the same person. The Dr. Ebbets' rips that I know of (and have) are 16/44.1 and these are 24/96.
,jonviljar,2011-05-15T03:39Z,Fantastic. I am speechless. I literally have no speech.
,XxM24Ty,2011-07-16T05:13Z,"I have the 2009 Remixes in wave/Audio CD made from the Flac recordings posted on this forum. I am very proud of the collection I have as it is, In what ways can this collection sound better than the popular 2009 flac collection? I mean I can hear things in the 2009 remixes I could never hear before, and am very impressed by it. I am not impressed by records. "
,XxM24Ty,2011-07-16T05:26Z,"Nevermind, I just found my answer in the FAQ for the media player advised to use: ""Does foobar2000 sound better than other players?

No. Most of â€œsound quality differencesâ€ people â€œhearâ€ are placebo effect (at least with real music), as actual differences in produced sound data are below their noise floor (1 or 2 last bits in 16bit samples). foobar2000 has sound processing features such as software resampling or 24bit output on new high-end soundcards, but most of the other mainstream players are capable of doing the same by now.""

Come on people, they even admit it's a ""placebo effect""!! Like a sugar pill."
,thksp,2011-08-04T19:59Z,"If you have good sound equipment then try this files and then you can judge for yourself, if not, don't boither. You may not be able to hear the difference (also note that 2009 remasters and MFSL are different materings)"
,Bruzem,2011-10-30T18:45Z,"Thanks, astonishing quality......!!"
,_kewlCat,2011-11-28T19:18Z,"The good Dr. Robert ROCKS, thanks Doc!!! Since the 60's, I have had every one of these LPs scratched, stolen, or wasted. Now, the Doc offers them a perfect, ""unscratchable"", long lasting format. "
,_kewlCat,2011-11-28T19:21Z,"PS: haha, FK R1AA_Sheit_Redbook piss poor quality; just caught the below comment, thanks a million doc!!!!!!

>>>> This is 24/96 and requires adequate software, or must be burned to DVD. This is NOT redbook."
,_kewlCat,2011-11-28T19:37Z,"Final comment... 

Foobar2000 Kills Winamp and makes an incredible sonic difference at 24/96. Winamp does not do 24/96 justice, not one iota.

Listen to FLAC 24/96 quality with the correct app to know how great the Dr is...

http://www.foobar2000.org/ 

You'll thank the Doc if you do..."
,Flubly,2012-03-19T23:22Z,"Everything sounds great except Sergeant Pepper. I'm getting distortion on the treble in almost every track. It isn't constant, almost acts like clipping. Does anyone else have that problem? I am playing them in foobar2000."
,MixedUpZombie,2012-03-21T05:29Z,"I came. Seriously, more people like Dr. Robert here need to do Vinyl discographies. +1"
,MixedUpZombie,2012-04-27T23:17Z,"This torrent is AMAZING. My only complaint is that on the later half of sgt. peppers, sometimes there's a faint buzzing sound. Still, the quality is perfect. Almost no pops in the audio. "
