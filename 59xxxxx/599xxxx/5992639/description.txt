mattyboi1995 NOTES
Ok so i made a script using Gordian Knot to re-size and sharpen. I then dropped it into vdubmod, i lowered the saturation, increased the gamma & contrast slightly. I also used a de-noise filter then i changed the colours with a RGB EQ.

credit mattyboi1995 & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
