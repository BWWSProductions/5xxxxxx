Unfortunately there is no season 7 (or higher) avaible :/

,Dramat,2010-12-01T22:27Z,"It redirects you to btmon site - torrent from that site was invalid for your p2p client?
"
,Dramat,2010-12-02T15:07Z,"Damn, now when I've opened link from my torrent desription, proper torrent was second one. I can't put here link to the direct site, because I get ""Database-error' all the time.

Proper Dynasty torrent season 5, is the one in category ""Movies"" - not ""TV series"". Someone whom add it there picked wrong category, but torrent itself works gr8. Just open it in new window and click in green button 'download' next to btmon site sign (in the top of the page). It'll redirect you to the site with torrent - at the bottom you can download it.

Sorry for all the inconvenience!"
,Dramat,2010-12-02T16:33Z,"Wow, what a mess.

Try dl torrent in TV Series category as well. Something wierd is going on at that site lol
