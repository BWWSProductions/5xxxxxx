This is a legal torrent for the data CD included free with Lois McMaster Bujold's book _Cryoburn_.  The books, interviews, forewords, and images are made available to us through her generosity and the generosity of her publisher Baen Books.  We may read, copy, and share them as much as we like as long as we do not sell them.  Thanks, guys!  We love you!

* I believe this should read Forewords, but I am replicating it as it reads in the file.
** Yes, there are two copies of Diplomatic Immunity on the CD.  I suspect this was an error.
