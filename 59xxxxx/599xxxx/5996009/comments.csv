,club1820,2010-12-10T06:21Z,"I'm a newbie to Wii bootlegs so be nice. :) 

does the console need to be hacked or can I just dl and rip to dvd and then play?  way back I hacked my playstation with a mod chip and used bootlegs that way. stopped gaming for awhile but now have kids and wii.  So any help in this area would be appreciated."
,mb_webguy,2010-12-12T21:39Z,"club1820: Your Wii has to be modded.  Software modding and hardware modding generally work equally well, but software modding is cheaper and not terribly difficult if you're able to follow directions.  It's also reversible if you do it correctly, and the risk of bricking your machine (if you follow the directions correctly) is fairly small"
,mb_webguy,2010-12-12T21:44Z,club1820: I recommend the Barnitos Softmod pack from HackMyWii.net
,naruto71730,2010-12-13T04:59Z,"It'd be nice, if the people that first downloaded this, FUCKING SEEDED!!! It's the fuckers that hit and run on torrents for games that piss a lot of people off."

,naruto71730,2010-12-17T04:21Z,"@xixcxex

Try putting the game on a USB loader. Don't know what a USB loader is? Google is your friend. Worked on Configurable USB loader.

@shady_76

Just deny the update. It's simple. "
