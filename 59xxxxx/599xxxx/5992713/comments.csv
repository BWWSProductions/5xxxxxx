Everyone else tried to use the screener and then edit there own cam into it and they all sucked. I highly recommend this download. Its little dark in some spots but over all watchable. Thanx Miguel, you really out did yourself.

Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file.

Not only with windows media but any other player as well. "

This is part #1. part #2 will be out sometime next year.

@jill828607
I suggest you get VLC Media Player. It plays any video format you have.

@minemine101
For burning an AVI to a DVD, I use WINavi Converter then use DVDfab to burn the DVD files to a disc.

@Torrent
I haven't downloaded this yet, but by reading the comments and looking at the SCREENS, it seems decent for an early recording. Can't wait till the PPRip comes out.

,foxboy23,2010-12-06T18:54Z,Awesome Quality thanks for the upload man
,tyson18,2010-12-08T04:23Z,please seed downloading very slow
,downloader979,2010-12-09T01:21Z,"I know everyone says this, but i think this is the best release so far. audio is perfectly in sync, and video is at least as good as all other releases (and smallest file size). I think this is better than the matt/kindom release, which seems to be the most popular. audio is in better sync, and doesnt sound distant. Just my 2 cents. Thanks for the u/l!"
,fongy74,2010-12-09T15:40Z,"This uppy is about the best your'e gonna get at the moment,watchable A7.V7..If you can't wait to see this at the cinema it's well worth downloading.Thanks Miguel."
,GaryR46953,2010-12-10T22:29Z,"this is great, but I'm still gona buy the dvd to support the artists."
,RickyTheFish,2010-12-11T12:42Z,"Not bad for a TS. The audio is in sync throughout the entirety of the film, and so far I haven't noticed any horribly distracting audio or video errors. The video is a bit dark, and the audio is a bit quiet and tinny, but it's definitely watchable. On a 10-scale, I'd say maybe:

A: 8
V: 7

Thanks for the upload, miguel1983. Good on ya, mate."
,jizzingdog,2010-12-11T22:43Z,omg its sooooo fast thank you!!!!!!!!
,tokm-nikita,2010-12-12T03:04Z,The large video file doesn't open. Right clicking gives only limited options (no Rename or Delete e.g.) The small Sample file does open. What should be done?
,tokm-nikita,2010-12-12T03:10Z,I was able to rename it with a dos developed program. Afterwards all was normal. Strange. Any explanation?
,crook01,2010-12-14T20:40Z,"congratulations and thanks to whoever camed this. it is quite possibly the best cam in the world.

,Kanano,2011-06-22T13:13Z,"A tip for not getting caught for downloading this: Right after it finishes, open the folder and rename the movie file to something else, like H 1 or something. It also might help if you convert the file to another file size, using Winavi or something (crack is on tpb). 



Every time I get a copyright infringement notice, they always have every little detail about the movie, down to a tee, so changing the info will make it seem like you got something different. It worked when I downloaded Unstoppable. "
