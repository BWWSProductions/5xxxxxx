mattyboi1995 NOTES
Ok so i dropped into vdub. I lowered the saturation, increased the brigthness and contrast. I sorted the colours using a RGB EQ, i also used a de-noise filter. Finaly i sharpened. The video is a bit blury but ok for a cam. The audio is hollow and not to good. Thanks to LU for putting the english audio out there.
