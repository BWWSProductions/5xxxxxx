[V],prashant22,2010-11-30T18:50Z,"@all
welcome..

and jarman ya i would hv posted this in the morning itself bt when 3 hrs of encoding was left lights went off..so had to start all over again..."
,i_am_sid,2010-11-30T21:51Z,"@prashant
How much time does it take you to encode a movie? And how much time to upload the same?"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-01T02:07Z,"@sid
IT takes abt 20 hrs or more to encoded a 2 hr movie..
Ofcourse I hv a slow pc that's why it takes time..
And abt 9-10 hrs to upload a 700mb movie.."
,jarman007,2010-12-01T02:28Z,"damn 

it must be frustrating to start again after 9-10 hours of encoding

you are doing a great job........keep up the good work
"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-01T02:45Z,Ya its very frustrating...more frustrating when u r so close to completion and lights r cut..
,i_am_sid,2010-12-01T03:26Z,"@prashant
what!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Are you serious??????That much patience and efforts !!!!!!overall its takes more than a day, to upload a movie. 
And, God, I didnt asked the time taken to download the source. I guess a day more!!!!!!!
Im speechless. Salute you buddy.
"
,DSIN,2010-12-01T04:12Z,"Iam surprised..that all of u guys r dloading these encoded movies for so long & never knew that it takes a day or more to encode.. 
even a 5 min music video takes half an hour to encode (& i have a pretty fast pc)
@prashant : ty for the movie dude...
i hav a question though...
wat do u do with the source after encoding that movie... i mean do u keep em or delete them?"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-01T04:16Z,"@sid
Ya overall it takes 2 days...sometimes 2 nd half days if source is big like 6.5gb..."
,DSIN,2010-12-01T04:31Z,"& yeah powercuts r so fking common in india... thats y encoding on pc is very hectic work..
(if only i had a laptop LOL)
keep up the good work anyways... :D "
[V],prashant22,2010-12-01T04:47Z,"@DSIN
Many people don't know..even I didn't knew..it was only when I started encoding I came to know..
That's why I cannot control my anger when some people say don't waste ur time its already done..they don't realise how much patience n effort it takes to do one single movie..although now I don't care what some people say because many love my work nd wait for my uploads..and this is the only thing that keeps me going..

Unfortunately I hv to delete the source..I only hv 480gb of hard disk.."
,ashu21,2010-12-01T04:49Z,"@prashant: I hav a request,pls do step up in 5.1 channel.....plssss......"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-01T05:13Z,"@ashu
Don't worry abt that..my next 2 uploads step up 3 and then 3 idiots will be in 5.1 audio.."
[T],MitZep,2010-12-01T05:49Z,hey is ratatouille on you list??
,himansu_007,2010-12-01T06:12Z,"I hv done an inception by putting the idea of 5.1 ch sound
in prashant's mind at the beginning stage of his ripping..
 i think that inception didnt work out bt now i think the idea has grown up in his mind as he is doing so :)

just kidding bro dont mind :) "
[V],prashant22,2010-12-01T06:18Z,"@mitzep
NO its nt in my list.."
[V],prashant22,2010-12-01T06:24Z,"@himansu
Ha Ha.."
,hello_rickoo,2010-12-01T07:17Z,hi prashant..thanks for the upload dude..hey guys i think we all should contribute & pay back in return to prashant for what he's doing for us..lets gift him 1TB harddisk by contributing..which way i dont know..ideas plzz.
,jarman007,2010-12-01T07:18Z,"@prashant

u said u will do 5.1 audio in movies that are very good

3 idiots is a great movie imo......but step up 3 is just a average movie

although it is not likely that i will download step up 3 .....so do as you like

but do only very good movies in 5.1 audio......as for people like me (who don't have these speakers)  it only increases the size


damn you himanshu for performing the inception.....lol .....just kidding"
,ashu21,2010-12-01T07:21Z,@prashant:thanx bro..wl wait 4 ur release..
,hello_rickoo,2010-12-01T07:21Z,you know I feel you are god among uploaders..I mean 720p with 5.1ch & that too under 700mb!! that's nobody's cup of tea even among the very famous uploaders..hats off to you..
[V],prashant22,2010-12-01T08:03Z,"@hello_rickoo
thanks for ur gift bt dude really no need of gifts...i m happy to upload movies thats why i do this...u just enjoy the movies...

@jarman
buddy ya bt actually step up needs 6ch audio because it contains many dance sequences thats why i m doing it in 5.1...
also i think 3 idiots will be the one and only bollywood movie that i'll do in 6ch..."
,aashu0409,2010-12-01T08:28Z,"Thanx

Downloading now
nd waiting for Transformers-2
please do it soon"
,muthineni,2010-12-01T09:01Z,"thank you prashanth...been busy for a while. so couldnt comment..
thank you for this ( still in queue) , easy a, other guys.. quality is the usual 10/10.
 n checked ur list in older comments.. good one .i think an uploader has to balance new, popular and highly rated movies well.titanic and requiem from a dream on the same list .lol.. very smart buddy.

@ all --trust me u dont want go with the public or critics alone..amores peres a  highly rated spanish movie really pissed me off.. while i was confused after seeing twilght.. how is that a hit novel and why was there a craze for the movie and its sequels..wtf . it means we gotta try few in both categories.
  i might go out away for another week now. so
adios"
,jarman007,2010-12-01T09:03Z,"ok
thanks for replying

3 idiots is the best bollywood movie i have ever seen........so make it a great upload like inception"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-01T09:43Z,"@muthineni
Welcome.."
,himansu_007,2010-12-01T09:47Z,"Jarman
5.1didnt make a big size just 60-80 MB more or less i think thats not a big deal..
What u say?"
,jarman007,2010-12-01T10:44Z,"@himansu
ya its not a big deal

by the way prashant said it increased the size by 150mb in inception"
,DSIN,2010-12-01T15:15Z,^ its [THANX] x [â]  IMO :D
,DSIN,2010-12-01T20:41Z,@mzk : i do the same thing u mentioned... i burn a LOT of dvd's ...  cuz i dload too much of anime/movies/music .. 2-3 gb avg a day..(thats too much at 60k avg speed) .
[V],prashant22,2010-12-02T04:12Z,"@mzk
I just start the encoding and do my normal work as usual...
I keep my encodes for my collection because I can burn 5 of my encodes to a dvd..it is cheaper..I nt only hv movies to burn bt games as well so I too burn a lot of dvds.."
