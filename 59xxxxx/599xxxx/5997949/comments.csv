,ashlee87,2010-12-07T03:50Z,1.09G?? Since when is a 40min show 1gig? Its not. This is more then double the amount it should be. Not worth the download people. There are plenty of other copies out there ranging from 150 mb and a little up. Disappointing TvTeam.

and to me it's woth it"
[T],apels1nen,2010-12-22T13:17Z,"ashlee87, the file is 1.09Gb because it's 720p (HD). 720p means 720 horizontal lines are used to create your TV picture. The p stands for progressive scanning, a technique that scans and displays all of the lines at the same time in one single pass on the screen."
