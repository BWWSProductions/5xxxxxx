Following up 2009's platinum-selling 'Against All Odds' with an added sense of togetherness and musical maturity, 'Love.Live'Life' is the third album from London-based hip hop three-piece N-Dubz. Including the single 'Best Behaviour' and featuring Skepta on 'So Alive', the blend of rapping from Dappy and Fazer and Tulisa's vibrant vocals once again proves to be success for the group
