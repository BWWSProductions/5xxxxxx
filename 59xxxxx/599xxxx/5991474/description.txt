In 1961 London, Jenny Mellor is a 16-year-old schoolgirl who is on track to enter Oxford University when she meets a charming older man, David Goldman, who pursues her romantically. He takes her to concerts, clubs, and fine restaurants, and easily charms Jenny's parents into approving of the relationship. When Jenny recognizes that David is a con man who makes money through a variety of shady practices, she is initially shocked but silences her misgivings in the face of David's persuasive charm.

When David proposes marriage, Jenny accepts and drops out of school just before taking her A-levels. She then discovers that David is already married. When she confronts him, he at first makes excuses and then vanishes. Jenny despairs, feeling she has thrown her life away, but with the help of her favourite teacher, resumes her studies and is accepted at Oxford the following year. The film concludes with Jenny at Oxford, remarking in a voiceover that "I probably looked as wide-eyed, fresh, and artless as any other student. But I wasn't."
