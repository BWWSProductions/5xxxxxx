As Christmas draws near, Jack discovers what it truly means to come home

Stephen Curtis Chapman stars in his first film.

William R. Moses (Falcon Crest, Perry Mason) stars as an emotionally barren man who rediscovers the meaning of Christmas in this heartwarming holiday film based on a short story by Christian author and pastor Max Lucado.

Hoping for a respite from his shaky marriage to wife Meg (Megan Follows), Chicago journalist Jack Davenport (Moses) travels on assignment to a small town in Texas to investigate a mysterious nativity scene.

With the help of a local minister (contemporary Christian recording star Steven Curtis Chapman in his first acting role), Jack begins to unravel the mystery and finds himself on a healing journey of self-discovery that reaffirms his passion for life, love, family, and the holiday season.
