[V],twentyforty,2010-11-27T11:01Z,"No, dammit. I told you yesterday exact file-size, explained why cannot be small and - BTW - 6ch brings 90 MB only."
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-27T11:02Z,"@hkoraddi: Answer was for you.
"
[V],twentyforty,2010-11-27T11:23Z,"@hkoraddi: Well, I should add that I don't plan re-doing Step Up 3 again. Frankly, I would never know why I done it at all. Here is my answer yesterday, where I pointed you to already placed request for specific format. And you've asked after prank0007 and I have established format already.

In ENCODING - it would be 1 GB 480p (it must be so big 'cause of the content - lot of crowded scenes, group dancing, et.c).""
