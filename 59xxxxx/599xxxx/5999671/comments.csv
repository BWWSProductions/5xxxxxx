,tornPOP,2010-12-12T03:51Z,"I understand why people use .mkv but you limit people. You can watch an Xvid on a PC, XBOX360, and PS3. I can watch an Xvid on my home DVD player because it plays Divx/Xvid. The .mkv may look nice at a better compression, but the benefits of using Xvid outweigh the .mkv codec."

,StankyPirate,2011-03-15T19:10Z,"Hey Nazsan, and other newbies; Don't you have a broadband internet connection and a browser? Have you ever heard of Google? Get off your lazy ass and search for any unknown file extensions and Learn! Using only Windows media player proves you have yet to harness or realize the Power of the internet. If you have a mind, use it. 
Search for media players, some I recommend are Jet Audio, BS Player, Winamp, The KM Player, Quicktime and RealPlayer, to name a few. "

I think the video is very bad quality, the blacks are terrible, it looks more like a copied VHS tape. The sound is also in a pretty poor stereo quality. Personally I don't think it's worth the download but others may disagree.

Thanks anyway."
