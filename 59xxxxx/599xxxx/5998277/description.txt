George Baker Selection - Little Green Bag [promo].VOB



HQ rare promo music video. "Little Green Bag" is a 1969 song written by Dutch musicians, Jan Visser and George Baker (credited as Hans Bouwens), and recorded by the George Baker Selection at the band's own cost. The 7" single debut of the George Baker Selection was released by the label Negram, which misprinted the actual title of the song, which is "Little Green Back (greenback meaning money) and "greenback" is the lyric actually sung. This has caused the song to be misnamed ever since. The B-side was "Pretty Little Dreamer". 

The song reached the number 9 position in the Dutch Top 40, and the number 3 position in Belgium. In the summer of 1970, it reached the number 16 position on the Cash Box magazine chart and 21 in the Billboard Top 100 in the U.S.. In 1992, when the song was used in the film Reservoir Dogs, it became an international cult classic. Also in 1992, the song reached the number 1 position in Japan, after it was used in a Japanese whiskey commercial. 

This song is included in the soundtrack of Quentin Tarantino's film "Reservoir Dogs", and appears in the famous intro scene that leads into the opening credits.
