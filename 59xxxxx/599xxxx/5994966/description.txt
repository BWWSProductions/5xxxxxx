By request.
A terrible recording, from past-well-worn/damaged original record/vinyl.
Set your expectations low: it sounds like you\'re listening to a beat up
record on a child\'s record player.
Source recording, no post-processing.

Love the \"Unbreakable\" printed on their record lable.

Warning: Some songs may stay with your impressionable younguns, 
who are baffled by the occasional macabre lyrics. Blind Mice? 
Chopping off tails? Measles and weasels?
Just speaking from my own experience here...

Thanks for sharing & caring.
Cheers, FerraBit
