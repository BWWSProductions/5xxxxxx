I am a huge fan, I have collected the Doors for 20+ years and have all of these shows, however I want to let people know what a sweet collection this is, JugzGOnn4G3ty4 THANK YOU! I will keep seeding and hey has anyone seen the new    ISLE WIGHT footage? ITS AWESOME! I am wanting to trade for Cinematheque  Morrison and Kreiger Poetry for Norman benefit show in Holloywood 69 i think. Peace out twist a fat doobie and listen to the DOORS!  Anyone looking for something specific, I have a nice collection and always happy to share... THANK YOU!"
