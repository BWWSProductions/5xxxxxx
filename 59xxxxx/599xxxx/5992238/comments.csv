,ODBC,2011-01-16T10:49Z,Thank you for sharing.
,Dizzious,2011-01-16T17:36Z,"Thanks! The video quality of this is impeccable. I wish more people would use 900p, it's a great middle ground between 720 and 1080.

Could you upload the rest of season 3 in this same format? Pretty please? "

,Peter_1994,2011-01-31T21:27Z,"The other episodes are all non combo. Could you please do the other episodes too? Thank you so much in advance. And if it could be in 900p i would really be glad.

BTW for horror games fans: I recently downloaded amnesia: the dark descent. That game is AWESOME! Ok first part is a bit boring, but when you advance it becomes more scary every step! I can only play for half an hour then i am to tensed to play.

Hope my tip was useful.

Another BTW: Thanks for the uplode relian1!"
