This is a collection of various interesting ebooks I've found in thepiratebay.

I do not take credit for these; others have supplied them and shared with the rest of us (some are named users here on TPB, others who are forgotten as their contributions were removed for whatever reason) and I am grateful to these people.

The topic of these ebooks is generally society-related subjects, such as politics, sociology, philosophy, anarchism and so on.

Sharing these books is not an endorsement, but rather an expression of my interest in these subjects, something I wish to share with you all.

I intend to maintain and update this torrent in the future, when I find more books of interest or noteworthyness.
