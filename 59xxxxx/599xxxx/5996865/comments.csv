,gurbehud,2010-11-29T19:35Z,it have got a working online multyplayer??
,KEEVVY,2010-11-30T12:04Z,"No multiplayer, but for me this worked better than skidrow dvd9. May be SHIELD used only the crack from skidrow, and used theyre own dvd to make this. Tumbs up for SHIELD !"
,KEEVVY,2010-12-01T00:45Z,"Last mision same error, stuck at that guy holding the gun, tryed last resolution, antialising, shadow, vsinc and nothing, the guy just stays there with his gun pointed at me, I even restarted the level for a few times but same error. Some advices?"

,brandonpayne1213,2010-12-02T16:46Z,does this have zombies???
,KEEVVY,2010-12-02T23:56Z,"I actualy finish the game with this version, and when you get stuck at the last mision, restart the mision and press escape lots of times before the moment you get stuck. And yes it has zombies, 1level already unlock, and the second afther you finish the game."

,KEEVVY,2010-12-07T07:08Z,"For lower cpu, try this for Windows7: install from microsoft in this order: 
1. directx SDK jun 2010
2. directx redist feb 2010
3. directx redist aug 2009
if not already installed by windows updates install all soo this things: 
- Visual C++ 2005 SP1 Redistributable Package
- Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package
- Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package
be carefull on x86 and x64 PC's for evry vc++.
All soo install the nvidia physx, even if you have ati.
Know install shield version, let it install automatic the directx at the finish if need it.
Don't unmont dvd2, just click play from the menu that apears. Don't install update1 & don't copy the crack, try like this first. Play with default settings, and if the sound is good & it doesen't freez play like this even if the player is moving preaty hard untill mision 4, than downgrade your settings. If this doesen't work try update 1, 2&3 and the crack. If you have bitdefender turn it on gaming mod."

,TheBlakDog,2011-07-21T17:45Z,"Gentlemen, I am not here to complain, but I would like some detailed instructions if I may. I am a Noob and I'm not a dummy, but the readme file did not explain how to work the patch very clearly. Could you please find some time out of your day to give an explicit and detailed, step by step guide in the proper installation of the patch please? I have downloaded the game, burned the dvd, and installed the game. I have also downloaded the patch, I followed the directions to the best of my ability with no positive results, again without trying to be critical, the readme file is not very detailed. I have all the components but not enough directions, could you please help a Noob out? I do understand this is Single Player only. Thanks again. Best regards,
B. "
