,The Spook,2011-01-03T06:14Z,"There is a second apk for 800x400 in the Reso for 800x480 folder.

Works fine on HD2 with FroYo and Australian R17 maps."
,divji,2011-02-19T14:34Z,"you have to rename the main folder into ""iGO"" and put everything what it comes with the download in there! 

as sweix80 said, download astro file manager from market to run the .apk file. 

european maps are included. works perfectly on my htc gratia so far. thx a lot!"
