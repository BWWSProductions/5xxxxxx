Jumping a bit aside, this one is something different...
Rarity small-run exotic item, every collector's joy...
Japanese band and production, american style music...
Guitar, mandolin, fiddle, dobro, banjo, acoustic bass...
Sweet female vocals, english with soft japanese accent...

12 I Belong To That Music

Ripped direct from vinyl - relatively new condition but not just good pressing,
so there's some distortion and s-effect can be heard, also few cracks and pops,
although we succeeded to remove most of them manually using digital remastering
But the sound remained untouched, it's really very colorful, shiny and dynamic!

(melodic acoustic grassy softpop & true bluegrass from Japan)
