Checking PFI

Video partition found
     Video CRC = A06010A3 (V0 = A26E53B6, V1 = EAE76B94)

brand new wave if this is a new game and abgx360.dat hasn't been updated yet)

Stealth status is uncertain

,FucHollywood,2010-11-30T04:14Z,@abernick00 the reason its sayin that is cause the game hasnt been released yet so there is no verified rip.
,inki111,2010-12-08T19:15Z,"nuked rip, do not download, game crc is bad, no ppf patch yet. abgx fixes other problems with this release (autofix lvl3), but cant fix problem with game crc.

этот рип кривой, мудохался два дня, пытался исправить, но безрезультатно. не качайте.

качайте/download global.repack"
