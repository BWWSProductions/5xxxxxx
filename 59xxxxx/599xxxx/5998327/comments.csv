,naraku00,2010-12-01T23:27Z,"Those hosts entries can't possibly work especially a URL:

""127.0.0.1 http://internetdownloadmanager.com""

...I'm not going to uninstall and restart (as IDM requires one) for such half assed 'crack' just to see that I'm right. 

I advise not to download this. "
,s3nr1,2010-12-02T01:07Z,"^ like above, doesn't work. It detects the false serial and exits. IDM probably has a lot more host names to contact. This program needs some kind of patch. "
[T],SnowCrash05,2010-12-02T08:05Z,"No patch is needed am using this method for almost 6 months, it's working great.Please follow the instructions :)"
,TechWizard86,2010-12-03T20:04Z,I think this torrent needs an updated patch. This one on the hosts file only covers two sites. Find out all the others umbrella tears and then post them here. THEN it will work.
,TechWizard86,2010-12-03T20:05Z,"Correction on the above post, I meant to say host names, not sites."
