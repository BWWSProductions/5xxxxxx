,seedammit,2010-11-29T01:36Z,"Which one is the best flash card and where to buy it?

I'm sick of the old original R4

Which one just works all the time with almost everything?"
,mk2007123,2010-11-29T03:45Z,"DSTWO 

and wood 1.18 came out, fixed dark dawn :)"
,billabong411,2010-11-29T15:06Z,Doesnt Work on R4i Gold 1.4.1
,billabong411,2010-11-29T15:06Z,Doesnt Work on R4i Gold 2.0
,Jangles90,2010-11-29T19:22Z,Doesn't work on R4Ultra 1.56
,mrp73,2010-11-30T06:08Z,seedammit : I find your comments about being sick of the original R4 kind of funny as it is actually thanks to Wood probably THE most up to date card when it comes to compatibility on the market today.  Why would anyone be sick of a card that is so inexpensive and still ticking after several years on the market.  That to me is golden!
,Imok86,2010-11-30T18:37Z,for M3 real/M3i zero user it works with the newest YSM3 :)
,Herz_F,2010-12-01T04:52Z,"@Imok86 @ where did you get this firmware ?
I can`t find it :(
Can you share a link, plz ?"
,wikiri,2010-12-01T13:36Z,"I can play on DSTT. Exist fix for that. Great game, so beautifull and playable"
,dothackjhe,2010-12-01T15:43Z,Thanks! Works on No$gba 2.6a + no$zoomer! ^_________________^
,RussianKillerTeady,2010-12-01T19:11Z,"N0Zoomer v 0.9.6 kinda crappy with jumping screen and anoying buzzing sound when people talk, and outrageous lagg during battle. "
,RussianKillerTeady,2010-12-01T19:12Z,oops meant to say DeSuMe
,RussianKillerTeady,2010-12-01T19:23Z,N0$GBA 2.6a dont seem to work for me though :(
,juicean,2010-12-02T17:53Z,It works on R4 (Firmware v1.29b)
,Shurikiu,2010-12-02T19:00Z,Is this torrent clean?
,Imok86,2010-12-02T20:07Z,"@Herz_F: Well the site that hostet YSM3 is down right now but i uplaoded it 

ho()tfile.com/dl/86535451/9bbc499/YSM3.rar.html

,Zegapain,2010-12-05T07:24Z,Anyone know why after having the DSi closed for awhile as soon as I resume play the game freezes? Using Acekard 2i with AKAIO 1.8.1 (AP Bypass Enabled).
,sacumblousi,2010-12-06T01:39Z,"Works for me on DeSmume 0.9.6 but I needed to go to Sound Settings and check Advanced SPU Logic to fix the buzzing sound, but this reduced the sound quality a bit (way better than listening to that annoying buzz). I'm still gonna buy the game :)"
,danijel.james,2010-12-08T16:44Z,"Has anyone got this to work on M3iZero using the Quad-Boot method yet?

I have tried and I think it's actually mine is GMP z003 model and that means it won't work.

If anyone can update or followup on this?  I'm trolling around on GBAtemp looking for a solution.

You can try by having a look at this:  http://gbatemp.net/t267413-getting-golden-sun-working-on-m3-how-to"
,Katffs,2010-12-19T16:09Z,"@Imok86

I tried that fix you posted, copied the TTMenu and the YSMenu folder on the root of my SD and copied YSM3.NDS into my game folder and ran it, but I got an error saying ""Error: Can't fatinitdefault""

,Herz_F,2010-12-20T04:20Z,Seems to work fine on M3 DS Real with new firmware (v4.9_M73)

,TwisTtheTwiTcH,2011-02-21T03:07Z,"I can't seem to update the description. It works on M3i Zero with the latest update. Just check your respected flash cards firmware for recent updates. You can also try searching ""Golden Sun Dark Dawn on *Name of Flash Card*"" to get this backup working on your flash card.

,amuletofra,2011-02-22T06:54Z,"CyClo DS Evo updated and runs this fine.
I was playing this on it earlier"
,TwisTtheTwiTcH,2011-03-28T08:22Z,"I'd update the description but TPB isn't letting me. If you are having issues with your flashcard & this backup. Google and find the newest firmware for your card. It is likely to be compatible now. Just post here if you need help.

Besides if you're going to do something, might as well do it well and not get caught. Best of luck
