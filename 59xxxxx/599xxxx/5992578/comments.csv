,berly22,2010-11-29T23:06Z,Beware... after downloading my windows explorer crashed every time i opened the containing folder. I had to delete the torrent + data from uTorrent in order to stop it from crashing.
,msmmpts,2010-11-30T02:51Z,This is a fine torrent.
,yopepoy,2010-11-30T10:09Z,"@berly22
get the fuck out of here!! you don't deserve to get this one."
,berly22,2010-11-30T16:10Z,"@yopepoy

I am just stating what happened... i have downloaded hundreds of torrents and never had that problem where my windows explorer crashed every time i opened the containing folder! I have also downloaded several since the file was deleted with no problems.

I am glad the file worked fine for you... unfortunately, I did not have the same luck."
