This yearâ€™s sixteen X Factor finalists have recorded a cover of David Bowieâ€™s abiding classic "Heroes," originally a hit in 1977. The single, in aid of â€˜Help For Heroesâ€™ is the third charity release from X Factor, following last yearâ€™s cover of Michael Jackonsâ€™s "You Are Not Alone," which supported Great Ormond Street Childrenâ€™s Hospital and 2008â€™s "Hero" which raised over Â£1.3 million for the â€˜Help For Heroesâ€™ charity.
â€˜Help For Heroesâ€™ was set up in 2007, by Bryn and Emma Parry and a group of friends and relations, many of who had connections with serving servicemen and women. Bryn and his wife Emma wanted to do something to help those wounded in battle and â€˜Help For Heroesâ€™ was born.
The sixteen acts performing on the single are: the boys Aiden Grimshaw, Matt Cardle, Paije Richardson and Nicolo Festa; the girls Cher Lloyd, Rebecca Ferguson, Treyc Cohen and Katie Weissel; the over 28s Wagner Carrilho, John Adeleye, Storm Lee and Mary Byrne; and the groups Diva Fever, One Direction, Belle Amie and FYD.
