,AdamHuge1,2011-05-26T04:02Z,Can anyone help me to activate the English subtitles? I can't figure it out. Thanks in advance.
,otakcat,2011-06-15T13:27Z,can someone please please instruct how to get english subtitles working? I'm writing an essay on this and need to know asap. couldn't find info on net anywhere. thanks!!
,AdamHuge1,2011-06-16T16:21Z,"@otakcat: I can't figure it out either, but in the Subtitles folder, after the preliminary stuff, all the translations are included. Not ideal, but you could print off a copy and have that beside you as you watch the movie."
[T],-Gabe-,2011-06-28T11:02Z,"Thanks!! Great restored film.
By the way, only the purple color was missing from these posts :)"
,eigakan89,2011-07-15T08:45Z,"@otakcat and AdamHuge1 , you can get the subtitles working by making sure both the .srt and .MP4 file are in exactly the same folder, and RENAMING both of the files so they have exactly the same name at the front. 

Example:

ABC.MP4 and ABC.srt

I watched this with my dad about a year ago. I enjoyed it thoroughly but I'm not going to watch it again. I'll just download it for posterity.

Thanks for the upload."
