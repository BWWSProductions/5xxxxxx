Long story to this one...

Years ago a good friend and fellow jazz enthusiast brought me a cassette that he had the foresight to record off the radio of a broadcast of a Chick Corea and Gary Burton concert at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Memorial Hall from 1979.  The only thing more amazing than the fact that the cassette even survived the 20-or-so years before it came into my possession is the remarkable quality of the recording.  I made a digital copy some years ago, but my limited technology and even more limited proficiency with said technology didn't allow me to do a decent transfer.  I got better software and more experience with it and have made what I believe to be a rather nice transfer of a fantastic performance.  It's a shame that more people haven;t heard this so it's my hope to share this with as many people as possible so that it will never be lost.  

I included the song intros as separate tracks to both preserve the entirety of the recording and allow each song to be listened to separately without a long into at the the beginning or end.  

The tracklisting is as follows:

Disk One

1.  Gary Burton solo
2.  intro
3.  Chick Corea solo
4.  intro
5.  Crystal Silence
