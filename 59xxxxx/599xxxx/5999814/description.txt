Gabriel Garcia Marques' story filmed by Ruy Guerra (Opera Malandro, Aguirre). The original story was part of 100 Years of Solitude, here it is presented independently. The misfortunes of the young lady seem to be a metaphor for South America, crushed by foreign debt. The art-direction is first-rate, and there are many mythological allusions.
