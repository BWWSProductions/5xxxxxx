,texasdragonman,2010-12-03T03:31Z,"unwatchable.... sound is indeed understandable, however, the video is literally unwatchable... color is all over the place, the dark sceans are so dark as to be able to see nothing, and the ENTIRE movie is out of focus making for a blurry picture all the way through

,moviewhore05,2010-12-05T06:08Z,@epic420 I am going to say no on the player question because of the colored skull next to the uploaders name. Also the 4 comments before your should have been a good indication there were not any issues.
