Plot
The final is now just two weeks away, and as the dream of a recording contract and a chart-topping music career comes within reach for the contestants, Matt, Cher, Rebecca, Katie, One Direction, Mary and Wagner will now be pulling out all the stops to give their best performances so far - singing two songs each from the world of rock. Dermot O'Leary is on hand to deal with the triumphs and tears as Simon Cowell, Cheryl Cole, Dannii Minogue and Louis Walsh defend their own acts.
