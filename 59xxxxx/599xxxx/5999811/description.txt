SUMMARY: Soar into the skies on a thrilling airbourne adventure in this meticulously restored Film Classic. In one 

of his most memorable roles, John Wayne plays Dan Roman, a vetran pilot haunted by a tragic past. Now relegated to 

second-in-command cockpit assignments, he finds himself scheduled on a routine Honolulu-to San Francisco flight - 

one that takes a terrifying, suspense building turn when disaster strikes high above the Pacific Ocean at the 

point of no return.
