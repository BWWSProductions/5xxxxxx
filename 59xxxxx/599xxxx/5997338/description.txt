Laying waste to all the wink-wink irony, dubious material, and vocal 

mediocrity that frequently mires alt-country fringe dwellers, the second outing 

from this Virginia-born belter marries tough, twangy rock with wild, 

unguarded emotion. Neko's principal charm may be her voice--sometimes 

coming on with Dusty Springfield's indigo-eyed soul (the dreamlike 

"Porchlight"), Patsy Cline's aching slow burn (the slinky "No Need to Cry"), 

and Wanda Jackson's imperious sexuality (the rockabilly "Mood to Burn 

Bridges")--but her songwriting (she cowrote every tune) is surprisingly 

consistent and memorable. She celebrates the "passion for life" found in her 

abandoned home of Tacoma, Washington, or a strapped-on Telecaster, and 

on her best song, "Guided by Wire," she balances between "darkest 

recollection" and the freedom of music, the kind that matters most, all those 

voices "singing my life back to me."
