The Straight Story (1999)

Director: David Lynch

Cult indie filmmaker David Lynch's 1999 Golden Palm nominated feature is the offbeat tale of a man trying to make peace with his past. Richard Farnsworth (in his last cinematic role) plays Alvin Straight, who embarks on a journey across America with the intention of repairing his relationship with his estranged, and terminally ill brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton). It is a ponderous undertaking given that Alvin's transport is his tractor, and those expecting Lynchâ€™s more traditional brand of creepy hi-jinks will be surprised at the gentle tale that unfolds. Filmed in sequence, the director intended the work to be seen as a single whole experience, to such an extent that the DVD release contained no scene selection or extra options. As such the film concentrates principally upon the physical and emotional journey of Farnsworth's character, as he passes advice to those he meets on his way drawn from his own considerable life experience. The actual event that gave cause to the separation between Alvin and Lyle is never clearly defined, yet this accentuates rather than undermines the drama of Alvin's plight.

Lynch maintains the simplicity of this tale and allows Farnsworth's layered performance to carry the film. With able support from Sissy Spacek and Stanton, this gentle epic is imbued with a warmth that you would not normally attribute to the director of Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway and Blue Velvet. Nevertheless Lynch does manner to eschew normal convention in certain respects, by producing a "Based on True Events" story that not only fails to irritate on any level, but manages to be heart-warming without resorting to crass, sensationalist melodrama. The result is an unassuming, plain-spoken ode to the value of family unity, embodied by the character of Alvin Straight himself. 

The Straight Story was independently shot along the actual route taken by Alvin Straight, and all scenes were shot in chronological order.

Unlike his prior films (or any that would follow), The Straight Story was distributed by Walt Disney Pictures after a successful debut at Cannes, was given a G rating by the MPAA, and is the only Lynch film that Lynch himself did not have a hand in the screenplay (although it was co-written by his recurring associate, Mary Sweeney). There are no chapter markers on one of the DVD releases, as Lynch wanted the film to be watched as a whole.

Richard Farnsworth was terminally ill with bone cancer during the shooting of the film, which had caused the paralysis of his legs as shown in the film. He actually took the role out of admiration for Alvin Straight, and astonished his co-workers with his tenacity during production. Because of the pain of his disease, Farnsworth committed suicide the following year, at the age of 80.

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
