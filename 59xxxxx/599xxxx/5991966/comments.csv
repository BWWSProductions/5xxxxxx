,SMEEEEEEEEEEE,2010-12-01T00:31Z,@huangshanhome - You are the epitome of a leech... this is fdiazr's first torrent and he/she is clearly having connection issues (second time trying to upload it). fdiazr is doing you a favor and you tell him/her to go die...

,Yamcha67,2010-12-01T20:37Z,"I have given up seeding, I'm just going to delete the game, thanks for upload attempt, but its been I think about a week if not longer and the progress is very slow. Its now also available for download with file sharing links on warez forums.. And I've seen people say it doesn't work very well, its extremely slow hardly playable.."
,huangshanhome,2010-12-01T21:50Z,im not trying to be mean here. can he seed just a little bit more or what? looks like a school project trying to monitor web traffic or something and care less about people who tried to download. this torrent just failed big time.
,fdiazr,2010-12-01T22:56Z,"Today was a bad day, just when i goes to my job my wife or childrens shutdown the server. Sorry :(

The good news is i start seeding again. 

About the game performance, i can say sometimes the game go slow, but it's playable,  i play it everyday.

,wangmanthewang,2010-12-03T00:42Z,ok i found stuffit on thepiratebay but it requires a serial number... wtf is this shit
,fdiazr,2010-12-03T00:54Z,"For those people who donâ€™t know how to use it, and some help and directions:

1. The file is compressed in .rar format; it is similar to a .zip format, itÂ´s a compressed file that contains the .app application. You need a program to uncompress it and extract the .app files. You can use stuffit, The Unarchiver, 7-Zip, or whatever program you want. Search the net and download it.

2. It is a lie the file is password protect

3. The File is ok and it is not corrupted, some people used it and work fine. If you try to open it before the download finish you will receive and error, of course. If you get and error, look for another fails.

4. Some people it`s saying the program is virus infected, it is a fallacy. Virus it is not an issue on mac osx. 

Read from begin of the comments, are people that only says negative words, are idiots. For those people: I only say, like the sound: â€œWhy you donÂ´t get a job?â€

5. The game only works on Intel platforms, not run on power pc. It is a port from Windows Platform.

6. I only have probed it with NVidia graphics cards, but not ATI. But, somebody said on comments itÂ´s works on ATI too. Thatâ€™s great.

If you need some assistance, I can help you.

You are Welcome"

YES.
The only reason these guys can't get it to work is because they're being idiots and don't know how to use StuffIt.
I'm playing this with zero lag on a MacBook and it doesn't quit on me so I'm guessing that you'll be fine as well"
