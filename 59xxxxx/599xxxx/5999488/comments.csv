,krizz91,2010-12-02T13:06Z,"@skeelz: How can you ask a stupid question and than add: thats my oponion, when it clearly is HIS oponion he wrote?"
,krizz91,2010-12-02T13:18Z,"@Skeelz: Why do you ask a stupid question and then add: Thats my opinion, when he clearly sais HIS own opinion?!"
,aradiel,2010-12-02T15:12Z,"@haydn

God uses the stairs for the cardio. Save the environment, that kind of thing."
,krizz91,2010-12-02T21:13Z,"@Skeelz: I couldn't see my first comment so I tried to post it again, thats why there is two comments that are pretty much the same. 

And I am not mad, I have no reason to be. I just think its strange that you say that he has a strange opinion when you know everybody has their own opinion. "

V: 6
M: 6

I didn't like the whole thing with god and devil-BS, but thought that it was an entertaining movie. I think the lighting and the halfbad sound took away the scary parts of this movie, but the psychological is still there."

,seanieboy78,2010-12-06T22:06Z,what is with those two arseholes giving away the story? cant you kick those pair of dna diluting punks off pbt? i guess not. people like them should be forceably sterilised. i was thinking of dl this film seeing what peeps had to say then had two read that shite. pair of pricks.
,seanieboy78,2010-12-08T17:40Z,how in gods name could i have uploaded double the amount of data than i have downloaded? bit of a pain in the rectum.lol. its taking ages i have a dongle so it normally takes overnight when i have no restrictions but this one has taken 2 days and still isnt finished. any hints or tips for a relative newbie? i know the ending as well because of are two friends. hope its good or i'll be looking for a refund.lol
