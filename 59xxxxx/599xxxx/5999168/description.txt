India's recent economic performance has been attracting world attention, but the phenomenon needs to be appreciated in the larger context of its long history. After a thousand years of decline, India is re-awakening not just as an economy, but as a civilization. The country now has a genuine opportunity to re-establish itself as a major global power. Since the beginning of its journey of economic progress in the 19th century, India has been passing through difficult phases.From times when there seemed to be no road ahead during the decades of socialism, to the pain of restructuring in the 1990s, India has seen it all. Economic and social forces such as demographic shifts and rising literacy levels are promising India's transformation beyond recognition. A significant change has been in terms of broader thinking and attitude towards innovation and risk. This book showcases India's journey towards the present historic juncture, its challenges ahead and its prospects for a better tomorrow, from the perspective of the new generation of Indians.
