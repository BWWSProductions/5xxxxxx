,biodog77,2010-12-10T23:44Z,"be careful this torrent was tracked some on to my pc , by verizon ?? Got a letter telling me to erase it and the software I used to download it ? "
,timjin,2010-12-14T08:53Z,"@biodog77 

Who do you use as a ISP? Some ISPs know what your doing, can and will report you. most send you a warning saying something to the effect of, we will report you to the MPAA or  if you dont do X. A friend of mine had this happen last year, he never used torrent from his house again, so i dont know if they really would of sent his info to the MPAA or who ever. 

I doubt this helps seeing as you are ether on a ISP that watches for p2p and or have already been found but... Make sure your client is encrypting, also use software like PeerBlock. But the best thing to do is to find a new ISP if you can. If you cant then the only 2 things you can do is, stop P2P or find a new place to do it.  

PS: if they get serious about it find something to blame it on. WoW uses p2p to update (last i checked) and or go buy a wireless router and blame the neighbors."
,susie_q809,2010-12-14T22:54Z,"hmm, there must be something wrong with mine.

,lvytn,2011-03-13T21:58Z,"this is tracked, youll receive complaint"
,WICKEDSTRAWBERRY,2011-03-14T02:53Z,"For those complaining about quality....if you don't like the quality then wait for it to hit the stores and go buy it. I have downloaded quite a few of .BONE.'s torrents and have never had a problem with any of them. I am an impatient person and appreciate the free previews I get by downloading them, as it would cost me a fortune to go to the theaters to go see every movie I want to see. Thanks for the movies .BONE. ! THUMBS UP!"
,WICKEDSTRAWBERRY,2011-03-14T02:56Z,"Oh, and for those who post that they got an e-mail warning for downloading.....BULLSHIT. I have been downloading constantly for a couple of years and have not received one single warning. If your ISP was really gonna cut your internet off, they wouldn't inform you in an e-mail where you might never see it. Most people get tons of junk in their e-mail and don't read everything that comes in."

,Bargetti,2011-03-15T12:58Z,"Quality was acceptable but not going to rate it any higher but I will show my respect and say thank you for uploading because I at least got to see it and thats what counts for me.

Video:5
Audio:4

Movie itself is way better than the previous ones since its a little less immature. good movie though and I would recommend it.
