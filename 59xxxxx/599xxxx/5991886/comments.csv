This is a f*ing retarded Uwe Boll movie, you're wasting your time if you watch this!"

,954blade,2010-12-05T19:03Z,Thanks dj.
,pistaker,2010-12-09T03:40Z,"@incurro is right ... Statham AND Ron Perlman (Hell Boy, City of Lost Children etc.).  Worth a shot.  Ron Perlman is a much under-appreciated talent."
,pistaker,2010-12-09T03:44Z,"And its got Ray Liotta and Burt Reynolds!!  Trifecta, Baby!  Revel in the campiness!  And its even got Shaggy(from Scooby Doo - aka Matthew Lillard)!!  How can you go wrong?!?"
