           In 1969 the Apollo moon landing is to be televised             
           internationally but at a country fair in England a small       
           boy named Jim meets the 90-year-old Julius Bedford who         
           tells him that,in 1909,as a struggling writer,he met           
           eccentric Professor Cavor,inventor of Cavorite,a               
           gravity-defying substance which they used to build a           
           sphere,which took them to the Moon. Captured by ant-like       
           Selenites,Bedford was anxious to make his escape but           
           Cavor was happy to stay and communicate with the               
           Moon-dwellers. Back on Earth Bedford hears via wireless        
           that Cavor was forced to kill himself and the                  
           Moon-dwellers to prevent them from invading Earth. As Jim      
           watches the Apollo landing with his parents back in the        
           present he sees a Selenite,hiding behind a lunar               
           rock,peering at the astronauts.
