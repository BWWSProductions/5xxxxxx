I recently got it for my kid and figured shared cuz its getting harder and harder to find stuff like this still intact and not broken up into a bunch of dead youtube links. Didn't see anyone else seeding this retro dealy so I figured i would. I also found a line to Dot and the Whale as well and if i can obtain it I will.

PS - Anyone have the original Ramona TV Show they used to broadcast on PBS? They ran it up here in Canada in the 80's and the only torrent of it is dead.
