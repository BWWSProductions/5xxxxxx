All i did was increase the resolution and combined them, nothing more. Just seemed like a cool share cuz its from Australia yet in Canada i seen it as a kid. And this was back in the really early eighties when vcrs and betas weren't even around in my area. I seen it on one of those old vinyl laser disc machines that had a plastic sleeve that took the record inside. I mightve been like 4-5 when i seen this."
