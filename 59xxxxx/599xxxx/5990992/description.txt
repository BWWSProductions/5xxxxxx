Operation Condor (1991)

Agent Jackie is hired to find WWII Nazi gold hidden in the Sahara desert. He teams up with three bundling women (the 3 stooges?) who are all connected in some way. However a team of mercenries have ideas on the ownership of the gold. A battle / chase ensues as to who gets there first. Lots of choregraphed Kung-Fu and quirky Chan humour.
