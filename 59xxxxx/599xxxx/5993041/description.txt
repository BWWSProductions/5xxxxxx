In my mind, THIS is the definative U2 Box Set.
I am a collector, and of course, love listening to my collection.
I began digitizing this for my own personal use.  Many of these rips are my own, 
but some came from various sources because they sounded better than mine because 
my vinyl or CD had scratches that prevented accurate reproduction. On the vinyl
rips, I left the clicks and pops in.  I have never been happy with click removal 
software.  

This is by far the most complete collection available.  It has cuts like "The Electric Co." with the "Send in the Clowns" snippet that was removed in many releases of UABRS.  The Australian Version of "The Unforgettable Fire" Single with an alternate mix of "A Sort Of Homecoming" and "Love Comes Tumbling" with alternate vocals.The fan club releases are all here. Where I have the promo releases, I included those as well.Songs that appear on various collections and soundtracks are also included. If you check the singles against what is listed on U2Wanderer.org, you will find that they are all here (except the non-album singles, some of those are missing). Everything is tagged, with the proper artwork.   If you like the music, please buy it.  This is my first torrent ever. I hope you enjoy it.  A FLAC release is on the way.
