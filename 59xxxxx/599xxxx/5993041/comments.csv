Just some questions ->

1) Is the MP3 version the same collection of songs as the FLAC collection?
2) Did these MP3's come from the FLAC collection? And did you convert them yourself?
3) Which FLAC to MP3 encoder did you use and what setting did you use?
4) Why are some MP3's at strange bitrates, like 281 kbps or 306 kpbs?

THANKS FOR AN AMAZING POST!!!

P.S. FYI for those who want to know -> 99.9% of the MP3's are LAME CBR 256 kbps or better."
