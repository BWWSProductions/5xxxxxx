After installation, when I connect to Internet, Acrobat says invalid key."

,jaymsd,2011-01-02T18:20Z,i'm having the same problem with serials once connected to the internet after installing. have even tried leaving the internet off for the first few uses and reboots but its still flashing up as invalid as soon as i turn it back on.
,ocdboy777,2011-02-11T15:21Z,"Anyone have any idea as to why this one is 3.24 GiB, thethingy's is 2.67 GiB and the trial from adobe.com is 2.13 GiB? Is this one from a original disc image? Has anything been added or removed? "
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-02-17T00:51Z,"If the keys don't work i would recomend you guys to restart and run the activation blocker again.... 

If then not i donno ""/ 


About the size someone commented, I donno i just downloaded the setup from Adobe.com :) "
,FitnessGirl24,2011-02-24T07:15Z,"@Cyber. Installs well, PS works really well.
But once connected to net, I get prompted for a serial everytime I need Adobe PDF.

Once I use another in the list, its fine until the next time I launch. Alternative is to disconnect from internet..

If a fix comes along, pls let us know."

You may need to do this:

1. Launch Acrobat x.
2. Go to Edit / Preferences../ Updater...
3. Select ""Do not download or install updates automatically""

Hope this would help."
,qinyanshanren,2011-02-25T00:23Z,"Add to my last comment:

For other applications (Like Photoshop):
1.	Disconnect internet temporary for this action.
2.	HELP / Update âŚ/ Preferences: uncheck all items."
,FitnessGirl24,2011-02-25T01:35Z,"@qinyanshanren - Jesus, I think you might have got it.
I've fixed both Adobe and PS, launched both a couple times with the net back on and not been prompted.
Tyvm!!
