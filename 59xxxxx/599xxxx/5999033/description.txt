Clare Bowditch (born 1975) is an Australian musician from Melbourne, Victoria. She released her fourth album Modern Day Addiction via Island Records on 13 August 2010. It became both 3RRR Album of the Week and ABC Radio National's Album of the Week. MDA is the first of Bowditch's album's to enter the Top Ten. Bowditch recently supported Leonard Cohen on his 2010 Australian tour.

She is best known as a heart-felt songwriter, for her satirical on-stage antics, and for the Open Letters section on her website in which she chronicled her early career as it happened. Most recently, she has been approached to take on several roles as a "social commentator": she wrote an article for ABC's The Drum entitled "Mr Jones and Me", and also made her debut on the ABC's Q&A as the first panelist to also perform a song ("Bigger Than the Money"). In August 2010, she spent an hour interviewing PM Julia Gillard for MySpace Today.
