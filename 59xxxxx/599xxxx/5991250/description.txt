Not Russian classical opera of the 19th century but, on the contrary, a Western 20th century avant-garde work (already however a classic) in a Bolshoi Theatre production is to be transmitted live by Mezzo, the popular French TV channel devoted to classical music, opera, ballet, jazz and world music. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Listen, Look, DareÃ¢â‚¬Â is MezzoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s  slogan.  And in producing Alan BergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opera Wozzeck, the Bolshoi has  demonstrated that this is an attitude  it fully supports. The live broadcast of  this opera (conductor Teodor Currentzis, director Dmitri Tcherniakov) from the Bolshoi will  be on 26 November 2010, at 5 p.m. Paris time.
