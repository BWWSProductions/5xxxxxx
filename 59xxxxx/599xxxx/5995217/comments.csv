,TheBleed,2010-11-29T22:48Z,You are a god! I didn't think season 2 was out on DVD already with english subs since the first season just came out through funimation not even 2 weeks ago.
,TheBleed,2010-12-01T21:51Z,Guys can we get some seeds please? This is the best file for this anime and we should treat it as such. Once I finish (stuck at 58%) then I'll seed my ass off.
,bobafett169,2010-12-02T14:23Z,Maybe Hipertex died.  I'm at 58% too.
,TheBleed,2010-12-03T23:26Z,Maybe he was just full of shit since sekirei pure engagement dosn't even have an uncensored version yet out? I dunno...but a quick filestube.com search seems to affirm this assumption.
,mockingdevil78,2010-12-06T23:35Z,Awesome but we need seeds. I'm at 5.5 gb. Will seed afterwards.
,anima273,2010-12-12T09:57Z,no seed :-( anyone?
,TheBleed,2010-12-13T17:54Z,"After 2 weeks still no seed. I started the day the torrent went up and still no sign of the original seeder, Hipertex. Wtf..."
,rawrrrz,2010-12-16T03:14Z,"No seeders.. BUT! I took it upon myself to find the original torrents, 100% of the 1st season is up now, and the second season will be done in a few hours. So, I'll be seeding it here shortly and hopefully keep this torrent alive. :D"
,rawrrrz,2010-12-17T06:36Z,"Disregard my lost post, even though they're the exact same files and sizes, it's saying it's only at 99% and won't count me as a seeder. The torrents are a relatively easy find though, just google the fansub groups, or look on nyaa. Season 2 is unfortunately censored, anyways."
,TheBleed,2010-12-18T17:01Z,"Yeah rawrrrz, that's why everyone is wanting this torrent. It has season 2 uncensored. You can find season 1 uncensored anywhere. But season 2 uncensored is very, very rare. 

That's why so many people is sticking to this torrent in the hopes of someone coming along and seeding...I'm now stuck at %60 so there was atleast some progress made within the last 2 weeks."
,Netao87,2010-12-30T14:44Z,"Seed seed, make use of my 100 mbps ^^, 2 hours left."
,TheBleed,2010-12-31T04:21Z,"Woah, where did the 12 seeders come from?!"
,TheBleed,2010-12-31T14:51Z,"Well damn, I guess people were fed up with this torrent and started seeding the censored season 2 blu ray version instead. :(

 Does a uncensored pure engagement even exist?"
,Akiro544,2011-01-21T15:20Z,PLZ SEED!!!!
,Akiro544,2011-01-22T11:13Z,PLZ SEED!
,TheBleed,2011-02-13T22:21Z,I am seeding. Is there a season 3 out yet?
,FrederichFrog,2011-03-22T06:41Z,"Season 3 isn't even produced yet, let alone aired, according to Wiki:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekirei"
,EmperorB,2011-03-22T16:12Z,need some seedZ
,DrPwn,2011-03-27T08:11Z,Pleeeeaaaaase Seeeeed!
,krdt27,2011-03-28T08:24Z,This is censored but still good enough for now.  I shall seed!
,mishagam,2012-03-10T16:45Z,"magnet link refused to work with lates mTorrent, list of files empty"
