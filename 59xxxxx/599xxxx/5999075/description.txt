Storyline: Acclaimed director Stephen Frears (Mrs. Henderson Presents, Dirty Pretty Things, Dangerous Liaisons, The Grifters) pulls back the curtain on the private chambers of the royal family in the aftermath of Princess Diana's death in 1997, where the contained, traditional world of the Queen of England (Helen Mirren) is brought into conflict with the public, modern Prime Minister (Michael Sheen) and a nation looking to its leaders for guidance in dark times. Dramatic and revealing, the story of The Queen was drawn from extensive interviews, research, discreet sources and informed imagination.
