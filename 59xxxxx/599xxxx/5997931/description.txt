"Smoked"

The terminally ill owner of a successful 
chain of restaurants (guest star Amos) 
hires Lightman to fulfill his dying wish: 
track down his daughter's killer. In the 
process, Lightman uncovers the twisted 
dynamic of the fractured family empire, 
leading him to suspect sibling rivalry as 
the motive and that the patriarch's sons 
might be somehow responsible for the 
death of their sister, who was first in 
line to run the family business.

Enjoy :)
