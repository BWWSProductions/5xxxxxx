There is minor overlap at the joins, the sound is about 400 msec ahead of the picture (this can be fixed using Avidemux without recoding), and the 16:9 picture displays as 4:3 (this can be fixed with MPEG4 Modifier without recoding)."

,Pharos01,2011-12-17T21:16Z,Use MKVMerge GUI ; set picture to 16/9 and audio negative delay -400ms
