I myself use Insignia Mp3/Mp4 player, drag and drop, no software needed, no fiery hoops to jump through, and no proof of purchase required. :-) I also have some Studios that work well, but this DL is designed for those other guys. As for winamp, I had mixed results with it and more control with goldwave. If Winamp meets your needs, cool."
