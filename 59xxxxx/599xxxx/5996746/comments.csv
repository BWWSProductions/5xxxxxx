,ddawg,2010-11-29T16:37Z,Alright! Thanks once again for sharing the Christmas spirit.
,butte56,2010-11-29T19:08Z,This torrent has at least one trojan attached to it. White Christmas is infected. Do not download.
,ddawg,2010-11-29T22:13Z,"Bullshit! Why is it always someone whom has never shared a damn thing and just discovered torrents yesterday always the one who screams trojan?  The only files in this torrent are TEXT, FLAC and coverart (.jpg's) get a clue and make sure your crapware isn't at fault.  Then tell us exactly which file and/or trojan your crapware is identifying. There's ABSOLUTELY no trojan/virus in this torrent."

If you wanna try a Beta of a free tool called zAudioConverter, that does this. I cannot post links here but info can be found on our Digital Software forum."
,z0neR81,2011-07-03T15:43Z,"FAKE !!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!! ITS ALL MP3 BULLSHIT CONVERTED TO ""FLAC"" AS A FAKE!!! Try Audiochecker (great app to dectect false music). Bye"
