This is the book, How Green were the Nazis. It is quite interesting. I can recommend a whole host of books on this. The nazis were 100% green and 100% insane. The greenie mentality, as this book and others illustrate is the reason for the hatred of Jews and Christians as expressed by the greenie ideology even today. The point there is that the greens do not believe man has the right to intervene on "nature" and that man is not part of "nature". For a more scientific explanation, read this book. It is good. Feel free to leave comments too. Maybe I will add more books on the subject and links to them.

Also, another great book on the subject, The Hitler Book, is available for free online. The link is:
