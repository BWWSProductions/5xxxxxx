Jonathan Switcher (McCarthy) is a struggling artist in Philadelphia who goes from one dead-end job to another. This all changes when he sees a mannequin (Cattrall) that he had created before at one of his jobs now displayed in an upscale department store.

After a situation where he saves the life of the store's owner, Clair Prince Timpkin (Estelle Getty), Jonathan is hired to work at the store as a stock clerk. He also befriends a flamboyantly gay co-worker named Hollywood Montrose (Taylor) while still managing a girlfriend, Roxie Shield (Carole Davis). While having to dodge the store's autocratic vice president (Spader) (who is also working with Illustra, a competing department store), and his dimwitted security guard (Bailey), the mannequin comes to life. The mannequin, "Emmy", was actually once Emahasure, a real-life woman from ancient Egypt. Her beauty, love and imagination inspire Switcher, with Emmy's help, to move from stock work to quickly becoming the best window dresser in town. Emmy and Jonathan have to fight through a lot, including the fact that she is alive only when just Jonathan can see her, which makes their relationship difficult.

However, everything starts to change when Illustra gets fewer and fewer customers because of the popularity of Jonathan's display windows. They first try to persuade him, through Roxie, to work there; when that does not work, the vice president and security guard decide that they must steal the mannequin from the store. They end up having to steal all the mannequins, since they could not identify Emmy from the others. When Jonathan finds out she is gone, he must fight through security guards and machines to save her. When he finally saves her, they both find out that because of their true love anything is possible, including a real live Emmy and a happy ever after
