,cojon,2011-08-13T04:32Z,"Promodsharma,

I didn't know about the Photoshop folder. I'll have to check that out. Organizing all the plugin's brushes, etc that one might use can be a job.   Thanks!  Appreciated! 

We can work with Photoshop for years and still find something new to learn. 

Also, thethingy good show! You NEVER need to take shit!  When someone else can get er done as well as you, THEN they can bitch!  Otherwise, they outta shut their trap and learn. "
