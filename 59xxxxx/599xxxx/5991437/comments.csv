Failure ^"
,Apneatic,2010-11-28T04:02Z,I finished downloading this and it didn't direct me to another site to download anything...seems to be ok so far. Pretty decent audio/video past the 36 minute mark. Will post back when I'm done going thru this.

It appears there are no seeders..."
,Apneatic,2010-11-28T05:07Z,At 43 minutes and so far so good. Some of the darker scenes are still tough to watch because it's hard to make out the details but not all of the dark scenes are like this. Audio is very clear.
,KimSaysHi,2010-11-28T07:52Z,Best quality yet. A9 / V9. DEFINITELY worth downloading. 
,Apneatic,2010-11-28T10:19Z,"I'd say A9/V9 when considering it's a cam...audio is the best I've heard of all the copies I've tried thus far. Video is great except for the especially dark scenes, but not bad considering what you have to work with as a cam copy. Definitely watchable. Thank you for your hard work. "
,jessemcfan,2010-11-28T16:33Z,"Left it over night and finally got it :).
Probably the best copy of this I've seen so far. Audio is really clear, the dark scenes are....dark lol, but you can still make out what's happening.
A9 V8"
