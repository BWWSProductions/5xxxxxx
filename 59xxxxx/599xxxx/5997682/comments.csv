,SammoSammy,2011-07-13T07:34Z,"NBC are faggots. I understand why full episodes aren't available to people outside of the US, but to have Webisodes unavailable to people outside of the US. Without this torrent, I would probably never get to see these. Fucking NBC. "

,bill.lupton,2012-04-08T11:34Z,"NBC sucks. While I thank you oobe54, for taking the time to rip these from the internet.  The audio and video does not sync up at all, for any of these files.  And when I tried to cut em apart and fix em, I cant because the audio speeds up and slows down depending on his internet connection when he ripped em.  This is not oobe54's fault, this is all we can get, when i tried to capture them from the net i got the same result.  VIDEO and AUDIO will NEVER match with a captured FLV format video."
