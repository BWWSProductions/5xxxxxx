[V],globeplus,2010-11-28T19:57Z,"To resi10 :  thank you for your question and beside is nothing missing , i needed to do an adaptation work with everything perfect for the intro videos , this videos have an exterior autorun that let the users watch anytime they want any of the intro videos , no problems inside the gameplay for that and this was tested , it is safe this procedure and the users get immediate access to any of this videos anytime they want , the game had close 13.5 gb on the game folder and almost nothing beside the compression it is possible to work , so i got the videos playing but no encoder for this type of videos , so the solution was an exterior autorun with all the intro videos in a nice quick way accessible anytime , reference too , to the fact that all the rest of the videos and the gameplay are absolutly normal inside the game , really just this work around for this intro videos and the game folder still have 12 gb exactly on the size after the extraction work .

HAPPY GAMING !!!

quick note : close 12 hours of work in total for this game ."

,royhere,2010-11-29T10:57Z,"to,
streetthug

virtua tennis 2009 is most sick game by sega.

vertua tennis 3 is better than this game..

 i am play the game thats why i can tell you..

and choice is yours,,"
[V],globeplus,2010-11-29T14:39Z,"To aasif.k30 : i understand that and enjoy your game and only the mention of that already shows appreciation for my work and you welcome to get my files wherever you want .

Ton gokuxela : i will not work the harry potter but hot pursuit already available with a fantastic work .

To streethug : is normal here and the users request some not so recent games but it is also true that i need to be concentrated in my not so much time on the new nice ones and i think that is understandable .

To igbababuyo : this game works on the xp , vista and 7 and have an afinate touch in what concerne to needed ram and for example to xp ,looks like 1 gb ram do the trick , i have to say that sometimes the games says 1.5 gb ram but at least in some cases i get the idea that 1gb of ram can be ok , so i canÂ´t see why you canÂ´t play the game ."

The folder got extracted all fine but when i try to open Intro Videos Autorun.exe i get an error saying the process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process. Error code:32/103 and another windows says AutoRun CD data file does not exist. Well there isn't any process open when i am trying to open the autorun. So if u could help me with this, it would be nice . Thanks for all your rips and keep up the good work. "

,badimer,2010-12-01T16:00Z,"Hello every1, I think that I'm having a problem like a lot of people. The controls respond only after pressing it a few times, there's no such problem with any other games. I've been looking in a lot of forums, but i didn't find a solution to my problem. So, I would be happy if someone sees this coment, and tries to help, not just me, but I think a lot of gamers, who wants to try this game. Peace. :)"
,bugs3214,2010-12-01T17:21Z,"@globeplus
We know you do these rips only for us and not for those who download your rip and give negative comments. You continue doing the good work buddy. Thanks, globeplus."
,TheBhaasa,2010-12-02T13:36Z,"@ badimer
Yup dude...I am having the same problem..."
,Shoobox,2010-12-05T13:30Z,"@bugs3214 
a true ripper needs to pay attention to negative feedback as well as possitive feedback,
otherwise their mistakes will go unfixed.
if 90% of people are complaining obviously their is a issue."
