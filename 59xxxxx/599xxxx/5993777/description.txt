* Gameplay : *

The player can control four versions of Spider-Man, spanning the Amazing, Noir, 2099, and Ultimate universes. During key moments of gameplay Shattered Dimensions switches to a first-person perspective. During these sequences the player uses the analog sticks to control the given Spider-Man\'s arms, punching their opponent. Developers described these sequences as a reward for the player.
 Each universe\'s Spider-Man has a unique fighting technique that distinguishes him from the others. Amazing Spider-Man uses a combination of melee and web-attacks, such as web hammers designed to combine webbing with the environment, mixing up-close and long range combat. Spider-Man Noir uses stealth and timing to silently defeat his enemies in combat . When the player is in the shadows the screen turns black and white, signifying concealment. When the player is exposed in light the screen becomes colored meaning the character can be seen.
 Spider-Man 2099 uses acrobatics and his suit\'s advanced abilities in combat. He has talons which give him a close combat advantage. He has accelerated vision similar to a spider-reflex which allows him to dodge attacks quickly, much like the Spider-Man 3 video game. Ultimate Spider-Man uses the powers of the symbiote suit to devastate enemies, generating symbiotic spikes and tendrils which act like extensions of his own body. There is also a rage meter for the Ultimate universe, much like the Spider-Man 3 video game.[
